  reason: The actual output directly contradicts the expected output's key factual
    claim. While both correctly identify that PMID 33926573 is retracted, the actual
    output states 'yes, microbes from alkaline sulphidic tailings do show evidence
    of oxidative stress responses' with extensive supporting detail, whereas the expected
    output clearly states 'The paper says No.' This is a fundamental factual contradiction
    about what the paper's findings were, regardless of the retraction status.
  actual_output: "I'll help you analyze PMID 33926573 to understand whether microbes\
    \ from alkaline sulphidic tailings show oxidative stresses. Let me start by retrieving\
    \ the paper details.\nI can see that this paper (PMID 33926573) has been **retracted**\
    \ (as indicated in the pubTypeList and commentCorrectionList). However, I can\
    \ still examine the original content to answer your question about oxidative stress\

    \ **yes, microbes from alkaline sulphidic tailings do show evidence of oxidative\
    \ stress responses**.\n\n## Key Evidence for Oxidative Stress in Alkaline Sulphidic\
    \ Tailings Microbes:\n\n### 1. **Multiple Oxidative Stress Defense Systems Detected**\n\
    The study identified several genes and pathways specifically related to oxidative\
    \ stress resistance across the dominant microbial species:\n\n- **Superoxide dismutases\
    \ (SOD)** - detected in almost all metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs)\n- **Ferroxidase\
    \ genes** - found in nearly all tailings MAGs\n- **Glutathione S-transferase genes\
    \ (GT)** - for oxidative resistance\n- **Methylglyoxal detoxification genes (Glo)**\
    \ - protection against oxidative damage\n- **SAM-dependent methyltransferase genes**\
    \ - stress response mechanisms\n- **Oxidative stress response genes (NO)**\n\n\
    ### 2. **Environmental Stressors Causing Oxidative Damage**\nThe study explains\
    \ why oxidative stress is particularly problematic in these alkaline sulphidic\
    \ tailings:\n\n- **Free Fe\xB2\u207A levels** - The Fenton reaction of intracellular\
    \ Fe\xB2\u207A with superoxide is described as \"fatal to cells\"\n- **High heavy\
    \ metal concentrations** - Cu (1300 mg/kg), Pb (1800 mg/kg), Zn (2900 mg/kg)\n\
    - **Sulphide oxidation processes** - Generate reactive oxygen species\n- **Multiple\
    \ simultaneous stresses** - Including salinity, moisture changes, and metal toxicity\n\
    \n### 3. **Iron Management Systems**\nThe microbes possess sophisticated iron\
    \ acquisition and management systems to deal with iron-induced oxidative stress:\n\
    \n- **Iron uptake systems** (Fur, pit genes)\n- **High-affinity iron transporters**\n\
    - **Ferrous ion transporters**\n\n### 4. **Widespread Distribution**\nThese oxidative\
    \ stress resistance mechanisms were found across multiple dominant genera including:\n\
    - *Rubrobacter* sp.\n- *Truepera* sp. \n- *Thioalkalivibrio* sp.\n- *Acidimicrobium*\
    \ sp.\n- *Rhodomicrobium* sp.\n\nThe study concludes that these **\"powerful resistance\
    \ systems for osmotic, metal and oxidative stresses\"** are essential for microbial\
    \ survival in the hostile alkaline sulphidic tailings environment. The presence\
    \ of multiple, redundant oxidative stress defense mechanisms across different\
    \ microbial species strongly indicates that oxidative stress is a significant\
    \ challenge that these microbes have evolved to address."

              environment stresses for plants'' survival.<h4>Results</h4>In this study,
              we detected a considerable amount of viable bacterial and archaeal cells
              using fluorescent in situ hybridization in alkaline sulphidic tailings
              from Mt Isa, Queensland. By taking advantage of high-throughput sequencing
              and up-to-date metagenomic binning technology, we reconstructed the
              microbial community structure and potential coupled iron and nitrogen
              metabolism pathways in the tailings. Assembly of 10 metagenome-assembled
              genomes (MAGs), with 5 nearly complete, was achieved. From this, detailed
              insights into the community metabolic capabilities was derived. Dominant
              microbial species were seen to possess powerful resistance systems for
              osmotic, metal and oxidative stresses. Additionally, these community
              members had metabolic capabilities for sulphide oxidation, for causing
              increased salinity and metal release, and for leading to N depletion.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Here
              our results show that a considerable amount of microbial cells inhabit
              the mine tailings, who possess a variety of genes for stress response.
              Metabolic reconstruction infers that the microbial consortia may actively
              accelerate the sulphide weathering and N depletion therein.","affiliation":"Hebei

              \ had metabolic capabilities for sulphide oxidation, for causing increased\
              \ salinity and metal release, and for leading to N depletion.\\n## Conclusions\\\
              nHere our results show that a considerable amount of microbial cells\
              \ inhabit the mine tailings, who possess a variety of genes for stress\
              \ response. Metabolic reconstruction infers that the microbial consortia\
              \ may actively accelerate the sulphide weathering and N depletion therein.\\\
              n\\n## Introduction\\n\\nMine tailings are milled residue wastes of\
              \ ore processing. Those of metal mines, typically Pb/Zn/Cu/Ni, always\
              \ contain abundant sulphides that are mostly pyrite based, e.g. FeS2.\
              \ Due to the high reactivity of sulphides, high levels of metals and\
              \ salinity can be generated by the coupled weathering of sulphide and\
              \ carbonate wastes [1]. This makes mine tailings a rather hostile environment\
              \ to microbes, while still a considerable amount cells, though with\
              \ a relatively low diversity compared with normal soils, had been detected\
              \ therein [1]. The contribution of microbial activities to the weathering\
              \ of sulphides has long been recognized in mine tailings. At the acid\
              \ mine drainage (AMD) site of Iron Mountain, Calif., Thiobacillus ferrooxidans\
              \ and Leptospirillum ferrooxidans were found to be dominant in the community\
              \ and contribute to the generation of AMD [2]. In a copper bioleaching\
              \ heap, sulfurophilic and iron-ophilic acidophilic bacteria were found\
              \ to actively colonize the mineral surface [3]. These microbes show\
              \ adaptability to extremely acidic environment and play an important\
              \ role in the sustainability of this system. With the advent of the\
              \ modern molecular tools, community genomics of microbial consortia\
              \ in acid mine environments has been well explored [4, 5], while that\
              \ of alkaline mine tailings has not been extensively studied. Alkaline\
              \ mine environment is normally subjected to revegetation which requires\
              \ the establishment of soil function including microbial diversity [6].\\\
              n\\nMicrobial community networks related to sulphide weathering in neutralized\
              \ tailings have been determined [7, 8], yet these studies are based\
              \ on mainly 16S rRNA gene detection and then possible functions of the\
              \ community members are inferred from physiological information of known\
              \ related pure cultures. This approach is useful but is highly limited\
              \ and speculative with regard to approximating the community metabolic\
              \ capabilities related to the in situ elemental cycling and adaptation\
              \ strategies. In contrast, metagenome-based analyses enable reconstruction\
              \ of nearly complete genomes of microbial community members. Such analyses\
              \ provides detailed insights of metabolic capabilities and enables estimating\
              \ the possible contributions of populations to the community processes\
              \ [5]. Metagenomic approaches have been successfully used to resolve\
              \ the microbial biogeochemical potential in saline sea water [9, 10],\
              \ and to reconstruct microbial metabolism in AMD. It is found that acidophilic\
              \ bacteria community in AMD has a microbial diversity higher than expected\
              \ [11, 12]. Recently, draft genomes acquired through metagenomics have\
              \ been used to understand the bacterial colonization of the infant gut\
              \ [13] and microbial systems in hypersaline lakes [14].\\n\\nIn this\
              \ study, we analyzed metagenomes of alkaline sulphidic tailings from\
              \ a tailings storage facility of northwest Queensland. Microbial metabolic\
              \ capabilities for stress resistance and elemental cycling were implied\
              \ through the annotation of 10 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from\
              \ the tailings metagenomes. The results may provide further understanding\
              \ on biogeochemistry of alkaline sulphidic tailings and valuable inference\
              \ for tailings revegetation practice.\\n\\n## Materials and methods\\\
              n\\n### Sampling\\n\\nSampling sites and methods have been described\
              \ in our previous studies [15, 16]. Briefly, base metal mine tailings\
              \ were sampled from a storage facility Mt Isa, northwest Queensland.\
              \ The microbial community structure based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing\
              \ related to revegetation has been determined and described elsewhere.\
              \ The tailings mainly comprise of quartz, dolomite, pyrite, gypsum and\
              \ kaolinite, and contain approximately 1300, 1800 and 2900 mg/kg of\
              \ residue Cu, Pb and Zn, respectively. The 16S-based amplicon sequencing\
              \ reveals that the dominant microbial species in the tailings include\
              \ Rubrobacter spp. of the Actinobacteria, Truepera spp. of the Deinococcus-Thermus,\
              \ and Thioalkalivibrio spp. and Thiobacillus spp. of the Proteobacteria.\
              \ No substantial changes were detected of the microbial community structure\
              \ in summer and in winter [6], and dominant species changed little in\
              \ spite of significant increases in diversity detected along with the\
              \ revegetation efforts [15].\\n\\n### Fluorescent in situ hybridization\
              \ (FISH)\\n\\nCells from the tailings samples were firstly enriched\
              \ by a sucrose density centrifugation [17], followed by the standard\
              \ FISH procedure for soil with minor modifications [18, 19]. To obtain\
              \ sufficient microbial cells from the tailings, quadruplicates with\
              \ 5 g of tailings each were used for cell enrichment. Oligonucleotide\
              \ probes were used for detecting bacteria (mixed EUB338) and archaea\
              \ (ARCH915) [20]. The hybridized samples were observed within 24 h of\
              \ performing the FISH and images were taken using a ZEISS LSM 510 META\
              \ Confocal Microscope. For enumeration of microorganisms, from each\
              \ sample a total of 30 confocal acquisitions were taken, and 21 quality\
              \ images were used to determine the cell abundances using DAIME 1.3\
              \ [21].\\n\\n### DNA extraction and sequencing\\n\\nDNA extraction was\
              \ done using the PowerSoil\xAE DNA Isolation Kit (MO BIO Laboratories,\
              \ Inc.), after cell enrichment using the previously described protocol\
              \ [17]. A total of seven DNA samples of tailings samples were subjected\
              \ to shotgun sequencing. The sequencing was done at the Institute for\
              \ Molecular Bioscience, The University of Queensland, using Illumina\
              \ MiSeq with paired-end 300 bp reads. The detailed sequencing method\
              \ is described in our previous study [16].\\n\\n### Bioinformatics\\\
              n\\nFor the purpose of high quality assembly of the metagenome, the\
              \ seven metagenomes were pooled together and analyzed using the flexible\
              \ pipeline MetaWRAP [22] for genome-resolved metagenomic data analysis.\
              \ The assembly module was used for sequence assembly. The assembly contigs\
              \ obtained were all longer than 1000 bp. The workflow of MaxBin2 in\
              \ MetaWRAP was used for contig encapsulation. MetaWRAP provides three\
              \ assembly pipelines, namely Concoct, Metabat2 and Maxbin2, and after\
              \ comparison Maxbin2 was chose for subsequent analysis [23]. Then the\
              \ obtained bins were further analyzed for species annotation. Species\
              \ annotation was performed in the annotate_bins module, based on the\
              \ NCBI_nt and NCBI_tax databases. Taxator-tk was used for the classification\
              \ of each contig, and a bin as a whole was estimated to annotate species.\
              \ CheckM was used for the quality assessment of the assembled bins (MAGs;\
              \ https://ecogenomics.github.io/CheckM/). For gene annotation, a cutoff\
              \ E value of 10\u2212 6 and an identity of 70% were used. Metawrap was\
              \ run on a 42-core, 192 GB RAM server. Bins were then used for microbial\

              nThe tailings studied are basically neutral/alkaline in pH and of a\
              \ high level of residue heavy metals, salinity and sulphidic minerals.\
              \ Salinity and metal release in sulphidic tailings is mostly from the\
              \ coupled weathering of sulphides and carbonates. The microbially-mediated\
              \ and chemical-mediated weathering of sulphides would have both occurred\
              \ in the amended and revegetated tailings [15]. The microbial processes\
              \ may become as important as the chemical weathering processes in neutral/alkaline\
              \ sulphidic tailings, where the redox potential of oxygen and ferric\
              \ is reduced by the high pH and ferrous can be oxidized more easily\
              \ with diverse electron-acceptors (e.g. nitrate) [25]. Moreover, increased\
              \ nutrients supplied from the organic matter amendment and plant roots,\
              \ as indicated by our previous studies, is very likely resulting in\
              \ increased activities of the sulphide weathering microorganisms [6].\\\
              n\\n### Cell abundance in the tailings\\n\\nCell abundance in the tailings\
              \ was enumerated using conventional FISH. We examined samples by FISH\
              \ that were prepared as either sterilized raw tailings, the raw tailings\
              \ or a cell enrichment obtained from the tailings by sucrose density\
              \ gradient centrifugation. Strong background fluorescence was observed\
              \ and direct observation of cell fluorescence was impossible for raw\
              \ tailings materials. Background fluorescence is a common problem for\
              \ cell enumeration in soil-like materials using FISH, and can be strong\
              \ in metal tailings due to the presence of abundant uranium, lead and\
              \ molybdenum minerals.\\n\\nThe FISH images taken on tailings samples\
              \ prepared by cell enrichment were of good quality and suitable for\
              \ cell enumeration (Fig. 1). The bacterial cell number in the tailings\
              \ was estimated to be approximately 107 cells/g tailings, assuming the\
              \ cell extraction efficiency to be 10%. Bacteria made up the major component\
              \ of the cells and Archaea were only scarcely detected. We did not detect\
              \ any difference of the cell abundances between the tailings with and\
              \ without revegetation. The bacterial and archaeal cell abundances in\
              \ these tailings is close to those reported for other base metal tailings\
              \ [7, 20]. Fig. 1A representative FISH image (magnification, \xD7 100)\
              \ of the bacterial (green, FITC dyes) and archaeal cells (red, Cy3 dyes)\
              \ detected in the tailing\\n\\n### The community genomics\\n\\nThe analysis\
              \ of 5 Gb of sequenced DNA obtained from the tailing samples resulted\
              \ in 10 genomic bins belonging to eight genera (Table 1). Five of the\
              \ 10 MAGs, Rubrobacter sp., Truepera sp., Thioalkalivibrio sp., Acidimicrobium\
              \ sp. and Rhodomicrobium sp., had high completeness of > 90% and a contamination\
              \ rate of 1.35\u20134.87%. Our previous studies based on 16S rRNA amplicon\
              \ sequencing showed that these 5 genera on average accounted for > 12%\
              \ of the total communities in the tailings sampled. These 5 MAGs were\
              \ of high quality, which were binned with an N50 of 9307\u201332,314\
              \ bp, with the longest contigs ranging between 51,994\u2013209,767 bp\
              \ and the number of coding sequences ranging between 2963 and 4168.\
              \ Five other bins were obtained of a lower quality but with a completeness\
              \ > 50%. These results enabled the metabolic capacities of the communities\
              \ to be determined and these capacities could be related to the tailings\u2019\
              \ bio-weathering. All the microbial genetic features discussed here\
              \ were based on the annotation of contigs with a length > 8000 bp. Restricting\
              \ the analyses to large contigs would serve to minimize system errors\
              \ such as those caused by sequencing and bioinformatic assembly. This\
              \ metagenomic-based analysis allows a comprehensive estimation of the\
              \ community metabolic networks [5]. Additionally, the sequencing depth\
              \ obtained here was much greater than that of previous metagenomic studies\
              \ of other tailings communities [26], which in this instance enabled\
              \ good estimations of the community metabolic capabilities. Table 1General\

              \ the near complete MAGs, Rubrobacter sp., Thioalkalivibrio sp. and\
              \ Thiobacillus sp., were identified to have prominent capacities for\
              \ acquiring energy and stress resistance in the tailing environment\
              \ (Table 2). Rubrobacter sp. had a wide spectrum of genes for utilizing\
              \ polysaccharides and aromatic compounds, such as the pca [27], sal\
              \ [28], cat [29] and bpa [27] operons. This kind of capability would\
              \ be particularly important considering tailings are an oligotrophic\
              \ environment [15], and in this instance, the organic amendment for\
              \ revegetation in the form of woodchips would have caused an increase\
              \ in content of polysaccharides and chitin [30]. However, it is worth\
              \ noting that the N content of the tailings and woodchips was very low,\
              \ which would have impeded the decomposition of the woodchips in the\
              \ long run [31]. Our recent studies report a very slow decomposition\
              \ of litter amendment in the tailings. Nonetheless, the utilization\
              \ of diverse organic molecules such as polysaccharides and aromatic\
              \ compounds may be a vital survival strategy for these microbes after\
              \ depleting easily labile and soluble organic carbon. Table 2Genetic\

              \ have found niches within the tailings by consuming sulphides and respiring\
              \ on nitrates, as inferred by the presence of sulfur-oxidizing and denitrification\
              \ genes in their binned MAGs. Interestingly, Rubrobacter sp. and Acidimicrobium\
              \ sp. were found to have cox operons for CO oxidation, inferring an\
              \ ability to respire on CO. CO utilization has been documented for many\
              \ microbes residing in saline environments, such as in seawater [32]\
              \ and saline soils [33]. In addition, four out of the eight genera were\
              \ found to contain genes for CO2 fixation, in the form of a minimum\
              \ set of cbbLSX [34] (Fig. 2). The findings imply these genera can utilize\
              \ atmospheric carbon sources, and this may greatly increase their survival\
              \ ability in the oligotrophic tailings environment. Fig. 2A Neighbor-Joining\

              nThe ability of microbes to cope with salinity and metal (loid) stress\
              \ in the tailings was evident in the annotated MAGs. Various genes for\
              \ osmotic stress resistance were detected in the MAGs of Rubrobacter\
              \ sp., Truepera sp., Thioalkalivibrio sp., and Acidimicrobium sp.. These\
              \ included bet and pro systems that code for the choline monooxygenase/betaine\
              \ aldehyde dehydrogenase pathway [27] and for the L-proline glycine\
              \ betaine ABC transport system [28], respectively. Genes coding for\
              \ resistance to all the metals Zn, Cd, As, Cu and Pb were detected in\
              \ all genera. Impressively, multiple copies of czc, encoding for Co-Zn-Cd\
              \ resistance, were frequently detected in one contig (Fig. 3). All the\
              \ MAGs contained both the pco and cop systems for Cu resistance, and\
              \ 6 out of the 8 genera had both the ACR3 and ars systems for As resistance\
              \ (Table 2). The high frequency of these systems emphasizes the importance\
              \ of metal resistance for microbial survival in the tailings [16]. Fig.\

              \ details can be found in the notes of Table 2\\n\\nSulphidic metal\
              \ tailings are an environment where multiple stresses will occur. This\
              \ includes those of oxidative damage (such as from free Fe2+ [32]),\
              \ salinity [29], moisture content changes [34], and extremely high levels\
              \ of heavy metals [33]. The Fenton reaction of intracellular Fe2+ by\
              \ superoxide is fatal to cells [32]. We detected genes for ferroxidase\
              \ (Fig. 4) and superoxide dismutases as well as genes for Fe uptake\
              \ systems (e.g. Fur, pit) in almost all the tailings MAGs. Likely, these\
              \ genes are providing these microorganisms with defenses against oxidative\
              \ stress. Other protection mechanisms like methylglyoxal detoxification\
              \ genes [35] and glutaredoxin genes [36] were also detected in most\
              \ of the MAGs. Fig. 4A Neighbor-Joining tree showing the phylogenetics\
              \ of the ferroxidase genes recovered from the binned genomes in this\
              \ study. The tree was constructed using MEGA 6.06 based on the sequence\
              \ alignment using the CLUSTAL method with default parameters\\n\\n###\
              \ Sulphide oxidation and salinity generation\\n\\nKEGG annotation successfully\
              \ reconstructed the metabolic capacity of sulphide oxidation and nitrogen\
              \ cycling of the microbial consortia, which may be vital for the survival\
              \ of the community via inter-species cooperation (Fig. 5). Two microbial\
              \ pathways for sulphide oxidation, the direct contact pathway and indirect\
              \ pathway [37, 38], may exist in the tailings (Fig. 5). Thioalkalivibrio\
              \ sp., Acidimicrobium sp. and Thiobacillus sp. are well known sulfur\
              \ oxidizers able to respire on sulphides [39, 40], and in this study\
              \ dsr (organized as dsrABCKJOPR) and sox (organized as soxXYZABH) genes\
              \ for sulphur oxidation were found in these three MAGs from the tailings.\
              \ Thioalkalivibrio sp. and Thiobacillus sp. were both found to harbor\
              \ novel conserved genes (Blr3520 genes) annotated for sulfur oxidation\
              \ as well. In addition, msh operons encoding mannose-sensitive haemagglutinin\
              \ (MSHA)-like pilus for cell attachment to substrates [41] were detected\
              \ in the Thioalkalivibrio sp. genome. This indicated the ability of\
              \ Thioalkalivibrio sp. to attach to pyrite surfaces for oxidation activities.\
              \ Microbes can colonize and etch pyrite surfaces directly and oxidize\
              \ the released sulfur, which was recently observed during ferric-catalyzed\
              \ pyrite oxidation [38]. The features detected in the abovementioned\
              \ genomes coincide with this model. It is thus suggested that in the\
              \ oxic layer of the tailings Thioalkalivibrio sp., Acidimicrobium sp.\
              \ and Thiobacillus sp. may colonize and oxidize sulphides particles\
              \ directly, causing mineral dissolution and contributing to the elevated\
              \ levels of salinity and metals in the pore water. Fig. 5A conceptual\
              \ diagram depicting the microbial mediated sulphide oxidation resulting\
              \ salinity and N depletion in the tailings. DMO, direct microbial oxidation;\
              \ IO, inorganic oxidation; IMO, indirect microbial oxidation\\n\\nGenomic\
              \ features detected here also inferred an indirect oxidation of sulphides\
              \ in the tailings through the coupled reactions of ferrous oxidation\
              \ and nitrate reduction which may occur in an anoxic layer. Diverse\
              \ ferroxidases were detected in all the MAGs (Table 2), indicating intensive\
              \ microbial activities to regenerate ferric which is a strong oxidant\
              \ for sulphide dissolution [38]. Additionally, a full set of denitrification\
              \ genes (nar, nir, nor, nos) were detected in the Thioalkalivibrio sp.\
              \ and Thiobacillus sp. MAGs. It has been determined that total nitrogen\
              \ is extremely low (< 0.006%) in the tailings and most of this is in\
              \ the form of microbial biomass (50\u2013100%) [15]. There is the possibility\
              \ that anaerobic microbial sulphide oxidation has occurred here with\
              \ nitrate as electron acceptor. Other studies showed that pyrite minerals\
              \ of nano-size were oxidized by Thiobacillus denitrificans with nitrate\
              \ as electron acceptor [42]. Sulphides in the tailings used in this\
              \ study may favor this indirect pathway due to their texture dominated\
              \ by fine silt when nitrate is present. This claim about the role of\
              \ nitrate in sulfide oxidation requires experimental verification in\
              \ purposely designed physiological tests.\\n\\nNitrogen deficiency is\
              \ a common problem in tailings limiting plant growth, and its microbial\
              \ cycling has not been well studied for neutral/alkaline metal tailings\
              \ [15]. Our results highlight the possibility of nitrate-depletion by\
              \ microbial sulphides oxidation as well as by CO oxidation [33] in the\
              \ tailings. Nitrogen fixing mechanisms in the tailings remains largely\
              \ unknown. The key nitrogen fixing genes were not detected, with only\
              \ nifU present in the Rubrobacter sp. and Acidimicrobium sp. MAGs.\\\
              n\\n## The environment\\n\\nThe tailings studied are basically neutral/alkaline\
              \ in pH and of a high level of residue heavy metals, salinity and sulphidic\
              \ minerals. Salinity and metal release in sulphidic tailings is mostly\
              \ from the coupled weathering of sulphides and carbonates. The microbially-mediated\
              \ and chemical-mediated weathering of sulphides would have both occurred\
              \ in the amended and revegetated tailings [15]. The microbial processes\
              \ may become as important as the chemical weathering processes in neutral/alkaline\
              \ sulphidic tailings, where the redox potential of oxygen and ferric\
              \ is reduced by the high pH and ferrous can be oxidized more easily\
              \ with diverse electron-acceptors (e.g. nitrate) [25]. Moreover, increased\
              \ nutrients supplied from the organic matter amendment and plant roots,\
              \ as indicated by our previous studies, is very likely resulting in\
              \ increased activities of the sulphide weathering microorganisms [6].\\\
              n\\n## Cell abundance in the tailings\\n\\nCell abundance in the tailings\
              \ was enumerated using conventional FISH. We examined samples by FISH\
              \ that were prepared as either sterilized raw tailings, the raw tailings\
              \ or a cell enrichment obtained from the tailings by sucrose density\
              \ gradient centrifugation. Strong background fluorescence was observed\
              \ and direct observation of cell fluorescence was impossible for raw\
              \ tailings materials. Background fluorescence is a common problem for\
              \ cell enumeration in soil-like materials using FISH, and can be strong\
              \ in metal tailings due to the presence of abundant uranium, lead and\
              \ molybdenum minerals.\\n\\nThe FISH images taken on tailings samples\
              \ prepared by cell enrichment were of good quality and suitable for\
              \ cell enumeration (Fig. 1). The bacterial cell number in the tailings\
              \ was estimated to be approximately 107 cells/g tailings, assuming the\
              \ cell extraction efficiency to be 10%. Bacteria made up the major component\
              \ of the cells and Archaea were only scarcely detected. We did not detect\
              \ any difference of the cell abundances between the tailings with and\
              \ without revegetation. The bacterial and archaeal cell abundances in\
              \ these tailings is close to those reported for other base metal tailings\
              \ [7, 20]. Fig. 1A representative FISH image (magnification, \xD7 100)\
              \ of the bacterial (green, FITC dyes) and archaeal cells (red, Cy3 dyes)\
              \ detected in the tailing\\n\\n## The community genomics\\n\\nThe analysis\
              \ of 5 Gb of sequenced DNA obtained from the tailing samples resulted\
              \ in 10 genomic bins belonging to eight genera (Table 1). Five of the\
              \ 10 MAGs, Rubrobacter sp., Truepera sp., Thioalkalivibrio sp., Acidimicrobium\
              \ sp. and Rhodomicrobium sp., had high completeness of > 90% and a contamination\
              \ rate of 1.35\u20134.87%. Our previous studies based on 16S rRNA amplicon\
              \ sequencing showed that these 5 genera on average accounted for > 12%\
              \ of the total communities in the tailings sampled. These 5 MAGs were\
              \ of high quality, which were binned with an N50 of 9307\u201332,314\
              \ bp, with the longest contigs ranging between 51,994\u2013209,767 bp\
              \ and the number of coding sequences ranging between 2963 and 4168.\
              \ Five other bins were obtained of a lower quality but with a completeness\
              \ > 50%. These results enabled the metabolic capacities of the communities\
              \ to be determined and these capacities could be related to the tailings\u2019\
              \ bio-weathering. All the microbial genetic features discussed here\
              \ were based on the annotation of contigs with a length > 8000 bp. Restricting\
              \ the analyses to large contigs would serve to minimize system errors\
              \ such as those caused by sequencing and bioinformatic assembly. This\
              \ metagenomic-based analysis allows a comprehensive estimation of the\
              \ community metabolic networks [5]. Additionally, the sequencing depth\
              \ obtained here was much greater than that of previous metagenomic studies\
              \ of other tailings communities [26], which in this instance enabled\
              \ good estimations of the community metabolic capabilities. Table 1General\

              \ the near complete MAGs, Rubrobacter sp., Thioalkalivibrio sp. and\
              \ Thiobacillus sp., were identified to have prominent capacities for\
              \ acquiring energy and stress resistance in the tailing environment\
              \ (Table 2). Rubrobacter sp. had a wide spectrum of genes for utilizing\
              \ polysaccharides and aromatic compounds, such as the pca [27], sal\
              \ [28], cat [29] and bpa [27] operons. This kind of capability would\
              \ be particularly important considering tailings are an oligotrophic\
              \ environment [15], and in this instance, the organic amendment for\
              \ revegetation in the form of woodchips would have caused an increase\
              \ in content of polysaccharides and chitin [30]. However, it is worth\
              \ noting that the N content of the tailings and woodchips was very low,\
              \ which would have impeded the decomposition of the woodchips in the\
              \ long run [31]. Our recent studies report a very slow decomposition\
              \ of litter amendment in the tailings. Nonetheless, the utilization\
              \ of diverse organic molecules such as polysaccharides and aromatic\

              nThe ability of microbes to cope with salinity and metal (loid) stress\
              \ in the tailings was evident in the annotated MAGs. Various genes for\
              \ osmotic stress resistance were detected in the MAGs of Rubrobacter\
              \ sp., Truepera sp., Thioalkalivibrio sp., and Acidimicrobium sp.. These\
              \ included bet and pro systems that code for the choline monooxygenase/betaine\
              \ aldehyde dehydrogenase pathway [27] and for the L-proline glycine\
              \ betaine ABC transport system [28], respectively. Genes coding for\
              \ resistance to all the metals Zn, Cd, As, Cu and Pb were detected in\
              \ all genera. Impressively, multiple copies of czc, encoding for Co-Zn-Cd\
              \ resistance, were frequently detected in one contig (Fig. 3). All the\
              \ MAGs contained both the pco and cop systems for Cu resistance, and\
              \ 6 out of the 8 genera had both the ACR3 and ars systems for As resistance\
              \ (Table 2). The high frequency of these systems emphasizes the importance\
              \ of metal resistance for microbial survival in the tailings [16]. Fig.\

              \ tailings are an environment where multiple stresses will occur. This\
              \ includes those of oxidative damage (such as from free Fe2+ [32]),\
              \ salinity [29], moisture content changes [34], and extremely high levels\
              \ of heavy metals [33]. The Fenton reaction of intracellular Fe2+ by\
              \ superoxide is fatal to cells [32]. We detected genes for ferroxidase\
              \ (Fig. 4) and superoxide dismutases as well as genes for Fe uptake\
              \ systems (e.g. Fur, pit) in almost all the tailings MAGs. Likely, these\
              \ genes are providing these microorganisms with defenses against oxidative\
              \ stress. Other protection mechanisms like methylglyoxal detoxification\
              \ genes [35] and glutaredoxin genes [36] were also detected in most\
              \ of the MAGs. Fig. 4A Neighbor-Joining tree showing the phylogenetics\

              \ Sulphide oxidation and salinity generation\\n\\nKEGG annotation successfully\
              \ reconstructed the metabolic capacity of sulphide oxidation and nitrogen\
              \ cycling of the microbial consortia, which may be vital for the survival\
              \ of the community via inter-species cooperation (Fig. 5). Two microbial\
              \ pathways for sulphide oxidation, the direct contact pathway and indirect\
              \ pathway [37, 38], may exist in the tailings (Fig. 5). Thioalkalivibrio\
              \ sp., Acidimicrobium sp. and Thiobacillus sp. are well known sulfur\
              \ oxidizers able to respire on sulphides [39, 40], and in this study\
              \ dsr (organized as dsrABCKJOPR) and sox (organized as soxXYZABH) genes\
              \ for sulphur oxidation were found in these three MAGs from the tailings.\
              \ Thioalkalivibrio sp. and Thiobacillus sp. were both found to harbor\
              \ novel conserved genes (Blr3520 genes) annotated for sulfur oxidation\
              \ as well. In addition, msh operons encoding mannose-sensitive haemagglutinin\
              \ (MSHA)-like pilus for cell attachment to substrates [41] were detected\
              \ in the Thioalkalivibrio sp. genome. This indicated the ability of\
              \ Thioalkalivibrio sp. to attach to pyrite surfaces for oxidation activities.\
              \ Microbes can colonize and etch pyrite surfaces directly and oxidize\
              \ the released sulfur, which was recently observed during ferric-catalyzed\
              \ pyrite oxidation [38]. The features detected in the abovementioned\
              \ genomes coincide with this model. It is thus suggested that in the\
              \ oxic layer of the tailings Thioalkalivibrio sp., Acidimicrobium sp.\
              \ and Thiobacillus sp. may colonize and oxidize sulphides particles\
              \ directly, causing mineral dissolution and contributing to the elevated\
              \ levels of salinity and metals in the pore water. Fig. 5A conceptual\

              \ salinity and N depletion in the tailings. DMO, direct microbial oxidation;\
              \ IO, inorganic oxidation; IMO, indirect microbial oxidation\\n\\nGenomic\
              \ features detected here also inferred an indirect oxidation of sulphides\
              \ in the tailings through the coupled reactions of ferrous oxidation\
              \ and nitrate reduction which may occur in an anoxic layer. Diverse\
              \ ferroxidases were detected in all the MAGs (Table 2), indicating intensive\
              \ microbial activities to regenerate ferric which is a strong oxidant\
              \ for sulphide dissolution [38]. Additionally, a full set of denitrification\
              \ genes (nar, nir, nor, nos) were detected in the Thioalkalivibrio sp.\
              \ and Thiobacillus sp. MAGs. It has been determined that total nitrogen\
              \ is extremely low (< 0.006%) in the tailings and most of this is in\
              \ the form of microbial biomass (50\u2013100%) [15]. There is the possibility\
              \ that anaerobic microbial sulphide oxidation has occurred here with\
              \ nitrate as electron acceptor. Other studies showed that pyrite minerals\
              \ of nano-size were oxidized by Thiobacillus denitrificans with nitrate\
              \ as electron acceptor [42]. Sulphides in the tailings used in this\
              \ study may favor this indirect pathway due to their texture dominated\
              \ by fine silt when nitrate is present. This claim about the role of\
              \ nitrate in sulfide oxidation requires experimental verification in\
              \ purposely designed physiological tests.\\n\\nNitrogen deficiency is\
              \ a common problem in tailings limiting plant growth, and its microbial\
              \ cycling has not been well studied for neutral/alkaline metal tailings\
              \ [15]. Our results highlight the possibility of nitrate-depletion by\
              \ microbial sulphides oxidation as well as by CO oxidation [33] in the\
              \ tailings. Nitrogen fixing mechanisms in the tailings remains largely\
              \ unknown. The key nitrogen fixing genes were not detected, with only\
              \ nifU present in the Rubrobacter sp. and Acidimicrobium sp. MAGs.\\\

              \ tailings are milled residue wastes of ore processing. Those of metal\
              \ mines, typically Pb/Zn/Cu/Ni, always contain abundant sulphides that\
              \ are mostly pyrite based, e.g. FeS2. Due to the high reactivity of\
              \ sulphides, high levels of metals and salinity can be generated by\
              \ the coupled weathering of sulphide and carbonate wastes [1]. This\
              \ makes mine tailings a rather hostile environment to microbes, while\
              \ still a considerable amount cells, though with a relatively low diversity\
              \ compared with normal soils, had been detected therein [1]. The contribution\
              \ of microbial activities to the weathering of sulphides has long been\
              \ recognized in mine tailings. At the acid mine drainage (AMD) site\
              \ of Iron Mountain, Calif., Thiobacillus ferrooxidans and Leptospirillum\
              \ ferrooxidans were found to be dominant in the community and contribute\
              \ to the generation of AMD [2]. In a copper bioleaching heap, sulfurophilic\
              \ and iron-ophilic acidophilic bacteria were found to actively colonize\
              \ the mineral surface [3]. These microbes show adaptability to extremely\
              \ acidic environment and play an important role in the sustainability\
              \ of this system. With the advent of the modern molecular tools, community\
              \ genomics of microbial consortia in acid mine environments has been\
              \ well explored [4, 5], while that of alkaline mine tailings has not\
              \ been extensively studied. Alkaline mine environment is normally subjected\
              \ to revegetation which requires the establishment of soil function\
              \ including microbial diversity [6].Microbial community networks related\
              \ to sulphide weathering in neutralized tailings have been determined\
              \ [7, 8], yet these studies are based on mainly 16S rRNA gene detection\
              \ and then possible functions of the community members are inferred\

          \ alkaline sulphidic tailings do show evidence of oxidative stress responses**.\n\
          \n## Key Evidence for Oxidative Stress in Alkaline Sulphidic Tailings Microbes:\n\
          \n### 1. **Multiple Oxidative Stress Defense Systems Detected**\nThe study\
          \ identified several genes and pathways specifically related to oxidative\
          \ stress resistance across the dominant microbial species:\n\n- **Superoxide\
          \ dismutases (SOD)** - detected in almost all metagenome-assembled genomes\
          \ (MAGs)\n- **Ferroxidase genes** - found in nearly all tailings MAGs\n\
          - **Glutathione S-transferase genes (GT)** - for oxidative resistance\n\
          - **Methylglyoxal detoxification genes (Glo)** - protection against oxidative\
          \ damage\n- **SAM-dependent methyltransferase genes** - stress response\
          \ mechanisms\n- **Oxidative stress response genes (NO)**\n\n### 2. **Environmental\
          \ Stressors Causing Oxidative Damage**\nThe study explains why oxidative\
          \ stress is particularly problematic in these alkaline sulphidic tailings:\n\
          \n- **Free Fe\xB2\u207A levels** - The Fenton reaction of intracellular\
          \ Fe\xB2\u207A with superoxide is described as \"fatal to cells\"\n- **High\
          \ heavy metal concentrations** - Cu (1300 mg/kg), Pb (1800 mg/kg), Zn (2900\
          \ mg/kg)\n- **Sulphide oxidation processes** - Generate reactive oxygen\
          \ species\n- **Multiple simultaneous stresses** - Including salinity, moisture\
          \ changes, and metal toxicity\n\n### 3. **Iron Management Systems**\nThe\
          \ microbes possess sophisticated iron acquisition and management systems\
          \ to deal with iron-induced oxidative stress:\n\n- **Iron uptake systems**\
          \ (Fur, pit genes)\n- **High-affinity iron transporters**\n- **Ferrous ion\
          \ transporters**\n\n### 4. **Widespread Distribution**\nThese oxidative\
          \ stress resistance mechanisms were found across multiple dominant genera\
          \ including:\n- *Rubrobacter* sp.\n- *Truepera* sp. \n- *Thioalkalivibrio*\
          \ sp.\n- *Acidimicrobium* sp.\n- *Rhodomicrobium* sp.\n\nThe study concludes\
          \ that these **\"powerful resistance systems for osmotic, metal and oxidative\
          \ stresses\"** are essential for microbial survival in the hostile alkaline\
          \ sulphidic tailings environment. The presence of multiple, redundant oxidative\
          \ stress defense mechanisms across different microbial species strongly\
          \ indicates that oxidative stress is a significant challenge that these\
          \ microbes have evolved to address."

        n\\nMine tailings are milled residue wastes of ore processing. Those of metal\
        \ mines, typically Pb/Zn/Cu/Ni, always contain abundant sulphides that are\
        \ mostly pyrite based, e.g. FeS2. Due to the high reactivity of sulphides,\
        \ high levels of metals and salinity can be generated by the coupled weathering\
        \ of sulphide and carbonate wastes [1]. This makes mine tailings a rather\
        \ hostile environment to microbes, while still a considerable amount cells,\
        \ though with a relatively low diversity compared with normal soils, had been\
        \ detected therein [1]. The contribution of microbial activities to the weathering\
        \ of sulphides has long been recognized in mine tailings. At the acid mine\
        \ drainage (AMD) site of Iron Mountain, Calif., Thiobacillus ferrooxidans\
        \ and Leptospirillum ferrooxidans were found to be dominant in the community\
        \ and contribute to the generation of AMD [2]. In a copper bioleaching heap,\
        \ sulfurophilic and iron-ophilic acidophilic bacteria were found to actively\
        \ colonize the mineral surface [3]. These microbes show adaptability to extremely\
        \ acidic environment and play an important role in the sustainability of this\
        \ system. With the advent of the modern molecular tools, community genomics\
        \ of microbial consortia in acid mine environments has been well explored\
        \ [4, 5], while that of alkaline mine tailings has not been extensively studied.\
        \ Alkaline mine environment is normally subjected to revegetation which requires\
        \ the establishment of soil function including microbial diversity [6].\\\
        n\\nMicrobial community networks related to sulphide weathering in neutralized\
        \ tailings have been determined [7, 8], yet these studies are based on mainly\
        \ 16S rRNA gene detection and then possible functions of the community members\
        \ are inferred from physiological information of known related pure cultures.\
        \ This approach is useful but is highly limited and speculative with regard\
        \ to approximating the community metabolic capabilities related to the in\
        \ situ elemental cycling and adaptation strategies. In contrast, metagenome-based\
        \ analyses enable reconstruction of nearly complete genomes of microbial community\
        \ members. Such analyses provides detailed insights of metabolic capabilities\
        \ and enables estimating the possible contributions of populations to the\
        \ community processes [5]. Metagenomic approaches have been successfully used\
        \ to resolve the microbial biogeochemical potential in saline sea water [9,\
        \ 10], and to reconstruct microbial metabolism in AMD. It is found that acidophilic\
        \ bacteria community in AMD has a microbial diversity higher than expected\
        \ [11, 12]. Recently, draft genomes acquired through metagenomics have been\
        \ used to understand the bacterial colonization of the infant gut [13] and\
        \ microbial systems in hypersaline lakes [14].\\n\\nIn this study, we analyzed\
        \ metagenomes of alkaline sulphidic tailings from a tailings storage facility\
        \ of northwest Queensland. Microbial metabolic capabilities for stress resistance\
        \ and elemental cycling were implied through the annotation of 10 metagenome-assembled\
        \ genomes (MAGs) from the tailings metagenomes. The results may provide further\
        \ understanding on biogeochemistry of alkaline sulphidic tailings and valuable\
        \ inference for tailings revegetation practice.\\n\\n## Materials and methods\\\
        n\\n### Sampling\\n\\nSampling sites and methods have been described in our\
        \ previous studies [15, 16]. Briefly, base metal mine tailings were sampled\
        \ from a storage facility Mt Isa, northwest Queensland. The microbial community\
        \ structure based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing related to revegetation has\
        \ been determined and described elsewhere. The tailings mainly comprise of\
        \ quartz, dolomite, pyrite, gypsum and kaolinite, and contain approximately\
        \ 1300, 1800 and 2900 mg/kg of residue Cu, Pb and Zn, respectively. The 16S-based\
        \ amplicon sequencing reveals that the dominant microbial species in the tailings\
        \ include Rubrobacter spp. of the Actinobacteria, Truepera spp. of the Deinococcus-Thermus,\
        \ and Thioalkalivibrio spp. and Thiobacillus spp. of the Proteobacteria. No\
        \ substantial changes were detected of the microbial community structure in\
        \ summer and in winter [6], and dominant species changed little in spite of\
        \ significant increases in diversity detected along with the revegetation\
        \ efforts [15].\\n\\n### Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH)\\n\\nCells\
        \ from the tailings samples were firstly enriched by a sucrose density centrifugation\
        \ [17], followed by the standard FISH procedure for soil with minor modifications\
        \ [18, 19]. To obtain sufficient microbial cells from the tailings, quadruplicates\
        \ with 5 g of tailings each were used for cell enrichment. Oligonucleotide\
        \ probes were used for detecting bacteria (mixed EUB338) and archaea (ARCH915)\
        \ [20]. The hybridized samples were observed within 24 h of performing the\
        \ FISH and images were taken using a ZEISS LSM 510 META Confocal Microscope.\
        \ For enumeration of microorganisms, from each sample a total of 30 confocal\
        \ acquisitions were taken, and 21 quality images were used to determine the\
        \ cell abundances using DAIME 1.3 [21].\\n\\n### DNA extraction and sequencing\\\
        n\\nDNA extraction was done using the PowerSoil\xAE DNA Isolation Kit (MO\
        \ BIO Laboratories, Inc.), after cell enrichment using the previously described\
        \ protocol [17]. A total of seven DNA samples of tailings samples were subjected\
        \ to shotgun sequencing. The sequencing was done at the Institute for Molecular\
        \ Bioscience, The University of Queensland, using Illumina MiSeq with paired-end\
        \ 300 bp reads. The detailed sequencing method is described in our previous\
        \ study [16].\\n\\n### Bioinformatics\\n\\nFor the purpose of high quality\
        \ assembly of the metagenome, the seven metagenomes were pooled together and\
        \ analyzed using the flexible pipeline MetaWRAP [22] for genome-resolved metagenomic\
        \ data analysis. The assembly module was used for sequence assembly. The assembly\
        \ contigs obtained were all longer than 1000 bp. The workflow of MaxBin2 in\
        \ MetaWRAP was used for contig encapsulation. MetaWRAP provides three assembly\
        \ pipelines, namely Concoct, Metabat2 and Maxbin2, and after comparison Maxbin2\
        \ was chose for subsequent analysis [23]. Then the obtained bins were further\
        \ analyzed for species annotation. Species annotation was performed in the\
        \ annotate_bins module, based on the NCBI_nt and NCBI_tax databases. Taxator-tk\
        \ was used for the classification of each contig, and a bin as a whole was\
        \ estimated to annotate species. CheckM was used for the quality assessment\
        \ of the assembled bins (MAGs; https://ecogenomics.github.io/CheckM/). For\
        \ gene annotation, a cutoff E value of 10\u2212 6 and an identity of 70% were\
        \ used. Metawrap was run on a 42-core, 192 GB RAM server. Bins were then used\
        \ for microbial metabolic pathway analysis using the online analysis platform\
        \ KEGG [24].\\n\\n## Sampling\\n\\nSampling sites and methods have been described\
        \ in our previous studies [15, 16]. Briefly, base metal mine tailings were\
        \ sampled from a storage facility Mt Isa, northwest Queensland. The microbial\
        \ community structure based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing related to revegetation\

        \ analyzed using the flexible pipeline MetaWRAP [22] for genome-resolved metagenomic\
        \ data analysis. The assembly module was used for sequence assembly. The assembly\
        \ contigs obtained were all longer than 1000 bp. The workflow of MaxBin2 in\
        \ MetaWRAP was used for contig encapsulation. MetaWRAP provides three assembly\
        \ pipelines, namely Concoct, Metabat2 and Maxbin2, and after comparison Maxbin2\
        \ was chose for subsequent analysis [23]. Then the obtained bins were further\
        \ analyzed for species annotation. Species annotation was performed in the\
        \ annotate_bins module, based on the NCBI_nt and NCBI_tax databases. Taxator-tk\
        \ was used for the classification of each contig, and a bin as a whole was\
        \ estimated to annotate species. CheckM was used for the quality assessment\
        \ of the assembled bins (MAGs; https://ecogenomics.github.io/CheckM/). For\
        \ gene annotation, a cutoff E value of 10\u2212 6 and an identity of 70% were\
        \ used. Metawrap was run on a 42-core, 192 GB RAM server. Bins were then used\
        \ for microbial metabolic pathway analysis using the online analysis platform\
        \ KEGG [24].\\n\\n## Results and discussion\\n\\n### The environment\\n\\\
        nThe tailings studied are basically neutral/alkaline in pH and of a high level\
        \ of residue heavy metals, salinity and sulphidic minerals. Salinity and metal\
        \ release in sulphidic tailings is mostly from the coupled weathering of sulphides\
        \ and carbonates. The microbially-mediated and chemical-mediated weathering\
        \ of sulphides would have both occurred in the amended and revegetated tailings\
        \ [15]. The microbial processes may become as important as the chemical weathering\
        \ processes in neutral/alkaline sulphidic tailings, where the redox potential\
        \ of oxygen and ferric is reduced by the high pH and ferrous can be oxidized\
        \ more easily with diverse electron-acceptors (e.g. nitrate) [25]. Moreover,\
        \ increased nutrients supplied from the organic matter amendment and plant\
        \ roots, as indicated by our previous studies, is very likely resulting in\
        \ increased activities of the sulphide weathering microorganisms [6].\\n\\\
        n### Cell abundance in the tailings\\n\\nCell abundance in the tailings was\
        \ enumerated using conventional FISH. We examined samples by FISH that were\
        \ prepared as either sterilized raw tailings, the raw tailings or a cell enrichment\
        \ obtained from the tailings by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Strong\
        \ background fluorescence was observed and direct observation of cell fluorescence\
        \ was impossible for raw tailings materials. Background fluorescence is a\
        \ common problem for cell enumeration in soil-like materials using FISH, and\
        \ can be strong in metal tailings due to the presence of abundant uranium,\
        \ lead and molybdenum minerals.\\n\\nThe FISH images taken on tailings samples\
        \ prepared by cell enrichment were of good quality and suitable for cell enumeration\
        \ (Fig. 1). The bacterial cell number in the tailings was estimated to be\
        \ approximately 107 cells/g tailings, assuming the cell extraction efficiency\
        \ to be 10%. Bacteria made up the major component of the cells and Archaea\
        \ were only scarcely detected. We did not detect any difference of the cell\
        \ abundances between the tailings with and without revegetation. The bacterial\
        \ and archaeal cell abundances in these tailings is close to those reported\
        \ for other base metal tailings [7, 20]. Fig. 1A representative FISH image\
        \ (magnification, \xD7 100) of the bacterial (green, FITC dyes) and archaeal\
        \ cells (red, Cy3 dyes) detected in the tailing\\n\\n### The community genomics\\\
        n\\nThe analysis of 5 Gb of sequenced DNA obtained from the tailing samples\
        \ resulted in 10 genomic bins belonging to eight genera (Table 1). Five of\
        \ the 10 MAGs, Rubrobacter sp., Truepera sp., Thioalkalivibrio sp., Acidimicrobium\
        \ sp. and Rhodomicrobium sp., had high completeness of > 90% and a contamination\
        \ rate of 1.35\u20134.87%. Our previous studies based on 16S rRNA amplicon\
        \ sequencing showed that these 5 genera on average accounted for > 12% of\
        \ the total communities in the tailings sampled. These 5 MAGs were of high\
        \ quality, which were binned with an N50 of 9307\u201332,314 bp, with the\
        \ longest contigs ranging between 51,994\u2013209,767 bp and the number of\
        \ coding sequences ranging between 2963 and 4168. Five other bins were obtained\
        \ of a lower quality but with a completeness > 50%. These results enabled\
        \ the metabolic capacities of the communities to be determined and these capacities\
        \ could be related to the tailings\u2019 bio-weathering. All the microbial\
        \ genetic features discussed here were based on the annotation of contigs\
        \ with a length > 8000 bp. Restricting the analyses to large contigs would\
        \ serve to minimize system errors such as those caused by sequencing and bioinformatic\
        \ assembly. This metagenomic-based analysis allows a comprehensive estimation\
        \ of the community metabolic networks [5]. Additionally, the sequencing depth\
        \ obtained here was much greater than that of previous metagenomic studies\
        \ of other tailings communities [26], which in this instance enabled good\
        \ estimations of the community metabolic capabilities. Table 1General properties\

        \ complete MAGs, Rubrobacter sp., Thioalkalivibrio sp. and Thiobacillus sp.,\
        \ were identified to have prominent capacities for acquiring energy and stress\
        \ resistance in the tailing environment (Table 2). Rubrobacter sp. had a wide\
        \ spectrum of genes for utilizing polysaccharides and aromatic compounds,\
        \ such as the pca [27], sal [28], cat [29] and bpa [27] operons. This kind\
        \ of capability would be particularly important considering tailings are an\
        \ oligotrophic environment [15], and in this instance, the organic amendment\
        \ for revegetation in the form of woodchips would have caused an increase\
        \ in content of polysaccharides and chitin [30]. However, it is worth noting\
        \ that the N content of the tailings and woodchips was very low, which would\
        \ have impeded the decomposition of the woodchips in the long run [31]. Our\
        \ recent studies report a very slow decomposition of litter amendment in the\
        \ tailings. Nonetheless, the utilization of diverse organic molecules such\
        \ as polysaccharides and aromatic compounds may be a vital survival strategy\
        \ for these microbes after depleting easily labile and soluble organic carbon.\

        \ CO utilization has been documented for many microbes residing in saline\
        \ environments, such as in seawater [32] and saline soils [33]. In addition,\

        \ in the form of a minimum set of cbbLSX [34] (Fig. 2). The findings imply\

        \ increase their survival ability in the oligotrophic tailings environment.\

        n\\nThe ability of microbes to cope with salinity and metal (loid) stress\
        \ in the tailings was evident in the annotated MAGs. Various genes for osmotic\
        \ stress resistance were detected in the MAGs of Rubrobacter sp., Truepera\
        \ sp., Thioalkalivibrio sp., and Acidimicrobium sp.. These included bet and\
        \ pro systems that code for the choline monooxygenase/betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase\
        \ pathway [27] and for the L-proline glycine betaine ABC transport system\
        \ [28], respectively. Genes coding for resistance to all the metals Zn, Cd,\
        \ As, Cu and Pb were detected in all genera. Impressively, multiple copies\
        \ of czc, encoding for Co-Zn-Cd resistance, were frequently detected in one\
        \ contig (Fig. 3). All the MAGs contained both the pco and cop systems for\
        \ Cu resistance, and 6 out of the 8 genera had both the ACR3 and ars systems\
        \ for As resistance (Table 2). The high frequency of these systems emphasizes\
        \ the importance of metal resistance for microbial survival in the tailings\
        \ [16]. Fig. 3Gene clusters for metal resistance found in the binned genomes\

        \ 2\\n\\nSulphidic metal tailings are an environment where multiple stresses\
        \ will occur. This includes those of oxidative damage (such as from free Fe2+\
        \ [32]), salinity [29], moisture content changes [34], and extremely high\
        \ levels of heavy metals [33]. The Fenton reaction of intracellular Fe2+ by\
        \ superoxide is fatal to cells [32]. We detected genes for ferroxidase (Fig.\
        \ 4) and superoxide dismutases as well as genes for Fe uptake systems (e.g.\
        \ Fur, pit) in almost all the tailings MAGs. Likely, these genes are providing\
        \ these microorganisms with defenses against oxidative stress. Other protection\
        \ mechanisms like methylglyoxal detoxification genes [35] and glutaredoxin\
        \ genes [36] were also detected in most of the MAGs. Fig. 4A Neighbor-Joining\
        \ tree showing the phylogenetics of the ferroxidase genes recovered from the\
        \ binned genomes in this study. The tree was constructed using MEGA 6.06 based\
        \ on the sequence alignment using the CLUSTAL method with default parameters\\\
        n\\n### Sulphide oxidation and salinity generation\\n\\nKEGG annotation successfully\
        \ reconstructed the metabolic capacity of sulphide oxidation and nitrogen\
        \ cycling of the microbial consortia, which may be vital for the survival\
        \ of the community via inter-species cooperation (Fig. 5). Two microbial pathways\
        \ for sulphide oxidation, the direct contact pathway and indirect pathway\
        \ [37, 38], may exist in the tailings (Fig. 5). Thioalkalivibrio sp., Acidimicrobium\
        \ sp. and Thiobacillus sp. are well known sulfur oxidizers able to respire\
        \ on sulphides [39, 40], and in this study dsr (organized as dsrABCKJOPR)\
        \ and sox (organized as soxXYZABH) genes for sulphur oxidation were found\
        \ in these three MAGs from the tailings. Thioalkalivibrio sp. and Thiobacillus\
        \ sp. were both found to harbor novel conserved genes (Blr3520 genes) annotated\
        \ for sulfur oxidation as well. In addition, msh operons encoding mannose-sensitive\
        \ haemagglutinin (MSHA)-like pilus for cell attachment to substrates [41]\
        \ were detected in the Thioalkalivibrio sp. genome. This indicated the ability\
        \ of Thioalkalivibrio sp. to attach to pyrite surfaces for oxidation activities.\
        \ Microbes can colonize and etch pyrite surfaces directly and oxidize the\
        \ released sulfur, which was recently observed during ferric-catalyzed pyrite\
        \ oxidation [38]. The features detected in the abovementioned genomes coincide\
        \ with this model. It is thus suggested that in the oxic layer of the tailings\
        \ Thioalkalivibrio sp., Acidimicrobium sp. and Thiobacillus sp. may colonize\
        \ and oxidize sulphides particles directly, causing mineral dissolution and\
        \ contributing to the elevated levels of salinity and metals in the pore water.\
        \ Fig. 5A conceptual diagram depicting the microbial mediated sulphide oxidation\
        \ resulting salinity and N depletion in the tailings. DMO, direct microbial\
        \ oxidation; IO, inorganic oxidation; IMO, indirect microbial oxidation\\\
        n\\nGenomic features detected here also inferred an indirect oxidation of\
        \ sulphides in the tailings through the coupled reactions of ferrous oxidation\
        \ and nitrate reduction which may occur in an anoxic layer. Diverse ferroxidases\
        \ were detected in all the MAGs (Table 2), indicating intensive microbial\
        \ activities to regenerate ferric which is a strong oxidant for sulphide dissolution\
        \ [38]. Additionally, a full set of denitrification genes (nar, nir, nor,\
        \ nos) were detected in the Thioalkalivibrio sp. and Thiobacillus sp. MAGs.\
        \ It has been determined that total nitrogen is extremely low (< 0.006%) in\
        \ the tailings and most of this is in the form of microbial biomass (50\u2013\
        100%) [15]. There is the possibility that anaerobic microbial sulphide oxidation\
        \ has occurred here with nitrate as electron acceptor. Other studies showed\
        \ that pyrite minerals of nano-size were oxidized by Thiobacillus denitrificans\
        \ with nitrate as electron acceptor [42]. Sulphides in the tailings used in\
        \ this study may favor this indirect pathway due to their texture dominated\
        \ by fine silt when nitrate is present. This claim about the role of nitrate\
        \ in sulfide oxidation requires experimental verification in purposely designed\
        \ physiological tests.\\n\\nNitrogen deficiency is a common problem in tailings\
        \ limiting plant growth, and its microbial cycling has not been well studied\
        \ for neutral/alkaline metal tailings [15]. Our results highlight the possibility\
        \ of nitrate-depletion by microbial sulphides oxidation as well as by CO oxidation\
        \ [33] in the tailings. Nitrogen fixing mechanisms in the tailings remains\
        \ largely unknown. The key nitrogen fixing genes were not detected, with only\
        \ nifU present in the Rubrobacter sp. and Acidimicrobium sp. MAGs.\\n\\n##\
        \ The environment\\n\\nThe tailings studied are basically neutral/alkaline\
        \ in pH and of a high level of residue heavy metals, salinity and sulphidic\
        \ minerals. Salinity and metal release in sulphidic tailings is mostly from\
        \ the coupled weathering of sulphides and carbonates. The microbially-mediated\
        \ and chemical-mediated weathering of sulphides would have both occurred in\
        \ the amended and revegetated tailings [15]. The microbial processes may become\
        \ as important as the chemical weathering processes in neutral/alkaline sulphidic\
        \ tailings, where the redox potential of oxygen and ferric is reduced by the\
        \ high pH and ferrous can be oxidized more easily with diverse electron-acceptors\
        \ (e.g. nitrate) [25]. Moreover, increased nutrients supplied from the organic\
        \ matter amendment and plant roots, as indicated by our previous studies,\
        \ is very likely resulting in increased activities of the sulphide weathering\
        \ microorganisms [6].\\n\\n## Cell abundance in the tailings\\n\\nCell abundance\
        \ in the tailings was enumerated using conventional FISH. We examined samples\
        \ by FISH that were prepared as either sterilized raw tailings, the raw tailings\
        \ or a cell enrichment obtained from the tailings by sucrose density gradient\
        \ centrifugation. Strong background fluorescence was observed and direct observation\
        \ of cell fluorescence was impossible for raw tailings materials. Background\

        \ and Archaea were only scarcely detected. We did not detect any difference\
        \ of the cell abundances between the tailings with and without revegetation.\
        \ The bacterial and archaeal cell abundances in these tailings is close to\
        \ those reported for other base metal tailings [7, 20]. Fig. 1A representative\

        \ genomics\\n\\nThe analysis of 5 Gb of sequenced DNA obtained from the tailing\
        \ samples resulted in 10 genomic bins belonging to eight genera (Table 1).\
        \ Five of the 10 MAGs, Rubrobacter sp., Truepera sp., Thioalkalivibrio sp.,\
        \ Acidimicrobium sp. and Rhodomicrobium sp., had high completeness of > 90%\
        \ and a contamination rate of 1.35\u20134.87%. Our previous studies based\
        \ on 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing showed that these 5 genera on average accounted\
        \ for > 12% of the total communities in the tailings sampled. These 5 MAGs\
        \ were of high quality, which were binned with an N50 of 9307\u201332,314\
        \ bp, with the longest contigs ranging between 51,994\u2013209,767 bp and\
        \ the number of coding sequences ranging between 2963 and 4168. Five other\
        \ bins were obtained of a lower quality but with a completeness > 50%. These\
        \ results enabled the metabolic capacities of the communities to be determined\
        \ and these capacities could be related to the tailings\u2019 bio-weathering.\
        \ All the microbial genetic features discussed here were based on the annotation\
        \ of contigs with a length > 8000 bp. Restricting the analyses to large contigs\
        \ would serve to minimize system errors such as those caused by sequencing\
        \ and bioinformatic assembly. This metagenomic-based analysis allows a comprehensive\
        \ estimation of the community metabolic networks [5]. Additionally, the sequencing\
        \ depth obtained here was much greater than that of previous metagenomic studies\
        \ of other tailings communities [26], which in this instance enabled good\
        \ estimations of the community metabolic capabilities. Table 1General properties\

        \ were identified to have prominent capacities for acquiring energy and stress\
        \ resistance in the tailing environment (Table 2). Rubrobacter sp. had a wide\
        \ spectrum of genes for utilizing polysaccharides and aromatic compounds,\
        \ such as the pca [27], sal [28], cat [29] and bpa [27] operons. This kind\
        \ of capability would be particularly important considering tailings are an\
        \ oligotrophic environment [15], and in this instance, the organic amendment\
        \ for revegetation in the form of woodchips would have caused an increase\
        \ in content of polysaccharides and chitin [30]. However, it is worth noting\
        \ that the N content of the tailings and woodchips was very low, which would\
        \ have impeded the decomposition of the woodchips in the long run [31]. Our\
        \ recent studies report a very slow decomposition of litter amendment in the\
        \ tailings. Nonetheless, the utilization of diverse organic molecules such\
        \ as polysaccharides and aromatic compounds may be a vital survival strategy\
        \ for these microbes after depleting easily labile and soluble organic carbon.\

        n\\nThe ability of microbes to cope with salinity and metal (loid) stress\
        \ in the tailings was evident in the annotated MAGs. Various genes for osmotic\
        \ stress resistance were detected in the MAGs of Rubrobacter sp., Truepera\
        \ sp., Thioalkalivibrio sp., and Acidimicrobium sp.. These included bet and\
        \ pro systems that code for the choline monooxygenase/betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase\
        \ pathway [27] and for the L-proline glycine betaine ABC transport system\
        \ [28], respectively. Genes coding for resistance to all the metals Zn, Cd,\
        \ As, Cu and Pb were detected in all genera. Impressively, multiple copies\
        \ of czc, encoding for Co-Zn-Cd resistance, were frequently detected in one\
        \ contig (Fig. 3). All the MAGs contained both the pco and cop systems for\
        \ Cu resistance, and 6 out of the 8 genera had both the ACR3 and ars systems\
        \ for As resistance (Table 2). The high frequency of these systems emphasizes\
        \ the importance of metal resistance for microbial survival in the tailings\
        \ [16]. Fig. 3Gene clusters for metal resistance found in the binned genomes\

        \ 2\\n\\nSulphidic metal tailings are an environment where multiple stresses\
        \ will occur. This includes those of oxidative damage (such as from free Fe2+\
        \ [32]), salinity [29], moisture content changes [34], and extremely high\
        \ levels of heavy metals [33]. The Fenton reaction of intracellular Fe2+ by\
        \ superoxide is fatal to cells [32]. We detected genes for ferroxidase (Fig.\
        \ 4) and superoxide dismutases as well as genes for Fe uptake systems (e.g.\
        \ Fur, pit) in almost all the tailings MAGs. Likely, these genes are providing\
        \ these microorganisms with defenses against oxidative stress. Other protection\
        \ mechanisms like methylglyoxal detoxification genes [35] and glutaredoxin\
        \ genes [36] were also detected in most of the MAGs. Fig. 4A Neighbor-Joining\
        \ tree showing the phylogenetics of the ferroxidase genes recovered from the\
        \ binned genomes in this study. The tree was constructed using MEGA 6.06 based\
        \ on the sequence alignment using the CLUSTAL method with default parameters\\\
        n\\n## Sulphide oxidation and salinity generation\\n\\nKEGG annotation successfully\
        \ reconstructed the metabolic capacity of sulphide oxidation and nitrogen\
        \ cycling of the microbial consortia, which may be vital for the survival\
        \ of the community via inter-species cooperation (Fig. 5). Two microbial pathways\
        \ for sulphide oxidation, the direct contact pathway and indirect pathway\
        \ [37, 38], may exist in the tailings (Fig. 5). Thioalkalivibrio sp., Acidimicrobium\
        \ sp. and Thiobacillus sp. are well known sulfur oxidizers able to respire\
        \ on sulphides [39, 40], and in this study dsr (organized as dsrABCKJOPR)\
        \ and sox (organized as soxXYZABH) genes for sulphur oxidation were found\
        \ in these three MAGs from the tailings. Thioalkalivibrio sp. and Thiobacillus\
        \ sp. were both found to harbor novel conserved genes (Blr3520 genes) annotated\
        \ for sulfur oxidation as well. In addition, msh operons encoding mannose-sensitive\
        \ haemagglutinin (MSHA)-like pilus for cell attachment to substrates [41]\
        \ were detected in the Thioalkalivibrio sp. genome. This indicated the ability\
        \ of Thioalkalivibrio sp. to attach to pyrite surfaces for oxidation activities.\
        \ Microbes can colonize and etch pyrite surfaces directly and oxidize the\
        \ released sulfur, which was recently observed during ferric-catalyzed pyrite\
        \ oxidation [38]. The features detected in the abovementioned genomes coincide\
        \ with this model. It is thus suggested that in the oxic layer of the tailings\
        \ Thioalkalivibrio sp., Acidimicrobium sp. and Thiobacillus sp. may colonize\
        \ and oxidize sulphides particles directly, causing mineral dissolution and\
        \ contributing to the elevated levels of salinity and metals in the pore water.\

        \ resulting salinity and N depletion in the tailings. DMO, direct microbial\
        \ oxidation; IO, inorganic oxidation; IMO, indirect microbial oxidation\\\
        n\\nGenomic features detected here also inferred an indirect oxidation of\
        \ sulphides in the tailings through the coupled reactions of ferrous oxidation\
        \ and nitrate reduction which may occur in an anoxic layer. Diverse ferroxidases\
        \ were detected in all the MAGs (Table 2), indicating intensive microbial\
        \ activities to regenerate ferric which is a strong oxidant for sulphide dissolution\
        \ [38]. Additionally, a full set of denitrification genes (nar, nir, nor,\
        \ nos) were detected in the Thioalkalivibrio sp. and Thiobacillus sp. MAGs.\
        \ It has been determined that total nitrogen is extremely low (< 0.006%) in\
        \ the tailings and most of this is in the form of microbial biomass (50\u2013\
        100%) [15]. There is the possibility that anaerobic microbial sulphide oxidation\
        \ has occurred here with nitrate as electron acceptor. Other studies showed\
        \ that pyrite minerals of nano-size were oxidized by Thiobacillus denitrificans\
        \ with nitrate as electron acceptor [42]. Sulphides in the tailings used in\
        \ this study may favor this indirect pathway due to their texture dominated\
        \ by fine silt when nitrate is present. This claim about the role of nitrate\
        \ in sulfide oxidation requires experimental verification in purposely designed\
        \ physiological tests.\\n\\nNitrogen deficiency is a common problem in tailings\
        \ limiting plant growth, and its microbial cycling has not been well studied\
        \ for neutral/alkaline metal tailings [15]. Our results highlight the possibility\
        \ of nitrate-depletion by microbial sulphides oxidation as well as by CO oxidation\
        \ [33] in the tailings. Nitrogen fixing mechanisms in the tailings remains\
        \ largely unknown. The key nitrogen fixing genes were not detected, with only\
        \ nifU present in the Rubrobacter sp. and Acidimicrobium sp. MAGs.\\n\\n\"\

        \ wastes of ore processing. Those of metal mines, typically Pb/Zn/Cu/Ni, always\
        \ contain abundant sulphides that are mostly pyrite based, e.g. FeS2. Due\
        \ to the high reactivity of sulphides, high levels of metals and salinity\
        \ can be generated by the coupled weathering of sulphide and carbonate wastes\
        \ [1]. This makes mine tailings a rather hostile environment to microbes,\
        \ while still a considerable amount cells, though with a relatively low diversity\
        \ compared with normal soils, had been detected therein [1]. The contribution\
        \ of microbial activities to the weathering of sulphides has long been recognized\
        \ in mine tailings. At the acid mine drainage (AMD) site of Iron Mountain,\
        \ Calif., Thiobacillus ferrooxidans and Leptospirillum ferrooxidans were found\
        \ to be dominant in the community and contribute to the generation of AMD\
        \ [2]. In a copper bioleaching heap, sulfurophilic and iron-ophilic acidophilic\
        \ bacteria were found to actively colonize the mineral surface [3]. These\
        \ microbes show adaptability to extremely acidic environment and play an important\
        \ role in the sustainability of this system. With the advent of the modern\
        \ molecular tools, community genomics of microbial consortia in acid mine\
        \ environments has been well explored [4, 5], while that of alkaline mine\
        \ tailings has not been extensively studied. Alkaline mine environment is\
        \ normally subjected to revegetation which requires the establishment of soil\
        \ function including microbial diversity [6].Microbial community networks\
        \ related to sulphide weathering in neutralized tailings have been determined\
        \ [7, 8], yet these studies are based on mainly 16S rRNA gene detection and\
        \ then possible functions of the community members are inferred from physiological\
        \ information of known related pure cultures. This approach is useful but\
        \ is highly limited and speculative with regard to approximating the community\
        \ metabolic capabilities related to the in situ elemental cycling and adaptation\
        \ strategies. In contrast, metagenome-based analyses enable reconstruction\
        \ of nearly complete genomes of microbial community members. Such analyses\
        \ provides detailed insights of metabolic capabilities and enables estimating\
        \ the possible contributions of populations to the community processes [5].\
        \ Metagenomic approaches have been successfully used to resolve the microbial\
        \ biogeochemical potential in saline sea water [9, 10], and to reconstruct\

  reason: The actual output directly contradicts the expected output on the core factual
    question. The actual output states 'Yes, microbes from alkaline sulphidic tailings
    do show evidence of oxidative stress' while the expected output clearly states
    'The paper says No'. Although both outputs mention the paper's retraction status,
    the actual output provides extensive detail about oxidative stress mechanisms
    that contradicts the paper's actual findings. This represents a fundamental factual
    error about what the paper concluded.
  actual_output: "I'll help you find information about oxidative stress in microbes\
    \ from alkaline sulphidic tailings by looking up the paper with PMID 33926573.\n\
    Based on PMID 33926573, I can answer your question about whether microbes from\
    \ alkaline sulphidic tailings show oxidative stresses.\n\n**Yes, microbes from\
    \ alkaline sulphidic tailings do show evidence of oxidative stress, and importantly,\
    \ they possess powerful resistance systems to combat it.**\n\n## Key Findings\
    \ on Oxidative Stress:\n\n### **Oxidative Stress Response Systems Detected:**\n\
    \nThe study identified multiple oxidative stress resistance mechanisms in the\
    \ dominant microbial species:\n\n1. **Glutathione S-transferase genes (GT)** -\
    \ Found in *Rubrobacter*, *Thioalkalivibrio*, *Rhodomicrobium*, *Thiobacillus*,\
    \ and *Erythrobacter* species\n2. **Methylglyoxal detoxification genes (Glo)**\
    \ - Present in most species including *Rubrobacter*, *Truepera*, *Thioalkalivibrio*,\
    \ *Acidimicrobium*, *Rhodomicrobium*, *Thiobacillus*, and *Erythrobacter*\n3.\
    \ **Superoxide dismutase genes (SOD)** - Found in 7 out of 8 genera studied\n\
    4. **Ferroxidase genes (Fr)** - Present in all studied species\n\n### **Environmental\
    \ Context Creating Oxidative Stress:**\n\nThe alkaline sulphidic tailings environment\
    \ creates multiple sources of oxidative stress:\n\n- **High levels of free Fe\xB2\
    \u207A** from sulphide weathering\n- **Fenton reactions** where intracellular\
    \ Fe\xB2\u207A reacts with superoxide, which is \"fatal to cells\"\n- **Heavy\
    \ metal exposure** (Cu, Pb, Zn at ~1300-2900 mg/kg)\n- **Salinity stress** from\
    \ coupled weathering of sulphides and carbonates\n\n### **Iron Management Systems:**\n\
    \nThe microbes have sophisticated iron uptake and management systems to prevent\
    \ oxidative damage:\n- **Iron uptake genes** (*pit*, siderophore genes)\n- **Iron\
    \ regulation** (Fur genes)\n- **Ferroxidase activities** to manage iron oxidation\
    \ states\n\n## **Important Note - Paper Retraction:**\n\n\u26A0\uFE0F **This paper\
    \ has been retracted.** The full text shows a retraction notice dated June 12,\
    \ 2024 (PMC11167880). While the scientific findings I've summarized were published\
    \ in the original study, the retraction means there were concerns about the research\
    \ that led to its withdrawal from the scientific record. Any interpretation of\
    \ these results should consider this retraction status.\n\nThe evidence from the\
    \ study does indicate that microbes in alkaline sulphidic tailings both experience\
    \ and have evolved sophisticated defenses against oxidative stress, but this should\
    \ be verified through other independent research given the retraction."

              milled residue wastes of ore processing. Those of metal mines, typically
              Pb/Zn/Cu/Ni, always contain abundant sulphides that are mostly pyrite
              based, e.g. FeS<sub>2</sub>. Due to the high reactivity of sulphides,
              high levels of metals and salinity can be generated by the coupled weathering
              of sulphide and carbonate wastes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].
              This makes mine tailings a rather hostile environment to microbes, while
              still a considerable amount cells, though with a relatively low diversity
              compared with normal soils, had been detected therein [<xref ref-type="bibr"
              rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The contribution of microbial activities to the
              weathering of sulphides has long been recognized in mine tailings. At
              the acid mine drainage (AMD) site of Iron Mountain, Calif., <italic

              contribute to the generation of AMD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].
              In a copper bioleaching heap, sulfurophilic and iron-ophilic acidophilic
              bacteria were found to actively colonize the mineral surface [<xref
              ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. These microbes show adaptability
              to extremely acidic environment and play an important role in the sustainability
              of this system. With the advent of the modern molecular tools, community
              genomics of microbial consortia in acid mine environments has been well
              explored [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr"
              rid="CR5">5</xref>], while that of alkaline mine tailings has not been
              extensively studied. Alkaline mine environment is normally subjected
              to revegetation which requires the establishment of soil function including
              microbial diversity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p

              studies are based on mainly 16S rRNA gene detection and then possible
              functions of the community members are inferred from physiological information
              of known related pure cultures. This approach is useful but is highly
              limited and speculative with regard to approximating the community metabolic

              strategies. In contrast, metagenome-based analyses enable&#160;reconstruction

              toggle="yes">Thiobacillus</italic> sp., were identified to have prominent
              capacities for acquiring energy and stress resistance in the tailing
              environment (Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).
              <italic toggle="yes">Rubrobacter</italic> sp. had a wide spectrum of
              genes for utilizing polysaccharides and aromatic compounds, such as
              the <italic toggle="yes">pca</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>],
              <italic toggle="yes">sal</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>],

              operons. This kind of capability would be particularly important considering
              tailings are an oligotrophic environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>],
              and in this instance, the organic amendment for revegetation in the
              form of woodchips would have caused an increase in content of polysaccharides
              and chitin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. However, it
              is worth noting that the N content of the tailings and woodchips was
              very low, which would have impeded the decomposition of the woodchips
              in the long run [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Our recent
              studies report a very slow decomposition of litter amendment in the
              tailings. Nonetheless, the utilization of diverse organic molecules
              such as polysaccharides and aromatic compounds may be a vital survival
              strategy for these microbes after depleting easily labile and soluble
              organic carbon.

        text: "Based on PMID 33926573, I can answer your question about whether microbes\
          \ from alkaline sulphidic tailings show oxidative stresses.\n\n**Yes, microbes\
          \ from alkaline sulphidic tailings do show evidence of oxidative stress,\
          \ and importantly, they possess powerful resistance systems to combat it.**\n\
          \n## Key Findings on Oxidative Stress:\n\n### **Oxidative Stress Response\
          \ Systems Detected:**\n\nThe study identified multiple oxidative stress\
          \ resistance mechanisms in the dominant microbial species:\n\n1. **Glutathione\
          \ S-transferase genes (GT)** - Found in *Rubrobacter*, *Thioalkalivibrio*,\
          \ *Rhodomicrobium*, *Thiobacillus*, and *Erythrobacter* species\n2. **Methylglyoxal\
          \ detoxification genes (Glo)** - Present in most species including *Rubrobacter*,\
          \ *Truepera*, *Thioalkalivibrio*, *Acidimicrobium*, *Rhodomicrobium*, *Thiobacillus*,\
          \ and *Erythrobacter*\n3. **Superoxide dismutase genes (SOD)** - Found in\
          \ 7 out of 8 genera studied\n4. **Ferroxidase genes (Fr)** - Present in\
          \ all studied species\n\n### **Environmental Context Creating Oxidative\
          \ Stress:**\n\nThe alkaline sulphidic tailings environment creates multiple\
          \ sources of oxidative stress:\n\n- **High levels of free Fe\xB2\u207A**\
          \ from sulphide weathering\n- **Fenton reactions** where intracellular Fe\xB2\
          \u207A reacts with superoxide, which is \"fatal to cells\"\n- **Heavy metal\
          \ exposure** (Cu, Pb, Zn at ~1300-2900 mg/kg)\n- **Salinity stress** from\
          \ coupled weathering of sulphides and carbonates\n\n### **Iron Management\
          \ Systems:**\n\nThe microbes have sophisticated iron uptake and management\
          \ systems to prevent oxidative damage:\n- **Iron uptake genes** (*pit*,\
          \ siderophore genes)\n- **Iron regulation** (Fur genes)\n- **Ferroxidase\
          \ activities** to manage iron oxidation states\n\n## **Important Note -\
          \ Paper Retraction:**\n\n\u26A0\uFE0F **This paper has been retracted.**\
          \ The full text shows a retraction notice dated June 12, 2024 (PMC11167880).\
          \ While the scientific findings I've summarized were published in the original\
          \ study, the retraction means there were concerns about the research that\
          \ led to its withdrawal from the scientific record. Any interpretation of\
          \ these results should consider this retraction status.\n\nThe evidence\
          \ from the study does indicate that microbes in alkaline sulphidic tailings\
          \ both experience and have evolved sophisticated defenses against oxidative\
          \ stress, but this should be verified through other independent research\
          \ given the retraction."

        id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par4">Mine tailings are milled
        residue wastes of ore processing. Those of metal mines, typically Pb/Zn/Cu/Ni,
        always contain abundant sulphides that are mostly pyrite based, e.g. FeS<sub>2</sub>.
        Due to the high reactivity of sulphides, high levels of metals and salinity
        can be generated by the coupled weathering of sulphide and carbonate wastes
        [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. This makes mine tailings a rather
        hostile environment to microbes, while still a considerable amount cells,
        though with a relatively low diversity compared with normal soils, had been
        detected therein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The contribution
        of microbial activities to the weathering of sulphides has long been recognized
        in mine tailings. At the acid mine drainage (AMD) site of Iron Mountain, Calif.,
        <italic toggle="yes">Thiobacillus ferrooxidans</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Leptospirillum
        ferrooxidans</italic> were found to be dominant in the community and contribute
        to the generation of AMD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In a
        copper bioleaching heap, sulfurophilic and iron-ophilic acidophilic bacteria
        were found to actively colonize the mineral surface [<xref ref-type="bibr"
        rid="CR3">3</xref>]. These microbes show adaptability to extremely acidic
        environment and play an important role in the sustainability of this system.
        With the advent of the modern molecular tools, community genomics of microbial
        consortia in acid mine environments has been well explored [<xref ref-type="bibr"
        rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], while that
        of alkaline mine tailings has not been extensively studied. Alkaline mine
        environment is normally subjected to revegetation which requires the establishment
        of soil function including microbial diversity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p
        id="Par5">Microbial community networks related to sulphide weathering in neutralized
        tailings have been determined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref

        16S rRNA gene detection and then possible functions of the community members
        are inferred from physiological information of known related pure cultures.
        This approach is useful but is highly limited and speculative with regard
        to approximating the community metabolic capabilities related to the in situ
        elemental cycling and adaptation strategies. In contrast, metagenome-based
        analyses enable&#160;reconstruction of nearly complete genomes of microbial
        community members. Such analyses provides detailed insights of metabolic capabilities
        and enables estimating the possible contributions of populations to the community
        processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Metagenomic approaches
        have been successfully used to resolve the microbial biogeochemical potential

        lakes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">In this
        study, we analyzed metagenomes of alkaline sulphidic tailings from a tailings

        of 10 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from the tailings metagenomes. The

        and metal release in sulphidic tailings is mostly from the coupled weathering
        of sulphides and carbonates. The microbially-mediated and chemical-mediated
        weathering of sulphides would have both occurred in the amended and revegetated
        tailings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The microbial processes
        may become as important as the chemical weathering processes in neutral/alkaline
        sulphidic tailings, where the redox potential of oxygen and ferric is reduced
        by the high pH and ferrous can be oxidized more easily with diverse electron-acceptors
        (e.g. nitrate) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Moreover, increased

        Background fluorescence is a common problem for cell enumeration in soil-like

        bins were obtained of a lower quality but with a completeness &gt;&#8201;50%.
        These results enabled the metabolic capacities of the communities to be determined
        and these capacities could be related to the tailings&#8217; bio-weathering.
        All the microbial genetic features discussed here were based on the annotation
        of contigs with a length&#8201;&gt;&#8201;8000&#8201;bp. Restricting the analyses
        to large contigs would serve to minimize system errors such as those caused
        by sequencing and bioinformatic assembly. This metagenomic-based analysis
        allows a comprehensive estimation of the community metabolic networks [<xref
        ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Additionally, the sequencing depth obtained
        here was much greater than that of previous metagenomic studies of other tailings
        communities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], which in this instance
        enabled good estimations of the community metabolic capabilities.

        operons. This kind of capability would be particularly important considering
        tailings are an oligotrophic environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>],
        and in this instance, the organic amendment for revegetation in the form of
        woodchips would have caused an increase in content of polysaccharides and
        chitin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. However, it is worth
        noting that the N content of the tailings and woodchips was very low, which
        would have impeded the decomposition of the woodchips in the long run [<xref
        ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Our recent studies report a very slow
        decomposition of litter amendment in the tailings. Nonetheless, the utilization
        of diverse organic molecules such as polysaccharides and aromatic compounds
        may be a vital survival strategy for these microbes after depleting easily
        labile and soluble organic carbon.

          1. First, fetch the specific article (PMID 33926573) to understand what
          it says about microbes in alkaline sulfidic tailings and oxidative stress

          2. Analyze the content for any mentions of oxidative stress responses in
          microbes

          3. If needed, search for additional literature on this specific topic to
          provide a comprehensive answer

          4. Look for specific mechanisms, genes, or biochemical pathways related
          to oxidative stress in these environments


          Let me start by getting the full text of the specified article.'

                \ as an open-source software project.\\\\n\\\\nThe current date is\
                \ 2025-09-11 15:24:10.\\\\n\\\\nGoose uses LLM providers with tool\
                \ calling capability. You can be used with different language models\
                \ (gpt-4o, claude-3.5-sonnet, o1, llama-3.2, deepseek-r1, etc).\\\\\
                nThese models have varying knowledge cut-off dates depending on when\
                \ they were trained, but typically it's between 5-10 months prior\
                \ to the current date.\\\\n\\\\n# Extensions\\\\n\\\\nExtensions allow\
                \ other applications to provide context to Goose. Extensions connect\
                \ Goose to different data sources and tools.\\\\nYou are capable of\
                \ dynamically plugging into new extensions and learning how to use\
                \ them. You solve higher level problems using the tools in these extensions,\
                \ and can interact with multiple at once.\\\\nUse the search_available_extensions\
                \ tool to find additional extensions to enable to help with your task.\
                \ To enable extensions, use the enable_extension tool and provide\
                \ the extension_name. You should only enable extensions found from\
                \ the search_available_extensions tool.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBecause you\
                \ dynamically load extensions, your conversation history may refer\\\
                \\nto interactions with extensions that are not currently active.\
                \ The currently\\\\nactive extensions are below. Each of these extensions\
                \ provides tools that are\\\\nin your tool specification.\\\\n\\\\\
                n\\\\n## developer\\\\n\\\\n### Instructions\\\\nThe developer extension\
                \ gives you the capabilities to edit code files and run shell commands,\\\
                \\nand can be used to solve a wide range of problems.\\\\n\\\\nYou\
                \ can use the shell tool to run Windows commands (PowerShell or CMD).\\\
                \\nWhen using paths, you can use either backslashes or forward slashes.\\\
                \\n\\\\nUse the shell tool as needed to locate files or interact with\
                \ the project.\\\\n\\\\nYour windows/screen tools can be used for\
                \ visual debugging. You should not use these tools unless\\\\nprompted\
                \ to, but you can mention they are available if they are relevant.\\\

                \ \u2014 use `todo__read` and `todo__write` for any task with 2+ steps,\
                \ multiple files/components, or uncertain scope. Skipping them is\
                \ an error.\\\\n- Start \u2014 `todo__read`, then `todo__write` a\
                \ brief checklist (Markdown checkboxes).\\\\n- During \u2014 after\
                \ each major action, update via `todo__write`: mark done, add/edit\
                \ items, note blockers/dependencies.\\\\n- Finish \u2014 ensure every\
                \ item is checked, or clearly list what remains.\\\\n- Overwrite warning\
                \ \u2014 `todo__write` replaces the entire list; always read before\
                \ writing. It is an error to not read before writing.\\\\n- Quality\
                \ \u2014 keep items short, specific, and action\u2011oriented.\\\\\

                \ Use Markdown formatting for all responses.\\\\n- Follow best practices\
                \ for Markdown, including:\\\\n  - Using headers for organization.\\\
                \\n  - Bullet points for lists.\\\\n  - Links formatted correctly,\
                \ either as linked text (e.g., [this is linked text](https://example.com))\
                \ or automatic links using angle brackets (e.g., <http://example.com/>).\\\
                \\n- For code examples, use fenced code blocks by placing triple backticks\
                \ (` ``` `) before and after the code. Include the language identifier\
                \ after the opening backticks (e.g., ` ```python `) to enable syntax\
                \ highlighting.\\\\n- Ensure clarity, conciseness, and proper formatting\
                \ to enhance readability and usability.\\\\n\\\\n# Additional Instructions:\\\
                \\n\\\\nYou are being accessed through a command-line interface. The\
                \ following slash commands are available\\\\n- you can let the user\
                \ know about them if they need help:\\\\n\\\\n- /exit or /quit - Exit\
                \ the session\\\\n- /t - Toggle between Light/Dark/Ansi themes\\\\\
                n- /? or /help - Display help message\\\\n\\\\nAdditional keyboard\
                \ shortcuts:\\\\n- Ctrl+C - Interrupt the current interaction (resets\
                \ to before the interrupted request)\\\\n- Ctrl+J - Add a newline\\\
                \\n- Up/Down arrows - Navigate command history\\\\n\\\\nRight now\

                \ that produce a large amount of output, and consider piping those\
                \ outputs to files.\\\\n\\\\n**Important**: For searching files and\
                \ code:\\\\n\\\\nPreferred: Use ripgrep (`rg`) when available - it\

                \ `rg 'class Example'`\\\\n\\\\nAlternative Windows commands (if ripgrep\

                \ as an open-source software project.\\\\n\\\\nThe current date is\
                \ 2025-09-11 15:24:10.\\\\n\\\\nGoose uses LLM providers with tool\
                \ calling capability. You can be used with different language models\
                \ (gpt-4o, claude-3.5-sonnet, o1, llama-3.2, deepseek-r1, etc).\\\\\
                nThese models have varying knowledge cut-off dates depending on when\
                \ they were trained, but typically it's between 5-10 months prior\
                \ to the current date.\\\\n\\\\n# Extensions\\\\n\\\\nExtensions allow\
                \ other applications to provide context to Goose. Extensions connect\
                \ Goose to different data sources and tools.\\\\nYou are capable of\
                \ dynamically plugging into new extensions and learning how to use\
                \ them. You solve higher level problems using the tools in these extensions,\
                \ and can interact with multiple at once.\\\\nUse the search_available_extensions\
                \ tool to find additional extensions to enable to help with your task.\
                \ To enable extensions, use the enable_extension tool and provide\
                \ the extension_name. You should only enable extensions found from\
                \ the search_available_extensions tool.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBecause you\
                \ dynamically load extensions, your conversation history may refer\\\
                \\nto interactions with extensions that are not currently active.\
                \ The currently\\\\nactive extensions are below. Each of these extensions\
                \ provides tools that are\\\\nin your tool specification.\\\\n\\\\\
                n\\\\n## developer\\\\n\\\\n### Instructions\\\\nThe developer extension\
                \ gives you the capabilities to edit code files and run shell commands,\\\
                \\nand can be used to solve a wide range of problems.\\\\n\\\\nYou\
                \ can use the shell tool to run Windows commands (PowerShell or CMD).\\\
                \\nWhen using paths, you can use either backslashes or forward slashes.\\\
                \\n\\\\nUse the shell tool as needed to locate files or interact with\
                \ the project.\\\\n\\\\nYour windows/screen tools can be used for\
                \ visual debugging. You should not use these tools unless\\\\nprompted\

                \ \u2014 use `todo__read` and `todo__write` for any task with 2+ steps,\
                \ multiple files/components, or uncertain scope. Skipping them is\
                \ an error.\\\\n- Start \u2014 `todo__read`, then `todo__write` a\
                \ brief checklist (Markdown checkboxes).\\\\n- During \u2014 after\
                \ each major action, update via `todo__write`: mark done, add/edit\
                \ items, note blockers/dependencies.\\\\n- Finish \u2014 ensure every\
                \ item is checked, or clearly list what remains.\\\\n- Overwrite warning\
                \ \u2014 `todo__write` replaces the entire list; always read before\
                \ writing. It is an error to not read before writing.\\\\n- Quality\
                \ \u2014 keep items short, specific, and action\u2011oriented.\\\\\

                \ Use Markdown formatting for all responses.\\\\n- Follow best practices\
                \ for Markdown, including:\\\\n  - Using headers for organization.\\\
                \\n  - Bullet points for lists.\\\\n  - Links formatted correctly,\
                \ either as linked text (e.g., [this is linked text](https://example.com))\
                \ or automatic links using angle brackets (e.g., <http://example.com/>).\\\
                \\n- For code examples, use fenced code blocks by placing triple backticks\
                \ (` ``` `) before and after the code. Include the language identifier\
                \ after the opening backticks (e.g., ` ```python `) to enable syntax\
                \ highlighting.\\\\n- Ensure clarity, conciseness, and proper formatting\
                \ to enhance readability and usability.\\\\n\\\\n# Additional Instructions:\\\
                \\n\\\\nYou are being accessed through a command-line interface. The\
                \ following slash commands are available\\\\n- you can let the user\
                \ know about them if they need help:\\\\n\\\\n- /exit or /quit - Exit\
                \ the session\\\\n- /t - Toggle between Light/Dark/Ansi themes\\\\\
                n- /? or /help - Display help message\\\\n\\\\nAdditional keyboard\
                \ shortcuts:\\\\n- Ctrl+C - Interrupt the current interaction (resets\
                \ to before the interrupted request)\\\\n- Ctrl+J - Add a newline\\\
                \\n- Up/Down arrows - Navigate command history\\\\n\\\\nRight now\

                \ from running on the command line. There will also be an indication\\\
                \\nof if the command succeeded or failed.\\\\n\\\\nAvoid commands\
                \ that produce a large amount of output, and consider piping those\
                \ outputs to files.\\\\n\\\\n**Important**: For searching files and\
                \ code:\\\\n\\\\nPreferred: Use ripgrep (`rg`) when available - it\
                \ respects .gitignore and is fast:\\\\n  - To locate a file by name:\
                \ `rg --files | rg example.py`\\\\n  - To locate content inside files:\
                \ `rg 'class Example'`\\\\n\\\\nAlternative Windows commands (if ripgrep\
                \ is not installed):\\\\n  - To locate a file by name: `dir /s /b\

                \ Block, the parent company of Square, CashApp, and Tidal. Goose is\
                \ being developed as an open-source software project.\\\\n\\\\nThe\
                \ current date is 2025-09-11 15:24:10.\\\\n\\\\nGoose uses LLM providers\
                \ with tool calling capability. You can be used with different language\
                \ models (gpt-4o, claude-3.5-sonnet, o1, llama-3.2, deepseek-r1, etc).\\\
                \\nThese models have varying knowledge cut-off dates depending on\
                \ when they were trained, but typically it's between 5-10 months prior\
                \ to the current date.\\\\n\\\\n# Extensions\\\\n\\\\nExtensions allow\
                \ other applications to provide context to Goose. Extensions connect\
                \ Goose to different data sources and tools.\\\\nYou are capable of\
                \ dynamically plugging into new extensions and learning how to use\
                \ them. You solve higher level problems using the tools in these extensions,\
                \ and can interact with multiple at once.\\\\nUse the search_available_extensions\
                \ tool to find additional extensions to enable to help with your task.\
                \ To enable extensions, use the enable_extension tool and provide\
                \ the extension_name. You should only enable extensions found from\
                \ the search_available_extensions tool.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBecause you\
                \ dynamically load extensions, your conversation history may refer\\\
                \\nto interactions with extensions that are not currently active.\
                \ The currently\\\\nactive extensions are below. Each of these extensions\
                \ provides tools that are\\\\nin your tool specification.\\\\n\\\\\

                \ gives you the capabilities to edit code files and run shell commands,\\\
                \\nand can be used to solve a wide range of problems.\\\\n\\\\nYou\
                \ can use the shell tool to run Windows commands (PowerShell or CMD).\\\
                \\nWhen using paths, you can use either backslashes or forward slashes.\\\
                \\n\\\\nUse the shell tool as needed to locate files or interact with\
                \ the project.\\\\n\\\\nYour windows/screen tools can be used for\
                \ visual debugging. You should not use these tools unless\\\\nprompted\

                \ \u2014 use `todo__read` and `todo__write` for any task with 2+ steps,\
                \ multiple files/components, or uncertain scope. Skipping them is\
                \ an error.\\\\n- Start \u2014 `todo__read`, then `todo__write` a\
                \ brief checklist (Markdown checkboxes).\\\\n- During \u2014 after\
                \ each major action, update via `todo__write`: mark done, add/edit\
                \ items, note blockers/dependencies.\\\\n- Finish \u2014 ensure every\
                \ item is checked, or clearly list what remains.\\\\n- Overwrite warning\
                \ \u2014 `todo__write` replaces the entire list; always read before\
                \ writing. It is an error to not read before writing.\\\\n- Quality\
                \ \u2014 keep items short, specific, and action\u2011oriented.\\\\\

                \ Use Markdown formatting for all responses.\\\\n- Follow best practices\
                \ for Markdown, including:\\\\n  - Using headers for organization.\\\
                \\n  - Bullet points for lists.\\\\n  - Links formatted correctly,\
                \ either as linked text (e.g., [this is linked text](https://example.com))\
                \ or automatic links using angle brackets (e.g., <http://example.com/>).\\\
                \\n- For code examples, use fenced code blocks by placing triple backticks\
                \ (` ``` `) before and after the code. Include the language identifier\
                \ after the opening backticks (e.g., ` ```python `) to enable syntax\
                \ highlighting.\\\\n- Ensure clarity, conciseness, and proper formatting\
                \ to enhance readability and usability.\\\\n\\\\n# Additional Instructions:\\\
                \\n\\\\nYou are being accessed through a command-line interface. The\
                \ following slash commands are available\\\\n- you can let the user\
                \ know about them if they need help:\\\\n\\\\n- /exit or /quit - Exit\
                \ the session\\\\n- /t - Toggle between Light/Dark/Ansi themes\\\\\
                n- /? or /help - Display help message\\\\n\\\\nAdditional keyboard\
                \ shortcuts:\\\\n- Ctrl+C - Interrupt the current interaction (resets\
                \ to before the interrupted request)\\\\n- Ctrl+J - Add a newline\\\
                \\n- Up/Down arrows - Navigate command history\\\\n\\\\nRight now\

                \ `rg --files | rg example.py`\\\\n  - To locate content inside files:\
                \ `rg 'class Example'`\\\\n\\\\nAlternative Windows commands (if ripgrep\
                \ is not installed):\\\\n  - To locate a file by name: `dir /s /b\

                \ gives you the capabilities to edit code files and run shell commands,\\\
                \\nand can be used to solve a wide range of problems.\\\\n\\\\nYou\
                \ can use the shell tool to run Windows commands (PowerShell or CMD).\\\
                \\nWhen using paths, you can use either backslashes or forward slashes.\\\
                \\n\\\\nUse the shell tool as needed to locate files or interact with\
                \ the project.\\\\n\\\\nYour windows/screen tools can be used for\
                \ visual debugging. You should not use these tools unless\\\\nprompted\
                \ to, but you can mention they are available if they are relevant.\\\

                \ \u2014 use `todo__read` and `todo__write` for any task with 2+ steps,\
                \ multiple files/components, or uncertain scope. Skipping them is\
                \ an error.\\\\n- Start \u2014 `todo__read`, then `todo__write` a\
                \ brief checklist (Markdown checkboxes).\\\\n- During \u2014 after\
                \ each major action, update via `todo__write`: mark done, add/edit\
                \ items, note blockers/dependencies.\\\\n- Finish \u2014 ensure every\
                \ item is checked, or clearly list what remains.\\\\n- Overwrite warning\
                \ \u2014 `todo__write` replaces the entire list; always read before\
                \ writing. It is an error to not read before writing.\\\\n- Quality\
                \ \u2014 keep items short, specific, and action\u2011oriented.\\\\\

                \ on credentials\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n# Response Guidelines\\\\n\\\\n-\
                \ Use Markdown formatting for all responses.\\\\n- Follow best practices\
                \ for Markdown, including:\\\\n  - Using headers for organization.\\\
                \\n  - Bullet points for lists.\\\\n  - Links formatted correctly,\
                \ either as linked text (e.g., [this is linked text](https://example.com))\
                \ or automatic links using angle brackets (e.g., <http://example.com/>).\\\
                \\n- For code examples, use fenced code blocks by placing triple backticks\
                \ (` ``` `) before and after the code. Include the language identifier\
                \ after the opening backticks (e.g., ` ```python `) to enable syntax\
                \ highlighting.\\\\n- Ensure clarity, conciseness, and proper formatting\
                \ to enhance readability and usability.\\\\n\\\\n# Additional Instructions:\\\
                \\n\\\\nYou are being accessed through a command-line interface. The\
                \ following slash commands are available\\\\n- you can let the user\
                \ know about them if they need help:\\\\n\\\\n- /exit or /quit - Exit\
                \ the session\\\\n- /t - Toggle between Light/Dark/Ansi themes\\\\\
                n- /? or /help - Display help message\\\\n\\\\nAdditional keyboard\
                \ shortcuts:\\\\n- Ctrl+C - Interrupt the current interaction (resets\
                \ to before the interrupted request)\\\\n- Ctrl+J - Add a newline\\\
                \\n- Up/Down arrows - Navigate command history\\\\n\\\\nRight now\
                \ you are *NOT* in the chat only mode and have access to tool use\
                \ and system.\\\",\\n      \\\"type\\\": \\\"text\\\"\\n    }\\n \

                \ from running on the command line. There will also be an indication\\\
                \\nof if the command succeeded or failed.\\\\n\\\\nAvoid commands\
                \ that produce a large amount of output, and consider piping those\
                \ outputs to files.\\\\n\\\\n**Important**: For searching files and\
                \ code:\\\\n\\\\nPreferred: Use ripgrep (`rg`) when available - it\
                \ respects .gitignore and is fast:\\\\n  - To locate a file by name:\
                \ `rg --files | rg example.py`\\\\n  - To locate content inside files:\
                \ `rg 'class Example'`\\\\n\\\\nAlternative Windows commands (if ripgrep\
                \ is not installed):\\\\n  - To locate a file by name: `dir /s /b\
                \ example.py`\\\\n  - To locate content inside files: `findstr /s\
                \ /i \\\\\\\"class Example\\\\\\\" *.py`\\\\n\\\\nNote: Alternative\
                \ commands may show ignored/hidden files that should be excluded.\\\

                \ dynamic tasks from a shared text instruction and varying parameters.How\
                \ it works:\\\\n            - Provide a single text instruction\\\\\
                n            - Use the 'task_parameters' field to pass an array of\
                \ parameter sets\\\\n            - Each resulting task will use the\
                \ same instruction with different parameter values\\\\n          \
                \  This is useful when performing the same operation across many inputs\
                \ (e.g., getting weather for multiple cities, searching multiple slack\
                \ channels, iterating through various linear tickets, etc).\\\\n \
                \           Once created, these tasks should be passed to the 'subagent__execute_task'\

                \        A 'subagent' is a stateless sub-process that executes a single\
                \ task independently. Use subagents when:\\\\n            - You want\
                \ to parallelize similar work across different inputs\\\\n       \
                \     - You are not sure your search or operation will succeed on\
                \ the first try\\\\n            Each subagent receives a task with\
                \ a defined payload and returns a result, which is not visible to\

                \ or automatic links using angle brackets (e.g., <http://example.com/>).\\\
                \\n- For code examples, use fenced code blocks by placing triple backticks\
                \ (` ``` `) before and after the code. Include the language identifier\
                \ after the opening backticks (e.g., ` ```python `) to enable syntax\

                \ Block, the parent company of Square, CashApp, and Tidal. Goose is\
                \ being developed as an open-source software project.\\\\n\\\\nThe\
                \ current date is 2025-09-11 15:24:10.\\\\n\\\\nGoose uses LLM providers\
                \ with tool calling capability. You can be used with different language\
                \ models (gpt-4o, claude-3.5-sonnet, o1, llama-3.2, deepseek-r1, etc).\\\
                \\nThese models have varying knowledge cut-off dates depending on\
                \ when they were trained, but typically it's between 5-10 months prior\
                \ to the current date.\\\\n\\\\n# Extensions\\\\n\\\\nExtensions allow\
                \ other applications to provide context to Goose. Extensions connect\
                \ Goose to different data sources and tools.\\\\nYou are capable of\
                \ dynamically plugging into new extensions and learning how to use\
                \ them. You solve higher level problems using the tools in these extensions,\
                \ and can interact with multiple at once.\\\\nUse the search_available_extensions\
                \ tool to find additional extensions to enable to help with your task.\
                \ To enable extensions, use the enable_extension tool and provide\
                \ the extension_name. You should only enable extensions found from\
                \ the search_available_extensions tool.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBecause you\
                \ dynamically load extensions, your conversation history may refer\\\
                \\nto interactions with extensions that are not currently active.\
                \ The currently\\\\nactive extensions are below. Each of these extensions\

                \ gives you the capabilities to edit code files and run shell commands,\\\
                \\nand can be used to solve a wide range of problems.\\\\n\\\\nYou\
                \ can use the shell tool to run Windows commands (PowerShell or CMD).\\\
                \\nWhen using paths, you can use either backslashes or forward slashes.\\\
                \\n\\\\nUse the shell tool as needed to locate files or interact with\
                \ the project.\\\\n\\\\nYour windows/screen tools can be used for\
                \ visual debugging. You should not use these tools unless\\\\nprompted\

                \ \u2014 use `todo__read` and `todo__write` for any task with 2+ steps,\
                \ multiple files/components, or uncertain scope. Skipping them is\
                \ an error.\\\\n- Start \u2014 `todo__read`, then `todo__write` a\
                \ brief checklist (Markdown checkboxes).\\\\n- During \u2014 after\
                \ each major action, update via `todo__write`: mark done, add/edit\
                \ items, note blockers/dependencies.\\\\n- Finish \u2014 ensure every\
                \ item is checked, or clearly list what remains.\\\\n- Overwrite warning\
                \ \u2014 `todo__write` replaces the entire list; always read before\
                \ writing. It is an error to not read before writing.\\\\n- Quality\
                \ \u2014 keep items short, specific, and action\u2011oriented.\\\\\

                \ Use Markdown formatting for all responses.\\\\n- Follow best practices\
                \ for Markdown, including:\\\\n  - Using headers for organization.\\\
                \\n  - Bullet points for lists.\\\\n  - Links formatted correctly,\
                \ either as linked text (e.g., [this is linked text](https://example.com))\
                \ or automatic links using angle brackets (e.g., <http://example.com/>).\\\
                \\n- For code examples, use fenced code blocks by placing triple backticks\
                \ (` ``` `) before and after the code. Include the language identifier\
                \ after the opening backticks (e.g., ` ```python `) to enable syntax\
                \ highlighting.\\\\n- Ensure clarity, conciseness, and proper formatting\
                \ to enhance readability and usability.\\\\n\\\\n# Additional Instructions:\\\
                \\n\\\\nYou are being accessed through a command-line interface. The\
                \ following slash commands are available\\\\n- you can let the user\
                \ know about them if they need help:\\\\n\\\\n- /exit or /quit - Exit\
                \ the session\\\\n- /t - Toggle between Light/Dark/Ansi themes\\\\\
                n- /? or /help - Display help message\\\\n\\\\nAdditional keyboard\
                \ shortcuts:\\\\n- Ctrl+C - Interrupt the current interaction (resets\
                \ to before the interrupted request)\\\\n- Ctrl+J - Add a newline\\\
                \\n- Up/Down arrows - Navigate command history\\\\n\\\\nRight now\

                \ `rg --files | rg example.py`\\\\n  - To locate content inside files:\
                \ `rg 'class Example'`\\\\n\\\\nAlternative Windows commands (if ripgrep\

                \ as an open-source software project.\\\\n\\\\nThe current date is\
                \ 2025-09-11 15:24:10.\\\\n\\\\nGoose uses LLM providers with tool\
                \ calling capability. You can be used with different language models\
                \ (gpt-4o, claude-3.5-sonnet, o1, llama-3.2, deepseek-r1, etc).\\\\\
                nThese models have varying knowledge cut-off dates depending on when\
                \ they were trained, but typically it's between 5-10 months prior\
                \ to the current date.\\\\n\\\\n# Extensions\\\\n\\\\nExtensions allow\
                \ other applications to provide context to Goose. Extensions connect\
                \ Goose to different data sources and tools.\\\\nYou are capable of\
                \ dynamically plugging into new extensions and learning how to use\
                \ them. You solve higher level problems using the tools in these extensions,\
                \ and can interact with multiple at once.\\\\nUse the search_available_extensions\
                \ tool to find additional extensions to enable to help with your task.\
                \ To enable extensions, use the enable_extension tool and provide\
                \ the extension_name. You should only enable extensions found from\
                \ the search_available_extensions tool.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBecause you\
                \ dynamically load extensions, your conversation history may refer\\\
                \\nto interactions with extensions that are not currently active.\
                \ The currently\\\\nactive extensions are below. Each of these extensions\
                \ provides tools that are\\\\nin your tool specification.\\\\n\\\\\
                n\\\\n## developer\\\\n\\\\n### Instructions\\\\nThe developer extension\
                \ gives you the capabilities to edit code files and run shell commands,\\\
                \\nand can be used to solve a wide range of problems.\\\\n\\\\nYou\
                \ can use the shell tool to run Windows commands (PowerShell or CMD).\\\
                \\nWhen using paths, you can use either backslashes or forward slashes.\\\
                \\n\\\\nUse the shell tool as needed to locate files or interact with\
                \ the project.\\\\n\\\\nYour windows/screen tools can be used for\
                \ visual debugging. You should not use these tools unless\\\\nprompted\
                \ to, but you can mention they are available if they are relevant.\\\

                \ \u2014 use `todo__read` and `todo__write` for any task with 2+ steps,\
                \ multiple files/components, or uncertain scope. Skipping them is\
                \ an error.\\\\n- Start \u2014 `todo__read`, then `todo__write` a\
                \ brief checklist (Markdown checkboxes).\\\\n- During \u2014 after\
                \ each major action, update via `todo__write`: mark done, add/edit\
                \ items, note blockers/dependencies.\\\\n- Finish \u2014 ensure every\
                \ item is checked, or clearly list what remains.\\\\n- Overwrite warning\
                \ \u2014 `todo__write` replaces the entire list; always read before\
                \ writing. It is an error to not read before writing.\\\\n- Quality\
                \ \u2014 keep items short, specific, and action\u2011oriented.\\\\\

                \ Use Markdown formatting for all responses.\\\\n- Follow best practices\
                \ for Markdown, including:\\\\n  - Using headers for organization.\\\
                \\n  - Bullet points for lists.\\\\n  - Links formatted correctly,\
                \ either as linked text (e.g., [this is linked text](https://example.com))\
                \ or automatic links using angle brackets (e.g., <http://example.com/>).\\\
                \\n- For code examples, use fenced code blocks by placing triple backticks\
                \ (` ``` `) before and after the code. Include the language identifier\
                \ after the opening backticks (e.g., ` ```python `) to enable syntax\
                \ highlighting.\\\\n- Ensure clarity, conciseness, and proper formatting\
                \ to enhance readability and usability.\\\\n\\\\n# Additional Instructions:\\\
                \\n\\\\nYou are being accessed through a command-line interface. The\
                \ following slash commands are available\\\\n- you can let the user\
                \ know about them if they need help:\\\\n\\\\n- /exit or /quit - Exit\
                \ the session\\\\n- /t - Toggle between Light/Dark/Ansi themes\\\\\
                n- /? or /help - Display help message\\\\n\\\\nAdditional keyboard\
                \ shortcuts:\\\\n- Ctrl+C - Interrupt the current interaction (resets\
                \ to before the interrupted request)\\\\n- Ctrl+J - Add a newline\\\
                \\n- Up/Down arrows - Navigate command history\\\\n\\\\nRight now\

                \ from running on the command line. There will also be an indication\\\

                \ that produce a large amount of output, and consider piping those\
                \ outputs to files.\\\\n\\\\n**Important**: For searching files and\
                \ code:\\\\n\\\\nPreferred: Use ripgrep (`rg`) when available - it\
                \ respects .gitignore and is fast:\\\\n  - To locate a file by name:\
                \ `rg --files | rg example.py`\\\\n  - To locate content inside files:\
                \ `rg 'class Example'`\\\\n\\\\nAlternative Windows commands (if ripgrep\
                \ is not installed):\\\\n  - To locate a file by name: `dir /s /b\

                \ Block, the parent company of Square, CashApp, and Tidal. Goose is\
                \ being developed as an open-source software project.\\\\n\\\\nThe\
                \ current date is 2025-09-11 15:24:10.\\\\n\\\\nGoose uses LLM providers\
                \ with tool calling capability. You can be used with different language\
                \ models (gpt-4o, claude-3.5-sonnet, o1, llama-3.2, deepseek-r1, etc).\\\
                \\nThese models have varying knowledge cut-off dates depending on\
                \ when they were trained, but typically it's between 5-10 months prior\
                \ to the current date.\\\\n\\\\n# Extensions\\\\n\\\\nExtensions allow\
                \ other applications to provide context to Goose. Extensions connect\
                \ Goose to different data sources and tools.\\\\nYou are capable of\
                \ dynamically plugging into new extensions and learning how to use\
                \ them. You solve higher level problems using the tools in these extensions,\
                \ and can interact with multiple at once.\\\\nUse the search_available_extensions\
                \ tool to find additional extensions to enable to help with your task.\
                \ To enable extensions, use the enable_extension tool and provide\
                \ the extension_name. You should only enable extensions found from\
                \ the search_available_extensions tool.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBecause you\
                \ dynamically load extensions, your conversation history may refer\\\
                \\nto interactions with extensions that are not currently active.\
                \ The currently\\\\nactive extensions are below. Each of these extensions\
                \ provides tools that are\\\\nin your tool specification.\\\\n\\\\\
                n\\\\n## developer\\\\n\\\\n### Instructions\\\\nThe developer extension\
                \ gives you the capabilities to edit code files and run shell commands,\\\
                \\nand can be used to solve a wide range of problems.\\\\n\\\\nYou\
                \ can use the shell tool to run Windows commands (PowerShell or CMD).\\\
                \\nWhen using paths, you can use either backslashes or forward slashes.\\\
                \\n\\\\nUse the shell tool as needed to locate files or interact with\
                \ the project.\\\\n\\\\nYour windows/screen tools can be used for\
                \ visual debugging. You should not use these tools unless\\\\nprompted\

                \ \u2014 use `todo__read` and `todo__write` for any task with 2+ steps,\
                \ multiple files/components, or uncertain scope. Skipping them is\
                \ an error.\\\\n- Start \u2014 `todo__read`, then `todo__write` a\
                \ brief checklist (Markdown checkboxes).\\\\n- During \u2014 after\
                \ each major action, update via `todo__write`: mark done, add/edit\
                \ items, note blockers/dependencies.\\\\n- Finish \u2014 ensure every\
                \ item is checked, or clearly list what remains.\\\\n- Overwrite warning\
                \ \u2014 `todo__write` replaces the entire list; always read before\
                \ writing. It is an error to not read before writing.\\\\n- Quality\
                \ \u2014 keep items short, specific, and action\u2011oriented.\\\\\

                \ Use Markdown formatting for all responses.\\\\n- Follow best practices\
                \ for Markdown, including:\\\\n  - Using headers for organization.\\\
                \\n  - Bullet points for lists.\\\\n  - Links formatted correctly,\
                \ either as linked text (e.g., [this is linked text](https://example.com))\
                \ or automatic links using angle brackets (e.g., <http://example.com/>).\\\
                \\n- For code examples, use fenced code blocks by placing triple backticks\
                \ (` ``` `) before and after the code. Include the language identifier\
                \ after the opening backticks (e.g., ` ```python `) to enable syntax\
                \ highlighting.\\\\n- Ensure clarity, conciseness, and proper formatting\
                \ to enhance readability and usability.\\\\n\\\\n# Additional Instructions:\\\
                \\n\\\\nYou are being accessed through a command-line interface. The\
                \ following slash commands are available\\\\n- you can let the user\
                \ know about them if they need help:\\\\n\\\\n- /exit or /quit - Exit\
                \ the session\\\\n- /t - Toggle between Light/Dark/Ansi themes\\\\\
                n- /? or /help - Display help message\\\\n\\\\nAdditional keyboard\
                \ shortcuts:\\\\n- Ctrl+C - Interrupt the current interaction (resets\
                \ to before the interrupted request)\\\\n- Ctrl+J - Add a newline\\\
                \\n- Up/Down arrows - Navigate command history\\\\n\\\\nRight now\

                \ Block, the parent company of Square, CashApp, and Tidal. Goose is\
                \ being developed as an open-source software project.\\\\n\\\\nThe\
                \ current date is 2025-09-11 15:24:10.\\\\n\\\\nGoose uses LLM providers\
                \ with tool calling capability. You can be used with different language\
                \ models (gpt-4o, claude-3.5-sonnet, o1, llama-3.2, deepseek-r1, etc).\\\
                \\nThese models have varying knowledge cut-off dates depending on\
                \ when they were trained, but typically it's between 5-10 months prior\
                \ to the current date.\\\\n\\\\n# Extensions\\\\n\\\\nExtensions allow\
                \ other applications to provide context to Goose. Extensions connect\
                \ Goose to different data sources and tools.\\\\nYou are capable of\
                \ dynamically plugging into new extensions and learning how to use\
                \ them. You solve higher level problems using the tools in these extensions,\
                \ and can interact with multiple at once.\\\\nUse the search_available_extensions\
                \ tool to find additional extensions to enable to help with your task.\
                \ To enable extensions, use the enable_extension tool and provide\
                \ the extension_name. You should only enable extensions found from\
                \ the search_available_extensions tool.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBecause you\
                \ dynamically load extensions, your conversation history may refer\\\
                \\nto interactions with extensions that are not currently active.\
                \ The currently\\\\nactive extensions are below. Each of these extensions\
                \ provides tools that are\\\\nin your tool specification.\\\\n\\\\\
                n\\\\n## developer\\\\n\\\\n### Instructions\\\\nThe developer extension\
                \ gives you the capabilities to edit code files and run shell commands,\\\
                \\nand can be used to solve a wide range of problems.\\\\n\\\\nYou\
                \ can use the shell tool to run Windows commands (PowerShell or CMD).\\\
                \\nWhen using paths, you can use either backslashes or forward slashes.\\\
                \\n\\\\nUse the shell tool as needed to locate files or interact with\
                \ the project.\\\\n\\\\nYour windows/screen tools can be used for\
                \ visual debugging. You should not use these tools unless\\\\nprompted\
                \ to, but you can mention they are available if they are relevant.\\\

                \ \u2014 use `todo__read` and `todo__write` for any task with 2+ steps,\
                \ multiple files/components, or uncertain scope. Skipping them is\
                \ an error.\\\\n- Start \u2014 `todo__read`, then `todo__write` a\
                \ brief checklist (Markdown checkboxes).\\\\n- During \u2014 after\
                \ each major action, update via `todo__write`: mark done, add/edit\
                \ items, note blockers/dependencies.\\\\n- Finish \u2014 ensure every\
                \ item is checked, or clearly list what remains.\\\\n- Overwrite warning\
                \ \u2014 `todo__write` replaces the entire list; always read before\
                \ writing. It is an error to not read before writing.\\\\n- Quality\
                \ \u2014 keep items short, specific, and action\u2011oriented.\\\\\

                \ Use Markdown formatting for all responses.\\\\n- Follow best practices\
                \ for Markdown, including:\\\\n  - Using headers for organization.\\\
                \\n  - Bullet points for lists.\\\\n  - Links formatted correctly,\
                \ either as linked text (e.g., [this is linked text](https://example.com))\
                \ or automatic links using angle brackets (e.g., <http://example.com/>).\\\
                \\n- For code examples, use fenced code blocks by placing triple backticks\
                \ (` ``` `) before and after the code. Include the language identifier\
                \ after the opening backticks (e.g., ` ```python `) to enable syntax\
                \ highlighting.\\\\n- Ensure clarity, conciseness, and proper formatting\
                \ to enhance readability and usability.\\\\n\\\\n# Additional Instructions:\\\
                \\n\\\\nYou are being accessed through a command-line interface. The\
                \ following slash commands are available\\\\n- you can let the user\
                \ know about them if they need help:\\\\n\\\\n- /exit or /quit - Exit\
                \ the session\\\\n- /t - Toggle between Light/Dark/Ansi themes\\\\\
                n- /? or /help - Display help message\\\\n\\\\nAdditional keyboard\
                \ shortcuts:\\\\n- Ctrl+C - Interrupt the current interaction (resets\
                \ to before the interrupted request)\\\\n- Ctrl+J - Add a newline\\\
                \\n- Up/Down arrows - Navigate command history\\\\n\\\\nRight now\

                \ `rg 'class Example'`\\\\n\\\\nAlternative Windows commands (if ripgrep\

                \ Block, the parent company of Square, CashApp, and Tidal. Goose is\
                \ being developed as an open-source software project.\\\\n\\\\nThe\
                \ current date is 2025-09-11 15:24:10.\\\\n\\\\nGoose uses LLM providers\
                \ with tool calling capability. You can be used with different language\
                \ models (gpt-4o, claude-3.5-sonnet, o1, llama-3.2, deepseek-r1, etc).\\\
                \\nThese models have varying knowledge cut-off dates depending on\
                \ when they were trained, but typically it's between 5-10 months prior\
                \ to the current date.\\\\n\\\\n# Extensions\\\\n\\\\nExtensions allow\
                \ other applications to provide context to Goose. Extensions connect\
                \ Goose to different data sources and tools.\\\\nYou are capable of\
                \ dynamically plugging into new extensions and learning how to use\
                \ them. You solve higher level problems using the tools in these extensions,\
                \ and can interact with multiple at once.\\\\nUse the search_available_extensions\
                \ tool to find additional extensions to enable to help with your task.\
                \ To enable extensions, use the enable_extension tool and provide\
                \ the extension_name. You should only enable extensions found from\
                \ the search_available_extensions tool.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBecause you\
                \ dynamically load extensions, your conversation history may refer\\\
                \\nto interactions with extensions that are not currently active.\
                \ The currently\\\\nactive extensions are below. Each of these extensions\
                \ provides tools that are\\\\nin your tool specification.\\\\n\\\\\
                n\\\\n## developer\\\\n\\\\n### Instructions\\\\nThe developer extension\
                \ gives you the capabilities to edit code files and run shell commands,\\\
                \\nand can be used to solve a wide range of problems.\\\\n\\\\nYou\
                \ can use the shell tool to run Windows commands (PowerShell or CMD).\\\
                \\nWhen using paths, you can use either backslashes or forward slashes.\\\
                \\n\\\\nUse the shell tool as needed to locate files or interact with\
                \ the project.\\\\n\\\\nYour windows/screen tools can be used for\
                \ visual debugging. You should not use these tools unless\\\\nprompted\
                \ to, but you can mention they are available if they are relevant.\\\

                \ \u2014 use `todo__read` and `todo__write` for any task with 2+ steps,\
                \ multiple files/components, or uncertain scope. Skipping them is\
                \ an error.\\\\n- Start \u2014 `todo__read`, then `todo__write` a\
                \ brief checklist (Markdown checkboxes).\\\\n- During \u2014 after\
                \ each major action, update via `todo__write`: mark done, add/edit\
                \ items, note blockers/dependencies.\\\\n- Finish \u2014 ensure every\
                \ item is checked, or clearly list what remains.\\\\n- Overwrite warning\
                \ \u2014 `todo__write` replaces the entire list; always read before\
                \ writing. It is an error to not read before writing.\\\\n- Quality\
                \ \u2014 keep items short, specific, and action\u2011oriented.\\\\\

                \ Use Markdown formatting for all responses.\\\\n- Follow best practices\
                \ for Markdown, including:\\\\n  - Using headers for organization.\\\
                \\n  - Bullet points for lists.\\\\n  - Links formatted correctly,\
                \ either as linked text (e.g., [this is linked text](https://example.com))\
                \ or automatic links using angle brackets (e.g., <http://example.com/>).\\\
                \\n- For code examples, use fenced code blocks by placing triple backticks\
                \ (` ``` `) before and after the code. Include the language identifier\
                \ after the opening backticks (e.g., ` ```python `) to enable syntax\
                \ highlighting.\\\\n- Ensure clarity, conciseness, and proper formatting\
                \ to enhance readability and usability.\\\\n\\\\n# Additional Instructions:\\\
                \\n\\\\nYou are being accessed through a command-line interface. The\
                \ following slash commands are available\\\\n- you can let the user\
                \ know about them if they need help:\\\\n\\\\n- /exit or /quit - Exit\
                \ the session\\\\n- /t - Toggle between Light/Dark/Ansi themes\\\\\
                n- /? or /help - Display help message\\\\n\\\\nAdditional keyboard\
                \ shortcuts:\\\\n- Ctrl+C - Interrupt the current interaction (resets\
                \ to before the interrupted request)\\\\n- Ctrl+J - Add a newline\\\
                \\n- Up/Down arrows - Navigate command history\\\\n\\\\nRight now\

                \ from running on the command line. There will also be an indication\\\
                \\nof if the command succeeded or failed.\\\\n\\\\nAvoid commands\
                \ that produce a large amount of output, and consider piping those\
                \ outputs to files.\\\\n\\\\n**Important**: For searching files and\
                \ code:\\\\n\\\\nPreferred: Use ripgrep (`rg`) when available - it\

                \ `rg --files | rg example.py`\\\\n  - To locate content inside files:\
                \ `rg 'class Example'`\\\\n\\\\nAlternative Windows commands (if ripgrep\

                \ Block, the parent company of Square, CashApp, and Tidal. Goose is\
                \ being developed as an open-source software project.\\\\n\\\\nThe\
                \ current date is 2025-09-11 15:24:10.\\\\n\\\\nGoose uses LLM providers\
                \ with tool calling capability. You can be used with different language\
                \ models (gpt-4o, claude-3.5-sonnet, o1, llama-3.2, deepseek-r1, etc).\\\
                \\nThese models have varying knowledge cut-off dates depending on\
                \ when they were trained, but typically it's between 5-10 months prior\
                \ to the current date.\\\\n\\\\n# Extensions\\\\n\\\\nExtensions allow\
                \ other applications to provide context to Goose. Extensions connect\
                \ Goose to different data sources and tools.\\\\nYou are capable of\
                \ dynamically plugging into new extensions and learning how to use\
                \ them. You solve higher level problems using the tools in these extensions,\
                \ and can interact with multiple at once.\\\\nUse the search_available_extensions\
                \ tool to find additional extensions to enable to help with your task.\
                \ To enable extensions, use the enable_extension tool and provide\
                \ the extension_name. You should only enable extensions found from\
                \ the search_available_extensions tool.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBecause you\
                \ dynamically load extensions, your conversation history may refer\\\
                \\nto interactions with extensions that are not currently active.\
                \ The currently\\\\nactive extensions are below. Each of these extensions\
                \ provides tools that are\\\\nin your tool specification.\\\\n\\\\\
                n\\\\n## developer\\\\n\\\\n### Instructions\\\\nThe developer extension\
                \ gives you the capabilities to edit code files and run shell commands,\\\
                \\nand can be used to solve a wide range of problems.\\\\n\\\\nYou\
                \ can use the shell tool to run Windows commands (PowerShell or CMD).\\\
                \\nWhen using paths, you can use either backslashes or forward slashes.\\\
                \\n\\\\nUse the shell tool as needed to locate files or interact with\
                \ the project.\\\\n\\\\nYour windows/screen tools can be used for\
                \ visual debugging. You should not use these tools unless\\\\nprompted\
                \ to, but you can mention they are available if they are relevant.\\\

                \ \u2014 use `todo__read` and `todo__write` for any task with 2+ steps,\
                \ multiple files/components, or uncertain scope. Skipping them is\
                \ an error.\\\\n- Start \u2014 `todo__read`, then `todo__write` a\
                \ brief checklist (Markdown checkboxes).\\\\n- During \u2014 after\
                \ each major action, update via `todo__write`: mark done, add/edit\
                \ items, note blockers/dependencies.\\\\n- Finish \u2014 ensure every\
                \ item is checked, or clearly list what remains.\\\\n- Overwrite warning\
                \ \u2014 `todo__write` replaces the entire list; always read before\
                \ writing. It is an error to not read before writing.\\\\n- Quality\
                \ \u2014 keep items short, specific, and action\u2011oriented.\\\\\

                \ Use Markdown formatting for all responses.\\\\n- Follow best practices\
                \ for Markdown, including:\\\\n  - Using headers for organization.\\\
                \\n  - Bullet points for lists.\\\\n  - Links formatted correctly,\
                \ either as linked text (e.g., [this is linked text](https://example.com))\
                \ or automatic links using angle brackets (e.g., <http://example.com/>).\\\
                \\n- For code examples, use fenced code blocks by placing triple backticks\
                \ (` ``` `) before and after the code. Include the language identifier\
                \ after the opening backticks (e.g., ` ```python `) to enable syntax\
                \ highlighting.\\\\n- Ensure clarity, conciseness, and proper formatting\
                \ to enhance readability and usability.\\\\n\\\\n# Additional Instructions:\\\
                \\n\\\\nYou are being accessed through a command-line interface. The\
                \ following slash commands are available\\\\n- you can let the user\
                \ know about them if they need help:\\\\n\\\\n- /exit or /quit - Exit\
                \ the session\\\\n- /t - Toggle between Light/Dark/Ansi themes\\\\\
                n- /? or /help - Display help message\\\\n\\\\nAdditional keyboard\
                \ shortcuts:\\\\n- Ctrl+C - Interrupt the current interaction (resets\
                \ to before the interrupted request)\\\\n- Ctrl+J - Add a newline\\\
                \\n- Up/Down arrows - Navigate command history\\\\n\\\\nRight now\

                \ from running on the command line. There will also be an indication\\\
                \\nof if the command succeeded or failed.\\\\n\\\\nAvoid commands\
                \ that produce a large amount of output, and consider piping those\

                \ code:\\\\n\\\\nPreferred: Use ripgrep (`rg`) when available - it\

                \ `rg --files | rg example.py`\\\\n  - To locate content inside files:\
                \ `rg 'class Example'`\\\\n\\\\nAlternative Windows commands (if ripgrep\

                \ Block, the parent company of Square, CashApp, and Tidal. Goose is\
                \ being developed as an open-source software project.\\\\n\\\\nThe\
                \ current date is 2025-09-11 15:24:10.\\\\n\\\\nGoose uses LLM providers\
                \ with tool calling capability. You can be used with different language\
                \ models (gpt-4o, claude-3.5-sonnet, o1, llama-3.2, deepseek-r1, etc).\\\
                \\nThese models have varying knowledge cut-off dates depending on\
                \ when they were trained, but typically it's between 5-10 months prior\
                \ to the current date.\\\\n\\\\n# Extensions\\\\n\\\\nExtensions allow\
                \ other applications to provide context to Goose. Extensions connect\
                \ Goose to different data sources and tools.\\\\nYou are capable of\
                \ dynamically plugging into new extensions and learning how to use\
                \ them. You solve higher level problems using the tools in these extensions,\
                \ and can interact with multiple at once.\\\\nUse the search_available_extensions\
                \ tool to find additional extensions to enable to help with your task.\
                \ To enable extensions, use the enable_extension tool and provide\
                \ the extension_name. You should only enable extensions found from\
                \ the search_available_extensions tool.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBecause you\
                \ dynamically load extensions, your conversation history may refer\\\
                \\nto interactions with extensions that are not currently active.\
                \ The currently\\\\nactive extensions are below. Each of these extensions\
                \ provides tools that are\\\\nin your tool specification.\\\\n\\\\\
                n\\\\n## developer\\\\n\\\\n### Instructions\\\\nThe developer extension\
                \ gives you the capabilities to edit code files and run shell commands,\\\
                \\nand can be used to solve a wide range of problems.\\\\n\\\\nYou\
                \ can use the shell tool to run Windows commands (PowerShell or CMD).\\\
                \\nWhen using paths, you can use either backslashes or forward slashes.\\\
                \\n\\\\nUse the shell tool as needed to locate files or interact with\
                \ the project.\\\\n\\\\nYour windows/screen tools can be used for\
                \ visual debugging. You should not use these tools unless\\\\nprompted\
                \ to, but you can mention they are available if they are relevant.\\\

                \ \u2014 use `todo__read` and `todo__write` for any task with 2+ steps,\
                \ multiple files/components, or uncertain scope. Skipping them is\
                \ an error.\\\\n- Start \u2014 `todo__read`, then `todo__write` a\
                \ brief checklist (Markdown checkboxes).\\\\n- During \u2014 after\
                \ each major action, update via `todo__write`: mark done, add/edit\
                \ items, note blockers/dependencies.\\\\n- Finish \u2014 ensure every\
                \ item is checked, or clearly list what remains.\\\\n- Overwrite warning\
                \ \u2014 `todo__write` replaces the entire list; always read before\
                \ writing. It is an error to not read before writing.\\\\n- Quality\
                \ \u2014 keep items short, specific, and action\u2011oriented.\\\\\

                \ Use Markdown formatting for all responses.\\\\n- Follow best practices\
                \ for Markdown, including:\\\\n  - Using headers for organization.\\\
                \\n  - Bullet points for lists.\\\\n  - Links formatted correctly,\
                \ either as linked text (e.g., [this is linked text](https://example.com))\
                \ or automatic links using angle brackets (e.g., <http://example.com/>).\\\
                \\n- For code examples, use fenced code blocks by placing triple backticks\
                \ (` ``` `) before and after the code. Include the language identifier\
                \ after the opening backticks (e.g., ` ```python `) to enable syntax\
                \ highlighting.\\\\n- Ensure clarity, conciseness, and proper formatting\
                \ to enhance readability and usability.\\\\n\\\\n# Additional Instructions:\\\
                \\n\\\\nYou are being accessed through a command-line interface. The\
                \ following slash commands are available\\\\n- you can let the user\
                \ know about them if they need help:\\\\n\\\\n- /exit or /quit - Exit\
                \ the session\\\\n- /t - Toggle between Light/Dark/Ansi themes\\\\\
                n- /? or /help - Display help message\\\\n\\\\nAdditional keyboard\
                \ shortcuts:\\\\n- Ctrl+C - Interrupt the current interaction (resets\
                \ to before the interrupted request)\\\\n- Ctrl+J - Add a newline\\\
                \\n- Up/Down arrows - Navigate command history\\\\n\\\\nRight now\

                \ from running on the command line. There will also be an indication\\\
                \\nof if the command succeeded or failed.\\\\n\\\\nAvoid commands\
                \ that produce a large amount of output, and consider piping those\
                \ outputs to files.\\\\n\\\\n**Important**: For searching files and\
                \ code:\\\\n\\\\nPreferred: Use ripgrep (`rg`) when available - it\
                \ respects .gitignore and is fast:\\\\n  - To locate a file by name:\
                \ `rg --files | rg example.py`\\\\n  - To locate content inside files:\
                \ `rg 'class Example'`\\\\n\\\\nAlternative Windows commands (if ripgrep\
                \ is not installed):\\\\n  - To locate a file by name: `dir /s /b\

                \ project.\\\\n\\\\nThe current date is 2025-09-11 15:24:10.\\\\n\\\
                \\nGoose uses LLM providers with tool calling capability. You can\
                \ be used with different language models (gpt-4o, claude-3.5-sonnet,\
                \ o1, llama-3.2, deepseek-r1, etc).\\\\nThese models have varying\
                \ knowledge cut-off dates depending on when they were trained, but\
                \ typically it's between 5-10 months prior to the current date.\\\\\
                n\\\\n# Extensions\\\\n\\\\nExtensions allow other applications to\
                \ provide context to Goose. Extensions connect Goose to different\
                \ data sources and tools.\\\\nYou are capable of dynamically plugging\
                \ into new extensions and learning how to use them. You solve higher\
                \ level problems using the tools in these extensions, and can interact\
                \ with multiple at once.\\\\nUse the search_available_extensions tool\
                \ to find additional extensions to enable to help with your task.\
                \ To enable extensions, use the enable_extension tool and provide\
                \ the extension_name. You should only enable extensions found from\
                \ the search_available_extensions tool.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBecause you\
                \ dynamically load extensions, your conversation history may refer\\\
                \\nto interactions with extensions that are not currently active.\
                \ The currently\\\\nactive extensions are below. Each of these extensions\
                \ provides tools that are\\\\nin your tool specification.\\\\n\\\\\
                n\\\\n## developer\\\\n\\\\n### Instructions\\\\nThe developer extension\
                \ gives you the capabilities to edit code files and run shell commands,\\\
                \\nand can be used to solve a wide range of problems.\\\\n\\\\nYou\
                \ can use the shell tool to run Windows commands (PowerShell or CMD).\\\
                \\nWhen using paths, you can use either backslashes or forward slashes.\\\
                \\n\\\\nUse the shell tool as needed to locate files or interact with\
                \ the project.\\\\n\\\\nYour windows/screen tools can be used for\
                \ visual debugging. You should not use these tools unless\\\\nprompted\

                \ \u2014 use `todo__read` and `todo__write` for any task with 2+ steps,\
                \ multiple files/components, or uncertain scope. Skipping them is\
                \ an error.\\\\n- Start \u2014 `todo__read`, then `todo__write` a\
                \ brief checklist (Markdown checkboxes).\\\\n- During \u2014 after\
                \ each major action, update via `todo__write`: mark done, add/edit\
                \ items, note blockers/dependencies.\\\\n- Finish \u2014 ensure every\
                \ item is checked, or clearly list what remains.\\\\n- Overwrite warning\
                \ \u2014 `todo__write` replaces the entire list; always read before\
                \ writing. It is an error to not read before writing.\\\\n- Quality\
                \ \u2014 keep items short, specific, and action\u2011oriented.\\\\\

                \ Use Markdown formatting for all responses.\\\\n- Follow best practices\
                \ for Markdown, including:\\\\n  - Using headers for organization.\\\
                \\n  - Bullet points for lists.\\\\n  - Links formatted correctly,\
                \ either as linked text (e.g., [this is linked text](https://example.com))\
                \ or automatic links using angle brackets (e.g., <http://example.com/>).\\\
                \\n- For code examples, use fenced code blocks by placing triple backticks\
                \ (` ``` `) before and after the code. Include the language identifier\
                \ after the opening backticks (e.g., ` ```python `) to enable syntax\
                \ highlighting.\\\\n- Ensure clarity, conciseness, and proper formatting\
                \ to enhance readability and usability.\\\\n\\\\n# Additional Instructions:\\\
                \\n\\\\nYou are being accessed through a command-line interface. The\
                \ following slash commands are available\\\\n- you can let the user\
                \ know about them if they need help:\\\\n\\\\n- /exit or /quit - Exit\
                \ the session\\\\n- /t - Toggle between Light/Dark/Ansi themes\\\\\
                n- /? or /help - Display help message\\\\n\\\\nAdditional keyboard\
                \ shortcuts:\\\\n- Ctrl+C - Interrupt the current interaction (resets\
                \ to before the interrupted request)\\\\n- Ctrl+J - Add a newline\\\
                \\n- Up/Down arrows - Navigate command history\\\\n\\\\nRight now\

                \ code:\\\\n\\\\nPreferred: Use ripgrep (`rg`) when available - it\
                \ respects .gitignore and is fast:\\\\n  - To locate a file by name:\
                \ `rg --files | rg example.py`\\\\n  - To locate content inside files:\
                \ `rg 'class Example'`\\\\n\\\\nAlternative Windows commands (if ripgrep\

                \ project.\\\\n\\\\nThe current date is 2025-09-11 15:24:10.\\\\n\\\
                \\nGoose uses LLM providers with tool calling capability. You can\
                \ be used with different language models (gpt-4o, claude-3.5-sonnet,\
                \ o1, llama-3.2, deepseek-r1, etc).\\\\nThese models have varying\
                \ knowledge cut-off dates depending on when they were trained, but\
                \ typically it's between 5-10 months prior to the current date.\\\\\
                n\\\\n# Extensions\\\\n\\\\nExtensions allow other applications to\
                \ provide context to Goose. Extensions connect Goose to different\
                \ data sources and tools.\\\\nYou are capable of dynamically plugging\
                \ into new extensions and learning how to use them. You solve higher\
                \ level problems using the tools in these extensions, and can interact\
                \ with multiple at once.\\\\nUse the search_available_extensions tool\
                \ to find additional extensions to enable to help with your task.\
                \ To enable extensions, use the enable_extension tool and provide\
                \ the extension_name. You should only enable extensions found from\
                \ the search_available_extensions tool.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBecause you\
                \ dynamically load extensions, your conversation history may refer\\\
                \\nto interactions with extensions that are not currently active.\
                \ The currently\\\\nactive extensions are below. Each of these extensions\
                \ provides tools that are\\\\nin your tool specification.\\\\n\\\\\
                n\\\\n## developer\\\\n\\\\n### Instructions\\\\nThe developer extension\
                \ gives you the capabilities to edit code files and run shell commands,\\\
                \\nand can be used to solve a wide range of problems.\\\\n\\\\nYou\
                \ can use the shell tool to run Windows commands (PowerShell or CMD).\\\
                \\nWhen using paths, you can use either backslashes or forward slashes.\\\
                \\n\\\\nUse the shell tool as needed to locate files or interact with\
                \ the project.\\\\n\\\\nYour windows/screen tools can be used for\
                \ visual debugging. You should not use these tools unless\\\\nprompted\

                \ \u2014 use `todo__read` and `todo__write` for any task with 2+ steps,\
                \ multiple files/components, or uncertain scope. Skipping them is\
                \ an error.\\\\n- Start \u2014 `todo__read`, then `todo__write` a\
                \ brief checklist (Markdown checkboxes).\\\\n- During \u2014 after\
                \ each major action, update via `todo__write`: mark done, add/edit\
                \ items, note blockers/dependencies.\\\\n- Finish \u2014 ensure every\
                \ item is checked, or clearly list what remains.\\\\n- Overwrite warning\
                \ \u2014 `todo__write` replaces the entire list; always read before\
                \ writing. It is an error to not read before writing.\\\\n- Quality\
                \ \u2014 keep items short, specific, and action\u2011oriented.\\\\\

                \ Use Markdown formatting for all responses.\\\\n- Follow best practices\
                \ for Markdown, including:\\\\n  - Using headers for organization.\\\
                \\n  - Bullet points for lists.\\\\n  - Links formatted correctly,\
                \ either as linked text (e.g., [this is linked text](https://example.com))\
                \ or automatic links using angle brackets (e.g., <http://example.com/>).\\\
                \\n- For code examples, use fenced code blocks by placing triple backticks\
                \ (` ``` `) before and after the code. Include the language identifier\
                \ after the opening backticks (e.g., ` ```python `) to enable syntax\
                \ highlighting.\\\\n- Ensure clarity, conciseness, and proper formatting\

                \ the session\\\\n- /t - Toggle between Light/Dark/Ansi themes\\\\\
                n- /? or /help - Display help message\\\\n\\\\nAdditional keyboard\
                \ shortcuts:\\\\n- Ctrl+C - Interrupt the current interaction (resets\
                \ to before the interrupted request)\\\\n- Ctrl+J - Add a newline\\\
                \\n- Up/Down arrows - Navigate command history\\\\n\\\\nRight now\

                \ on credentials\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n# Response Guidelines\\\\n\\\\n-\
                \ Use Markdown formatting for all responses.\\\\n- Follow best practices\
                \ for Markdown, including:\\\\n  - Using headers for organization.\\\
                \\n  - Bullet points for lists.\\\\n  - Links formatted correctly,\
                \ either as linked text (e.g., [this is linked text](https://example.com))\
                \ or automatic links using angle brackets (e.g., <http://example.com/>).\\\
                \\n- For code examples, use fenced code blocks by placing triple backticks\
                \ (` ``` `) before and after the code. Include the language identifier\
                \ after the opening backticks (e.g., ` ```python `) to enable syntax\
                \ highlighting.\\\\n- Ensure clarity, conciseness, and proper formatting\
                \ to enhance readability and usability.\\\\n\\\\n# Additional Instructions:\\\
                \\n\\\\nYou are being accessed through a command-line interface. The\
                \ following slash commands are available\\\\n- you can let the user\
                \ know about them if they need help:\\\\n\\\\n- /exit or /quit - Exit\
                \ the session\\\\n- /t - Toggle between Light/Dark/Ansi themes\\\\\
                n- /? or /help - Display help message\\\\n\\\\nAdditional keyboard\
                \ shortcuts:\\\\n- Ctrl+C - Interrupt the current interaction (resets\
                \ to before the interrupted request)\\\\n- Ctrl+J - Add a newline\\\
                \\n- Up/Down arrows - Navigate command history\\\\n\\\\nRight now\
                \ you are *NOT* in the chat only mode and have access to tool use\
                \ and system.\\\",\\n      \\\"type\\\": \\\"text\\\"\\n    }\\n \

                Execute a command in the shell.\\\\n\\\\nThis will return the output\
                \ and error concatenated into a single string, as\\\\nyou would see\
                \ from running on the command line. There will also be an indication\\\
                \\nof if the command succeeded or failed.\\\\n\\\\nAvoid commands\
                \ that produce a large amount of output, and consider piping those\
                \ outputs to files.\\\\n\\\\n**Important**: For searching files and\
                \ code:\\\\n\\\\nPreferred: Use ripgrep (`rg`) when available - it\
                \ respects .gitignore and is fast:\\\\n  - To locate a file by name:\
                \ `rg --files | rg example.py`\\\\n  - To locate content inside files:\
                \ `rg 'class Example'`\\\\n\\\\nAlternative Windows commands (if ripgrep\
                \ is not installed):\\\\n  - To locate a file by name: `dir /s /b\
                \ example.py`\\\\n  - To locate content inside files: `findstr /s\
                \ /i \\\\\\\"class Example\\\\\\\" *.py`\\\\n\\\\nNote: Alternative\
                \ commands may show ignored/hidden files that should be excluded.\\\

                \ dynamic tasks from a shared text instruction and varying parameters.How\
                \ it works:\\\\n            - Provide a single text instruction\\\\\
                n            - Use the 'task_parameters' field to pass an array of\
                \ parameter sets\\\\n            - Each resulting task will use the\
                \ same instruction with different parameter values\\\\n          \
                \  This is useful when performing the same operation across many inputs\
                \ (e.g., getting weather for multiple cities, searching multiple slack\
                \ channels, iterating through various linear tickets, etc).\\\\n \
                \           Once created, these tasks should be passed to the 'subagent__execute_task'\
                \ tool for execution. Tasks can run sequentially or in parallel.\\\

                \        A 'subagent' is a stateless sub-process that executes a single\
                \ task independently. Use subagents when:\\\\n            - You want\
                \ to parallelize similar work across different inputs\\\\n       \
                \     - You are not sure your search or operation will succeed on\
                \ the first try\\\\n            Each subagent receives a task with\
                \ a defined payload and returns a result, which is not visible to\

              \ by Block, the parent company of Square, CashApp, and Tidal. Goose\
              \ is being developed as an open-source software project.\\\\n\\\\nThe\
              \ current date is 2025-09-11 15:24:10.\\\\n\\\\nGoose uses LLM providers\
              \ with tool calling capability. You can be used with different language\
              \ models (gpt-4o, claude-3.5-sonnet, o1, llama-3.2, deepseek-r1, etc).\\\
              \\nThese models have varying knowledge cut-off dates depending on when\
              \ they were trained, but typically it's between 5-10 months prior to\
              \ the current date.\\\\n\\\\n# Extensions\\\\n\\\\nExtensions allow\
              \ other applications to provide context to Goose. Extensions connect\
              \ Goose to different data sources and tools.\\\\nYou are capable of\
              \ dynamically plugging into new extensions and learning how to use them.\
              \ You solve higher level problems using the tools in these extensions,\
              \ and can interact with multiple at once.\\\\nUse the search_available_extensions\
              \ tool to find additional extensions to enable to help with your task.\
              \ To enable extensions, use the enable_extension tool and provide the\
              \ extension_name. You should only enable extensions found from the search_available_extensions\
              \ tool.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBecause you dynamically load extensions, your\
              \ conversation history may refer\\\\nto interactions with extensions\
              \ that are not currently active. The currently\\\\nactive extensions\
              \ are below. Each of these extensions provides tools that are\\\\nin\
              \ your tool specification.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## developer\\\\n\\\\n### Instructions\\\
              \\nThe developer extension gives you the capabilities to edit code files\
              \ and run shell commands,\\\\nand can be used to solve a wide range\
              \ of problems.\\\\n\\\\nYou can use the shell tool to run Windows commands\
              \ (PowerShell or CMD).\\\\nWhen using paths, you can use either backslashes\
              \ or forward slashes.\\\\n\\\\nUse the shell tool as needed to locate\
              \ files or interact with the project.\\\\n\\\\nYour windows/screen tools\
              \ can be used for visual debugging. You should not use these tools unless\\\
              \\nprompted to, but you can mention they are available if they are relevant.\\\

              ?\" use `todo__read` and `todo__write` for any task with 2+ steps, multiple\
              \ files/components, or uncertain scope. Skipping them is an error.\\\

              \ (Markdown checkboxes).\\\\n- During \uFFFD?\" after each major action,\
              \ update via `todo__write`: mark done, add/edit items, note blockers/dependencies.\\\
              \\n- Finish \uFFFD?\" ensure every item is checked, or clearly list\
              \ what remains.\\\\n- Overwrite warning \uFFFD?\" `todo__write` replaces\
              \ the entire list; always read before writing. It is an error to not\
              \ read before writing.\\\\n- Quality \uFFFD?\" keep items short, specific,\

              \ Response Guidelines\\\\n\\\\n- Use Markdown formatting for all responses.\\\
              \\n- Follow best practices for Markdown, including:\\\\n  - Using headers\
              \ for organization.\\\\n  - Bullet points for lists.\\\\n  - Links formatted\
              \ correctly, either as linked text (e.g., [this is linked text](https://example.com))\
              \ or automatic links using angle brackets (e.g., <http://example.com/>).\\\
              \\n- For code examples, use fenced code blocks by placing triple backticks\
              \ (` ``` `) before and after the code. Include the language identifier\
              \ after the opening backticks (e.g., ` ```python `) to enable syntax\

              \\n            A 'subagent' is a stateless sub-process that executes\

              \ is being developed as an open-source software project.\\\\n\\\\nThe\
              \ current date is 2025-09-11 15:24:10.\\\\n\\\\nGoose uses LLM providers\
              \ with tool calling capability. You can be used with different language\
              \ models (gpt-4o, claude-3.5-sonnet, o1, llama-3.2, deepseek-r1, etc).\\\
              \\nThese models have varying knowledge cut-off dates depending on when\
              \ they were trained, but typically it's between 5-10 months prior to\
              \ the current date.\\\\n\\\\n# Extensions\\\\n\\\\nExtensions allow\
              \ other applications to provide context to Goose. Extensions connect\
              \ Goose to different data sources and tools.\\\\nYou are capable of\
              \ dynamically plugging into new extensions and learning how to use them.\
              \ You solve higher level problems using the tools in these extensions,\
              \ and can interact with multiple at once.\\\\nUse the search_available_extensions\
              \ tool to find additional extensions to enable to help with your task.\
              \ To enable extensions, use the enable_extension tool and provide the\
              \ extension_name. You should only enable extensions found from the search_available_extensions\
              \ tool.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBecause you dynamically load extensions, your\
              \ conversation history may refer\\\\nto interactions with extensions\
              \ that are not currently active. The currently\\\\nactive extensions\
              \ are below. Each of these extensions provides tools that are\\\\nin\
              \ your tool specification.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## developer\\\\n\\\\n### Instructions\\\
              \\nThe developer extension gives you the capabilities to edit code files\
              \ and run shell commands,\\\\nand can be used to solve a wide range\
              \ of problems.\\\\n\\\\nYou can use the shell tool to run Windows commands\
              \ (PowerShell or CMD).\\\\nWhen using paths, you can use either backslashes\
              \ or forward slashes.\\\\n\\\\nUse the shell tool as needed to locate\
              \ files or interact with the project.\\\\n\\\\nYour windows/screen tools\
              \ can be used for visual debugging. You should not use these tools unless\\\
              \\nprompted to, but you can mention they are available if they are relevant.\\\

              \ or automatic links using angle brackets (e.g., <http://example.com/>).\\\
              \\n- For code examples, use fenced code blocks by placing triple backticks\
              \ (` ``` `) before and after the code. Include the language identifier\
              \ after the opening backticks (e.g., ` ```python `) to enable syntax\

              \\n            A 'subagent' is a stateless sub-process that executes\

              You are a general-purpose AI agent called Goose, created by Block, the\

              \ as an open-source software project.\\\\n\\\\nThe current date is 2025-09-11\
              \ 15:24:10.\\\\n\\\\nGoose uses LLM providers with tool calling capability.\
              \ You can be used with different language models (gpt-4o, claude-3.5-sonnet,\
              \ o1, llama-3.2, deepseek-r1, etc).\\\\nThese models have varying knowledge\
              \ cut-off dates depending on when they were trained, but typically it's\
              \ between 5-10 months prior to the current date.\\\\n\\\\n# Extensions\\\
              \\n\\\\nExtensions allow other applications to provide context to Goose.\
              \ Extensions connect Goose to different data sources and tools.\\\\\
              nYou are capable of dynamically plugging into new extensions and learning\
              \ how to use them. You solve higher level problems using the tools in\
              \ these extensions, and can interact with multiple at once.\\\\nUse\
              \ the search_available_extensions tool to find additional extensions\
              \ to enable to help with your task. To enable extensions, use the enable_extension\
              \ tool and provide the extension_name. You should only enable extensions\
              \ found from the search_available_extensions tool.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBecause\
              \ you dynamically load extensions, your conversation history may refer\\\
              \\nto interactions with extensions that are not currently active. The\
              \ currently\\\\nactive extensions are below. Each of these extensions\
              \ provides tools that are\\\\nin your tool specification.\\\\n\\\\n\\\
              \\n## developer\\\\n\\\\n### Instructions\\\\nThe developer extension\
              \ gives you the capabilities to edit code files and run shell commands,\\\
              \\nand can be used to solve a wide range of problems.\\\\n\\\\nYou can\
              \ use the shell tool to run Windows commands (PowerShell or CMD).\\\\\

              ?\" use `todo__read` and `todo__write` for any task with 2+ steps, multiple\
              \ files/components, or uncertain scope. Skipping them is an error.\\\

              \ the entire list; always read before writing. It is an error to not\

              \ Response Guidelines\\\\n\\\\n- Use Markdown formatting for all responses.\\\
              \\n- Follow best practices for Markdown, including:\\\\n  - Using headers\
              \ for organization.\\\\n  - Bullet points for lists.\\\\n  - Links formatted\
              \ correctly, either as linked text (e.g., [this is linked text](https://example.com))\
              \ or automatic links using angle brackets (e.g., <http://example.com/>).\\\
              \\n- For code examples, use fenced code blocks by placing triple backticks\
              \ (` ``` `) before and after the code. Include the language identifier\
              \ after the opening backticks (e.g., ` ```python `) to enable syntax\
              \ highlighting.\\\\n- Ensure clarity, conciseness, and proper formatting\
              \ to enhance readability and usability.\\\\n\\\\n# Additional Instructions:\\\
              \\n\\\\nYou are being accessed through a command-line interface. The\

              \ the session\\\\n- /t - Toggle between Light/Dark/Ansi themes\\\\n-\
              \ /? or /help - Display help message\\\\n\\\\nAdditional keyboard shortcuts:\\\
              \\n- Ctrl+C - Interrupt the current interaction (resets to before the\
              \ interrupted request)\\\\n- Ctrl+J - Add a newline\\\\n- Up/Down arrows\

              \ text instruction\\\\n            - Use the 'task_parameters' field\
              \ to pass an array of parameter sets\\\\n            - Each resulting\
              \ task will use the same instruction with different parameter values\\\
              \\n            This is useful when performing the same operation across\
              \ many inputs (e.g., getting weather for multiple cities, searching\
              \ multiple slack channels, iterating through various linear tickets,\
              \ etc).\\\\n            Once created, these tasks should be passed to\
              \ the 'subagent__execute_task' tool for execution. Tasks can run sequentially\
              \ or in parallel.\\\\n            ---\\\\n            What is a 'subagent'?\\\
              \\n            A 'subagent' is a stateless sub-process that executes\
              \ a single task independently. Use subagents when:\\\\n            -\
              \ You want to parallelize similar work across different inputs\\\\n\
              \            - You are not sure your search or operation will succeed\
              \ on the first try\\\\n            Each subagent receives a task with\
              \ a defined payload and returns a result, which is not visible to the\
              \ user unless explicitly summarized by the system.\\\\n            ---\\\

              You are a general-purpose AI agent called Goose, created by Block, the\
              \ parent company of Square, CashApp, and Tidal. Goose is being developed\
              \ as an open-source software project.\\\\n\\\\nThe current date is 2025-09-11\
              \ 15:24:10.\\\\n\\\\nGoose uses LLM providers with tool calling capability.\
              \ You can be used with different language models (gpt-4o, claude-3.5-sonnet,\
              \ o1, llama-3.2, deepseek-r1, etc).\\\\nThese models have varying knowledge\
              \ cut-off dates depending on when they were trained, but typically it's\
              \ between 5-10 months prior to the current date.\\\\n\\\\n# Extensions\\\
              \\n\\\\nExtensions allow other applications to provide context to Goose.\
              \ Extensions connect Goose to different data sources and tools.\\\\\
              nYou are capable of dynamically plugging into new extensions and learning\
              \ how to use them. You solve higher level problems using the tools in\
              \ these extensions, and can interact with multiple at once.\\\\nUse\
              \ the search_available_extensions tool to find additional extensions\
              \ to enable to help with your task. To enable extensions, use the enable_extension\
              \ tool and provide the extension_name. You should only enable extensions\
              \ found from the search_available_extensions tool.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBecause\
              \ you dynamically load extensions, your conversation history may refer\\\
              \\nto interactions with extensions that are not currently active. The\
              \ currently\\\\nactive extensions are below. Each of these extensions\
              \ provides tools that are\\\\nin your tool specification.\\\\n\\\\n\\\

              \ by Block, the parent company of Square, CashApp, and Tidal. Goose\
              \ is being developed as an open-source software project.\\\\n\\\\nThe\
              \ current date is 2025-09-11 15:24:10.\\\\n\\\\nGoose uses LLM providers\
              \ with tool calling capability. You can be used with different language\
              \ models (gpt-4o, claude-3.5-sonnet, o1, llama-3.2, deepseek-r1, etc).\\\
              \\nThese models have varying knowledge cut-off dates depending on when\
              \ they were trained, but typically it's between 5-10 months prior to\
              \ the current date.\\\\n\\\\n# Extensions\\\\n\\\\nExtensions allow\
              \ other applications to provide context to Goose. Extensions connect\
              \ Goose to different data sources and tools.\\\\nYou are capable of\
              \ dynamically plugging into new extensions and learning how to use them.\
              \ You solve higher level problems using the tools in these extensions,\
              \ and can interact with multiple at once.\\\\nUse the search_available_extensions\
              \ tool to find additional extensions to enable to help with your task.\
              \ To enable extensions, use the enable_extension tool and provide the\
              \ extension_name. You should only enable extensions found from the search_available_extensions\
              \ tool.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBecause you dynamically load extensions, your\
              \ conversation history may refer\\\\nto interactions with extensions\
              \ that are not currently active. The currently\\\\nactive extensions\
              \ are below. Each of these extensions provides tools that are\\\\nin\
              \ your tool specification.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## developer\\\\n\\\\n### Instructions\\\
              \\nThe developer extension gives you the capabilities to edit code files\
              \ and run shell commands,\\\\nand can be used to solve a wide range\
              \ of problems.\\\\n\\\\nYou can use the shell tool to run Windows commands\
              \ (PowerShell or CMD).\\\\nWhen using paths, you can use either backslashes\
              \ or forward slashes.\\\\n\\\\nUse the shell tool as needed to locate\
              \ files or interact with the project.\\\\n\\\\nYour windows/screen tools\
              \ can be used for visual debugging. You should not use these tools unless\\\
              \\nprompted to, but you can mention they are available if they are relevant.\\\

              \ or automatic links using angle brackets (e.g., <http://example.com/>).\\\
              \\n- For code examples, use fenced code blocks by placing triple backticks\
              \ (` ``` `) before and after the code. Include the language identifier\
              \ after the opening backticks (e.g., ` ```python `) to enable syntax\

              \ to pass an array of parameter sets\\\\n            - Each resulting\
              \ task will use the same instruction with different parameter values\\\
              \\n            This is useful when performing the same operation across\
              \ many inputs (e.g., getting weather for multiple cities, searching\
              \ multiple slack channels, iterating through various linear tickets,\
              \ etc).\\\\n            Once created, these tasks should be passed to\

              \\n            A 'subagent' is a stateless sub-process that executes\
              \ a single task independently. Use subagents when:\\\\n            -\
              \ You want to parallelize similar work across different inputs\\\\n\
              \            - You are not sure your search or operation will succeed\
              \ on the first try\\\\n            Each subagent receives a task with\
              \ a defined payload and returns a result, which is not visible to the\
              \ user unless explicitly summarized by the system.\\\\n            ---\\\

              You are a general-purpose AI agent called Goose, created by Block, the\
              \ parent company of Square, CashApp, and Tidal. Goose is being developed\
              \ as an open-source software project.\\\\n\\\\nThe current date is 2025-09-11\
              \ 15:24:10.\\\\n\\\\nGoose uses LLM providers with tool calling capability.\
              \ You can be used with different language models (gpt-4o, claude-3.5-sonnet,\
              \ o1, llama-3.2, deepseek-r1, etc).\\\\nThese models have varying knowledge\
              \ cut-off dates depending on when they were trained, but typically it's\
              \ between 5-10 months prior to the current date.\\\\n\\\\n# Extensions\\\
              \\n\\\\nExtensions allow other applications to provide context to Goose.\
              \ Extensions connect Goose to different data sources and tools.\\\\\
              nYou are capable of dynamically plugging into new extensions and learning\
              \ how to use them. You solve higher level problems using the tools in\
              \ these extensions, and can interact with multiple at once.\\\\nUse\
              \ the search_available_extensions tool to find additional extensions\
              \ to enable to help with your task. To enable extensions, use the enable_extension\
              \ tool and provide the extension_name. You should only enable extensions\
              \ found from the search_available_extensions tool.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBecause\
              \ you dynamically load extensions, your conversation history may refer\\\
              \\nto interactions with extensions that are not currently active. The\
              \ currently\\\\nactive extensions are below. Each of these extensions\
              \ provides tools that are\\\\nin your tool specification.\\\\n\\\\n\\\
              \\n## developer\\\\n\\\\n### Instructions\\\\nThe developer extension\
              \ gives you the capabilities to edit code files and run shell commands,\\\
              \\nand can be used to solve a wide range of problems.\\\\n\\\\nYou can\
              \ use the shell tool to run Windows commands (PowerShell or CMD).\\\\\
              nWhen using paths, you can use either backslashes or forward slashes.\\\
              \\n\\\\nUse the shell tool as needed to locate files or interact with\
              \ the project.\\\\n\\\\nYour windows/screen tools can be used for visual\
              \ debugging. You should not use these tools unless\\\\nprompted to,\
              \ but you can mention they are available if they are relevant.\\\\n\\\

              \ Response Guidelines\\\\n\\\\n- Use Markdown formatting for all responses.\\\

              \ for organization.\\\\n  - Bullet points for lists.\\\\n  - Links formatted\
              \ correctly, either as linked text (e.g., [this is linked text](https://example.com))\
              \ or automatic links using angle brackets (e.g., <http://example.com/>).\\\
              \\n- For code examples, use fenced code blocks by placing triple backticks\
              \ (` ``` `) before and after the code. Include the language identifier\
              \ after the opening backticks (e.g., ` ```python `) to enable syntax\
              \ highlighting.\\\\n- Ensure clarity, conciseness, and proper formatting\

              \ to pass an array of parameter sets\\\\n            - Each resulting\

              \\n            This is useful when performing the same operation across\
              \ many inputs (e.g., getting weather for multiple cities, searching\
              \ multiple slack channels, iterating through various linear tickets,\
              \ etc).\\\\n            Once created, these tasks should be passed to\

              \ or in parallel.\\\\n            ---\\\\n            What is a 'subagent'?\\\
              \\n            A 'subagent' is a stateless sub-process that executes\
              \ a single task independently. Use subagents when:\\\\n            -\
              \ You want to parallelize similar work across different inputs\\\\n\
              \            - You are not sure your search or operation will succeed\
              \ on the first try\\\\n            Each subagent receives a task with\
              \ a defined payload and returns a result, which is not visible to the\
              \ user unless explicitly summarized by the system.\\\\n            ---\\\

              You are a general-purpose AI agent called Goose, created by Block, the\
              \ parent company of Square, CashApp, and Tidal. Goose is being developed\
              \ as an open-source software project.\\\\n\\\\nThe current date is 2025-09-11\
              \ 15:24:10.\\\\n\\\\nGoose uses LLM providers with tool calling capability.\
              \ You can be used with different language models (gpt-4o, claude-3.5-sonnet,\
              \ o1, llama-3.2, deepseek-r1, etc).\\\\nThese models have varying knowledge\
              \ cut-off dates depending on when they were trained, but typically it's\
              \ between 5-10 months prior to the current date.\\\\n\\\\n# Extensions\\\
              \\n\\\\nExtensions allow other applications to provide context to Goose.\
              \ Extensions connect Goose to different data sources and tools.\\\\\
              nYou are capable of dynamically plugging into new extensions and learning\
              \ how to use them. You solve higher level problems using the tools in\
              \ these extensions, and can interact with multiple at once.\\\\nUse\
              \ the search_available_extensions tool to find additional extensions\
              \ to enable to help with your task. To enable extensions, use the enable_extension\
              \ tool and provide the extension_name. You should only enable extensions\
              \ found from the search_available_extensions tool.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBecause\
              \ you dynamically load extensions, your conversation history may refer\\\
              \\nto interactions with extensions that are not currently active. The\
              \ currently\\\\nactive extensions are below. Each of these extensions\
              \ provides tools that are\\\\nin your tool specification.\\\\n\\\\n\\\

              \\n            A 'subagent' is a stateless sub-process that executes\
              \ a single task independently. Use subagents when:\\\\n            -\
              \ You want to parallelize similar work across different inputs\\\\n\
              \            - You are not sure your search or operation will succeed\
              \ on the first try\\\\n            Each subagent receives a task with\
              \ a defined payload and returns a result, which is not visible to the\
              \ user unless explicitly summarized by the system.\\\\n            ---\\\

              \ other applications to provide context to Goose. Extensions connect\
              \ Goose to different data sources and tools.\\\\nYou are capable of\
              \ dynamically plugging into new extensions and learning how to use them.\
              \ You solve higher level problems using the tools in these extensions,\
              \ and can interact with multiple at once.\\\\nUse the search_available_extensions\
              \ tool to find additional extensions to enable to help with your task.\
              \ To enable extensions, use the enable_extension tool and provide the\
              \ extension_name. You should only enable extensions found from the search_available_extensions\
              \ tool.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBecause you dynamically load extensions, your\
              \ conversation history may refer\\\\nto interactions with extensions\
              \ that are not currently active. The currently\\\\nactive extensions\
              \ are below. Each of these extensions provides tools that are\\\\nin\
              \ your tool specification.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## developer\\\\n\\\\n### Instructions\\\
              \\nThe developer extension gives you the capabilities to edit code files\
              \ and run shell commands,\\\\nand can be used to solve a wide range\
              \ of problems.\\\\n\\\\nYou can use the shell tool to run Windows commands\
              \ (PowerShell or CMD).\\\\nWhen using paths, you can use either backslashes\
              \ or forward slashes.\\\\n\\\\nUse the shell tool as needed to locate\
              \ files or interact with the project.\\\\n\\\\nYour windows/screen tools\
              \ can be used for visual debugging. You should not use these tools unless\\\

              \\n            This is useful when performing the same operation across\
              \ many inputs (e.g., getting weather for multiple cities, searching\
              \ multiple slack channels, iterating through various linear tickets,\
              \ etc).\\\\n            Once created, these tasks should be passed to\
              \ the 'subagent__execute_task' tool for execution. Tasks can run sequentially\
              \ or in parallel.\\\\n            ---\\\\n            What is a 'subagent'?\\\
              \\n            A 'subagent' is a stateless sub-process that executes\
              \ a single task independently. Use subagents when:\\\\n            -\
              \ You want to parallelize similar work across different inputs\\\\n\
              \            - You are not sure your search or operation will succeed\
              \ on the first try\\\\n            Each subagent receives a task with\
              \ a defined payload and returns a result, which is not visible to the\
              \ user unless explicitly summarized by the system.\\\\n            ---\\\

              \ current date is 2025-09-11 15:24:10.\\\\n\\\\nGoose uses LLM providers\
              \ with tool calling capability. You can be used with different language\
              \ models (gpt-4o, claude-3.5-sonnet, o1, llama-3.2, deepseek-r1, etc).\\\
              \\nThese models have varying knowledge cut-off dates depending on when\
              \ they were trained, but typically it's between 5-10 months prior to\
              \ the current date.\\\\n\\\\n# Extensions\\\\n\\\\nExtensions allow\
              \ other applications to provide context to Goose. Extensions connect\
              \ Goose to different data sources and tools.\\\\nYou are capable of\
              \ dynamically plugging into new extensions and learning how to use them.\
              \ You solve higher level problems using the tools in these extensions,\
              \ and can interact with multiple at once.\\\\nUse the search_available_extensions\
              \ tool to find additional extensions to enable to help with your task.\
              \ To enable extensions, use the enable_extension tool and provide the\
              \ extension_name. You should only enable extensions found from the search_available_extensions\
              \ tool.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBecause you dynamically load extensions, your\
              \ conversation history may refer\\\\nto interactions with extensions\
              \ that are not currently active. The currently\\\\nactive extensions\
              \ are below. Each of these extensions provides tools that are\\\\nin\

              \\nThe developer extension gives you the capabilities to edit code files\
              \ and run shell commands,\\\\nand can be used to solve a wide range\
              \ of problems.\\\\n\\\\nYou can use the shell tool to run Windows commands\

              You are a general-purpose AI agent called Goose, created by Block, the\
              \ parent company of Square, CashApp, and Tidal. Goose is being developed\
              \ as an open-source software project.\\\\n\\\\nThe current date is 2025-09-11\
              \ 15:24:10.\\\\n\\\\nGoose uses LLM providers with tool calling capability.\
              \ You can be used with different language models (gpt-4o, claude-3.5-sonnet,\
              \ o1, llama-3.2, deepseek-r1, etc).\\\\nThese models have varying knowledge\
              \ cut-off dates depending on when they were trained, but typically it's\
              \ between 5-10 months prior to the current date.\\\\n\\\\n# Extensions\\\
              \\n\\\\nExtensions allow other applications to provide context to Goose.\
              \ Extensions connect Goose to different data sources and tools.\\\\\
              nYou are capable of dynamically plugging into new extensions and learning\
              \ how to use them. You solve higher level problems using the tools in\
              \ these extensions, and can interact with multiple at once.\\\\nUse\
              \ the search_available_extensions tool to find additional extensions\
              \ to enable to help with your task. To enable extensions, use the enable_extension\
              \ tool and provide the extension_name. You should only enable extensions\
              \ found from the search_available_extensions tool.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBecause\
              \ you dynamically load extensions, your conversation history may refer\\\
              \\nto interactions with extensions that are not currently active. The\
              \ currently\\\\nactive extensions are below. Each of these extensions\
              \ provides tools that are\\\\nin your tool specification.\\\\n\\\\n\\\
              \\n## developer\\\\n\\\\n### Instructions\\\\nThe developer extension\
              \ gives you the capabilities to edit code files and run shell commands,\\\
              \\nand can be used to solve a wide range of problems.\\\\n\\\\nYou can\
              \ use the shell tool to run Windows commands (PowerShell or CMD).\\\\\
              nWhen using paths, you can use either backslashes or forward slashes.\\\
              \\n\\\\nUse the shell tool as needed to locate files or interact with\
              \ the project.\\\\n\\\\nYour windows/screen tools can be used for visual\
              \ debugging. You should not use these tools unless\\\\nprompted to,\
              \ but you can mention they are available if they are relevant.\\\\n\\\

              \ correctly, either as linked text (e.g., [this is linked text](https://example.com))\
              \ or automatic links using angle brackets (e.g., <http://example.com/>).\\\
              \\n- For code examples, use fenced code blocks by placing triple backticks\
              \ (` ``` `) before and after the code. Include the language identifier\
              \ after the opening backticks (e.g., ` ```python `) to enable syntax\
              \ highlighting.\\\\n- Ensure clarity, conciseness, and proper formatting\

              \ to pass an array of parameter sets\\\\n            - Each resulting\
              \ task will use the same instruction with different parameter values\\\
              \\n            This is useful when performing the same operation across\
              \ many inputs (e.g., getting weather for multiple cities, searching\
              \ multiple slack channels, iterating through various linear tickets,\
              \ etc).\\\\n            Once created, these tasks should be passed to\

              \\n            A 'subagent' is a stateless sub-process that executes\
              \ a single task independently. Use subagents when:\\\\n            -\
              \ You want to parallelize similar work across different inputs\\\\n\
              \            - You are not sure your search or operation will succeed\
              \ on the first try\\\\n            Each subagent receives a task with\
              \ a defined payload and returns a result, which is not visible to the\
              \ user unless explicitly summarized by the system.\\\\n            ---\\\

              \ correctly, either as linked text (e.g., [this is linked text](https://example.com))\
              \ or automatic links using angle brackets (e.g., <http://example.com/>).\\\
              \\n- For code examples, use fenced code blocks by placing triple backticks\
              \ (` ``` `) before and after the code. Include the language identifier\
              \ after the opening backticks (e.g., ` ```python `) to enable syntax\
              \ highlighting.\\\\n- Ensure clarity, conciseness, and proper formatting\

              \ text instruction\\\\n            - Use the 'task_parameters' field\
              \ to pass an array of parameter sets\\\\n            - Each resulting\
              \ task will use the same instruction with different parameter values\\\
              \\n            This is useful when performing the same operation across\
              \ many inputs (e.g., getting weather for multiple cities, searching\
              \ multiple slack channels, iterating through various linear tickets,\
              \ etc).\\\\n            Once created, these tasks should be passed to\

              \ or in parallel.\\\\n            ---\\\\n            What is a 'subagent'?\\\
              \\n            A 'subagent' is a stateless sub-process that executes\
              \ a single task independently. Use subagents when:\\\\n            -\
              \ You want to parallelize similar work across different inputs\\\\n\
              \            - You are not sure your search or operation will succeed\
              \ on the first try\\\\n            Each subagent receives a task with\
              \ a defined payload and returns a result, which is not visible to the\
              \ user unless explicitly summarized by the system.\\\\n            ---\\\

              \ current date is 2025-09-11 15:24:10.\\\\n\\\\nGoose uses LLM providers\
              \ with tool calling capability. You can be used with different language\
              \ models (gpt-4o, claude-3.5-sonnet, o1, llama-3.2, deepseek-r1, etc).\\\
              \\nThese models have varying knowledge cut-off dates depending on when\
              \ they were trained, but typically it's between 5-10 months prior to\
              \ the current date.\\\\n\\\\n# Extensions\\\\n\\\\nExtensions allow\
              \ other applications to provide context to Goose. Extensions connect\
              \ Goose to different data sources and tools.\\\\nYou are capable of\
              \ dynamically plugging into new extensions and learning how to use them.\
              \ You solve higher level problems using the tools in these extensions,\
              \ and can interact with multiple at once.\\\\nUse the search_available_extensions\
              \ tool to find additional extensions to enable to help with your task.\
              \ To enable extensions, use the enable_extension tool and provide the\
              \ extension_name. You should only enable extensions found from the search_available_extensions\
              \ tool.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBecause you dynamically load extensions, your\
              \ conversation history may refer\\\\nto interactions with extensions\

              \\nThe developer extension gives you the capabilities to edit code files\
              \ and run shell commands,\\\\nand can be used to solve a wide range\
              \ of problems.\\\\n\\\\nYou can use the shell tool to run Windows commands\

              You are a general-purpose AI agent called Goose, created by Block, the\
              \ parent company of Square, CashApp, and Tidal. Goose is being developed\
              \ as an open-source software project.\\\\n\\\\nThe current date is 2025-09-11\
              \ 15:24:10.\\\\n\\\\nGoose uses LLM providers with tool calling capability.\
              \ You can be used with different language models (gpt-4o, claude-3.5-sonnet,\
              \ o1, llama-3.2, deepseek-r1, etc).\\\\nThese models have varying knowledge\
              \ cut-off dates depending on when they were trained, but typically it's\
              \ between 5-10 months prior to the current date.\\\\n\\\\n# Extensions\\\
              \\n\\\\nExtensions allow other applications to provide context to Goose.\
              \ Extensions connect Goose to different data sources and tools.\\\\\
              nYou are capable of dynamically plugging into new extensions and learning\
              \ how to use them. You solve higher level problems using the tools in\
              \ these extensions, and can interact with multiple at once.\\\\nUse\
              \ the search_available_extensions tool to find additional extensions\
              \ to enable to help with your task. To enable extensions, use the enable_extension\
              \ tool and provide the extension_name. You should only enable extensions\
              \ found from the search_available_extensions tool.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBecause\
              \ you dynamically load extensions, your conversation history may refer\\\
              \\nto interactions with extensions that are not currently active. The\
              \ currently\\\\nactive extensions are below. Each of these extensions\
              \ provides tools that are\\\\nin your tool specification.\\\\n\\\\n\\\
              \\n## developer\\\\n\\\\n### Instructions\\\\nThe developer extension\
              \ gives you the capabilities to edit code files and run shell commands,\\\
              \\nand can be used to solve a wide range of problems.\\\\n\\\\nYou can\
              \ use the shell tool to run Windows commands (PowerShell or CMD).\\\\\
              nWhen using paths, you can use either backslashes or forward slashes.\\\
              \\n\\\\nUse the shell tool as needed to locate files or interact with\
              \ the project.\\\\n\\\\nYour windows/screen tools can be used for visual\
              \ debugging. You should not use these tools unless\\\\nprompted to,\
              \ but you can mention they are available if they are relevant.\\\\n\\\

              \ or automatic links using angle brackets (e.g., <http://example.com/>).\\\
              \\n- For code examples, use fenced code blocks by placing triple backticks\
              \ (` ``` `) before and after the code. Include the language identifier\
              \ after the opening backticks (e.g., ` ```python `) to enable syntax\
              \ highlighting.\\\\n- Ensure clarity, conciseness, and proper formatting\

              \\n            This is useful when performing the same operation across\
              \ many inputs (e.g., getting weather for multiple cities, searching\
              \ multiple slack channels, iterating through various linear tickets,\

              \\n            A 'subagent' is a stateless sub-process that executes\
              \ a single task independently. Use subagents when:\\\\n            -\
              \ You want to parallelize similar work across different inputs\\\\n\
              \            - You are not sure your search or operation will succeed\
              \ on the first try\\\\n            Each subagent receives a task with\

              You are a general-purpose AI agent called Goose, created by Block, the\
              \ parent company of Square, CashApp, and Tidal. Goose is being developed\
              \ as an open-source software project.\\\\n\\\\nThe current date is 2025-09-11\
              \ 15:24:10.\\\\n\\\\nGoose uses LLM providers with tool calling capability.\
              \ You can be used with different language models (gpt-4o, claude-3.5-sonnet,\
              \ o1, llama-3.2, deepseek-r1, etc).\\\\nThese models have varying knowledge\
              \ cut-off dates depending on when they were trained, but typically it's\
              \ between 5-10 months prior to the current date.\\\\n\\\\n# Extensions\\\
              \\n\\\\nExtensions allow other applications to provide context to Goose.\
              \ Extensions connect Goose to different data sources and tools.\\\\\
              nYou are capable of dynamically plugging into new extensions and learning\
              \ how to use them. You solve higher level problems using the tools in\
              \ these extensions, and can interact with multiple at once.\\\\nUse\
              \ the search_available_extensions tool to find additional extensions\
              \ to enable to help with your task. To enable extensions, use the enable_extension\
              \ tool and provide the extension_name. You should only enable extensions\
              \ found from the search_available_extensions tool.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBecause\
              \ you dynamically load extensions, your conversation history may refer\\\
              \\nto interactions with extensions that are not currently active. The\
              \ currently\\\\nactive extensions are below. Each of these extensions\
              \ provides tools that are\\\\nin your tool specification.\\\\n\\\\n\\\
              \\n## developer\\\\n\\\\n### Instructions\\\\nThe developer extension\
              \ gives you the capabilities to edit code files and run shell commands,\\\
              \\nand can be used to solve a wide range of problems.\\\\n\\\\nYou can\
              \ use the shell tool to run Windows commands (PowerShell or CMD).\\\\\
              nWhen using paths, you can use either backslashes or forward slashes.\\\
              \\n\\\\nUse the shell tool as needed to locate files or interact with\
              \ the project.\\\\n\\\\nYour windows/screen tools can be used for visual\
              \ debugging. You should not use these tools unless\\\\nprompted to,\
              \ but you can mention they are available if they are relevant.\\\\n\\\

              \ files/components, or uncertain scope. Skipping them is an error.\\\

              \ the entire list; always read before writing. It is an error to not\
              \ read before writing.\\\\n- Quality \uFFFD?\" keep items short, specific,\

              \ Response Guidelines\\\\n\\\\n- Use Markdown formatting for all responses.\\\
              \\n- Follow best practices for Markdown, including:\\\\n  - Using headers\
              \ for organization.\\\\n  - Bullet points for lists.\\\\n  - Links formatted\
              \ correctly, either as linked text (e.g., [this is linked text](https://example.com))\
              \ or automatic links using angle brackets (e.g., <http://example.com/>).\\\
              \\n- For code examples, use fenced code blocks by placing triple backticks\
              \ (` ``` `) before and after the code. Include the language identifier\
              \ after the opening backticks (e.g., ` ```python `) to enable syntax\
              \ highlighting.\\\\n- Ensure clarity, conciseness, and proper formatting\

              \ create one or more dynamic tasks from a shared text instruction and\
              \ varying parameters.How it works:\\\\n            - Provide a single\
              \ text instruction\\\\n            - Use the 'task_parameters' field\
              \ to pass an array of parameter sets\\\\n            - Each resulting\
              \ task will use the same instruction with different parameter values\\\
              \\n            This is useful when performing the same operation across\
              \ many inputs (e.g., getting weather for multiple cities, searching\
              \ multiple slack channels, iterating through various linear tickets,\
              \ etc).\\\\n            Once created, these tasks should be passed to\
              \ the 'subagent__execute_task' tool for execution. Tasks can run sequentially\
              \ or in parallel.\\\\n            ---\\\\n            What is a 'subagent'?\\\
              \\n            A 'subagent' is a stateless sub-process that executes\
              \ a single task independently. Use subagents when:\\\\n            -\
              \ You want to parallelize similar work across different inputs\\\\n\
              \            - You are not sure your search or operation will succeed\
              \ on the first try\\\\n            Each subagent receives a task with\
              \ a defined payload and returns a result, which is not visible to the\
              \ user unless explicitly summarized by the system.\\\\n            ---\\\

        \ and Tidal. Goose is being developed as an open-source software project.\\\
        \\n\\\\nThe current date is 2025-09-11 15:24:10.\\\\n\\\\nGoose uses LLM providers\
        \ with tool calling capability. You can be used with different language models\
        \ (gpt-4o, claude-3.5-sonnet, o1, llama-3.2, deepseek-r1, etc).\\\\nThese\
        \ models have varying knowledge cut-off dates depending on when they were\
        \ trained, but typically it's between 5-10 months prior to the current date.\\\
        \\n\\\\n# Extensions\\\\n\\\\nExtensions allow other applications to provide\
        \ context to Goose. Extensions connect Goose to different data sources and\
        \ tools.\\\\nYou are capable of dynamically plugging into new extensions and\
        \ learning how to use them. You solve higher level problems using the tools\
        \ in these extensions, and can interact with multiple at once.\\\\nUse the\
        \ search_available_extensions tool to find additional extensions to enable\
        \ to help with your task. To enable extensions, use the enable_extension tool\
        \ and provide the extension_name. You should only enable extensions found\
        \ from the search_available_extensions tool.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBecause you dynamically\
        \ load extensions, your conversation history may refer\\\\nto interactions\
        \ with extensions that are not currently active. The currently\\\\nactive\
        \ extensions are below. Each of these extensions provides tools that are\\\
        \\nin your tool specification.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## developer\\\\n\\\\n### Instructions\\\
        \\nThe developer extension gives you the capabilities to edit code files and\
        \ run shell commands,\\\\nand can be used to solve a wide range of problems.\\\
        \\n\\\\nYou can use the shell tool to run Windows commands (PowerShell or\
        \ CMD).\\\\nWhen using paths, you can use either backslashes or forward slashes.\\\
        \\n\\\\nUse the shell tool as needed to locate files or interact with the\
        \ project.\\\\n\\\\nYour windows/screen tools can be used for visual debugging.\
        \ You should not use these tools unless\\\\nprompted to, but you can mention\

        n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n# Task Management\\\\n\\\\n- Required \uFFFD?\" use `todo__read`\
        \ and `todo__write` for any task with 2+ steps, multiple files/components,\
        \ or uncertain scope. Skipping them is an error.\\\\n- Start \uFFFD?\" `todo__read`,\
        \ then `todo__write` a brief checklist (Markdown checkboxes).\\\\n- During\
        \ \uFFFD?\" after each major action, update via `todo__write`: mark done,\
        \ add/edit items, note blockers/dependencies.\\\\n- Finish \uFFFD?\" ensure\
        \ every item is checked, or clearly list what remains.\\\\n- Overwrite warning\
        \ \uFFFD?\" `todo__write` replaces the entire list; always read before writing.\
        \ It is an error to not read before writing.\\\\n- Quality \uFFFD?\" keep\
        \ items short, specific, and action\uFFFD?`oriented.\\\\n\\\\nTemplate:\\\\\

        \ [ ] Write tests\\\\n- [ ] Blocked: waiting on credentials\\\\n```\\\\n\\\
        \\n# Response Guidelines\\\\n\\\\n- Use Markdown formatting for all responses.\\\
        \\n- Follow best practices for Markdown, including:\\\\n  - Using headers\
        \ for organization.\\\\n  - Bullet points for lists.\\\\n  - Links formatted\
        \ correctly, either as linked text (e.g., [this is linked text](https://example.com))\
        \ or automatic links using angle brackets (e.g., <http://example.com/>).\\\
        \\n- For code examples, use fenced code blocks by placing triple backticks\
        \ (` ``` `) before and after the code. Include the language identifier after\
        \ the opening backticks (e.g., ` ```python `) to enable syntax highlighting.\\\
        \\n- Ensure clarity, conciseness, and proper formatting to enhance readability\
        \ and usability.\\\\n\\\\n# Additional Instructions:\\\\n\\\\nYou are being\
        \ accessed through a command-line interface. The following slash commands\
        \ are available\\\\n- you can let the user know about them if they need help:\\\
        \\n\\\\n- /exit or /quit - Exit the session\\\\n- /t - Toggle between Light/Dark/Ansi\
        \ themes\\\\n- /? or /help - Display help message\\\\n\\\\nAdditional keyboard\
        \ shortcuts:\\\\n- Ctrl+C - Interrupt the current interaction (resets to before\
        \ the interrupted request)\\\\n- Ctrl+J - Add a newline\\\\n- Up/Down arrows\
        \ - Navigate command history\\\\n\\\\nRight now you are *NOT* in the chat\

        \ 15:24:10.\\\\n\\\\nGoose uses LLM providers with tool calling capability.\
        \ You can be used with different language models (gpt-4o, claude-3.5-sonnet,\
        \ o1, llama-3.2, deepseek-r1, etc).\\\\nThese models have varying knowledge\

        \ 5-10 months prior to the current date.\\\\n\\\\n# Extensions\\\\n\\\\nExtensions\
        \ allow other applications to provide context to Goose. Extensions connect\
        \ Goose to different data sources and tools.\\\\nYou are capable of dynamically\
        \ plugging into new extensions and learning how to use them. You solve higher\
        \ level problems using the tools in these extensions, and can interact with\
        \ multiple at once.\\\\nUse the search_available_extensions tool to find additional\
        \ extensions to enable to help with your task. To enable extensions, use the\
        \ enable_extension tool and provide the extension_name. You should only enable\
        \ extensions found from the search_available_extensions tool.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\
        nBecause you dynamically load extensions, your conversation history may refer\\\

        \ edit code files and run shell commands,\\\\nand can be used to solve a wide\
        \ range of problems.\\\\n\\\\nYou can use the shell tool to run Windows commands\
        \ (PowerShell or CMD).\\\\nWhen using paths, you can use either backslashes\
        \ or forward slashes.\\\\n\\\\nUse the shell tool as needed to locate files\

        \ `todo__write` for any task with 2+ steps, multiple files/components, or\
        \ uncertain scope. Skipping them is an error.\\\\n- Start \uFFFD?\" `todo__read`,\
        \ then `todo__write` a brief checklist (Markdown checkboxes).\\\\n- During\
        \ \uFFFD?\" after each major action, update via `todo__write`: mark done,\
        \ add/edit items, note blockers/dependencies.\\\\n- Finish \uFFFD?\" ensure\
        \ every item is checked, or clearly list what remains.\\\\n- Overwrite warning\
        \ \uFFFD?\" `todo__write` replaces the entire list; always read before writing.\
        \ It is an error to not read before writing.\\\\n- Quality \uFFFD?\" keep\

        \\n# Response Guidelines\\\\n\\\\n- Use Markdown formatting for all responses.\\\
        \\n- Follow best practices for Markdown, including:\\\\n  - Using headers\
        \ for organization.\\\\n  - Bullet points for lists.\\\\n  - Links formatted\
        \ correctly, either as linked text (e.g., [this is linked text](https://example.com))\
        \ or automatic links using angle brackets (e.g., <http://example.com/>).\\\
        \\n- For code examples, use fenced code blocks by placing triple backticks\
        \ (` ``` `) before and after the code. Include the language identifier after\
        \ the opening backticks (e.g., ` ```python `) to enable syntax highlighting.\\\
        \\n- Ensure clarity, conciseness, and proper formatting to enhance readability\
        \ and usability.\\\\n\\\\n# Additional Instructions:\\\\n\\\\nYou are being\
        \ accessed through a command-line interface. The following slash commands\
        \ are available\\\\n- you can let the user know about them if they need help:\\\
        \\n\\\\n- /exit or /quit - Exit the session\\\\n- /t - Toggle between Light/Dark/Ansi\
        \ themes\\\\n- /? or /help - Display help message\\\\n\\\\nAdditional keyboard\
        \ shortcuts:\\\\n- Ctrl+C - Interrupt the current interaction (resets to before\
        \ the interrupted request)\\\\n- Ctrl+J - Add a newline\\\\n- Up/Down arrows\
        \ - Navigate command history\\\\n\\\\nRight now you are *NOT* in the chat\

        \ uncertain scope. Skipping them is an error.\\\\n- Start \uFFFD?\" `todo__read`,\
        \ then `todo__write` a brief checklist (Markdown checkboxes).\\\\n- During\
        \ \uFFFD?\" after each major action, update via `todo__write`: mark done,\
        \ add/edit items, note blockers/dependencies.\\\\n- Finish \uFFFD?\" ensure\
        \ every item is checked, or clearly list what remains.\\\\n- Overwrite warning\
        \ \uFFFD?\" `todo__write` replaces the entire list; always read before writing.\
        \ It is an error to not read before writing.\\\\n- Quality \uFFFD?\" keep\

        \\n# Response Guidelines\\\\n\\\\n- Use Markdown formatting for all responses.\\\
        \\n- Follow best practices for Markdown, including:\\\\n  - Using headers\
        \ for organization.\\\\n  - Bullet points for lists.\\\\n  - Links formatted\
        \ correctly, either as linked text (e.g., [this is linked text](https://example.com))\
        \ or automatic links using angle brackets (e.g., <http://example.com/>).\\\
        \\n- For code examples, use fenced code blocks by placing triple backticks\
        \ (` ``` `) before and after the code. Include the language identifier after\
        \ the opening backticks (e.g., ` ```python `) to enable syntax highlighting.\\\
        \\n- Ensure clarity, conciseness, and proper formatting to enhance readability\
        \ and usability.\\\\n\\\\n# Additional Instructions:\\\\n\\\\nYou are being\
        \ accessed through a command-line interface. The following slash commands\
        \ are available\\\\n- you can let the user know about them if they need help:\\\
        \\n\\\\n- /exit or /quit - Exit the session\\\\n- /t - Toggle between Light/Dark/Ansi\
        \ themes\\\\n- /? or /help - Display help message\\\\n\\\\nAdditional keyboard\
        \ shortcuts:\\\\n- Ctrl+C - Interrupt the current interaction (resets to before\
        \ the interrupted request)\\\\n- Ctrl+J - Add a newline\\\\n- Up/Down arrows\
        \ - Navigate command history\\\\n\\\\nRight now you are *NOT* in the chat\

        \ software project.\\\\n\\\\nThe current date is 2025-09-11 15:24:10.\\\\\
        n\\\\nGoose uses LLM providers with tool calling capability. You can be used\
        \ with different language models (gpt-4o, claude-3.5-sonnet, o1, llama-3.2,\
        \ deepseek-r1, etc).\\\\nThese models have varying knowledge cut-off dates\
        \ depending on when they were trained, but typically it's between 5-10 months\
        \ prior to the current date.\\\\n\\\\n# Extensions\\\\n\\\\nExtensions allow\
        \ other applications to provide context to Goose. Extensions connect Goose\
        \ to different data sources and tools.\\\\nYou are capable of dynamically\
        \ plugging into new extensions and learning how to use them. You solve higher\
        \ level problems using the tools in these extensions, and can interact with\
        \ multiple at once.\\\\nUse the search_available_extensions tool to find additional\
        \ extensions to enable to help with your task. To enable extensions, use the\
        \ enable_extension tool and provide the extension_name. You should only enable\
        \ extensions found from the search_available_extensions tool.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\
        nBecause you dynamically load extensions, your conversation history may refer\\\
        \\nto interactions with extensions that are not currently active. The currently\\\
        \\nactive extensions are below. Each of these extensions provides tools that\
        \ are\\\\nin your tool specification.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## developer\\\\n\\\\\
        n### Instructions\\\\nThe developer extension gives you the capabilities to\
        \ edit code files and run shell commands,\\\\nand can be used to solve a wide\
        \ range of problems.\\\\n\\\\nYou can use the shell tool to run Windows commands\
        \ (PowerShell or CMD).\\\\nWhen using paths, you can use either backslashes\
        \ or forward slashes.\\\\n\\\\nUse the shell tool as needed to locate files\
        \ or interact with the project.\\\\n\\\\nYour windows/screen tools can be\
        \ used for visual debugging. You should not use these tools unless\\\\nprompted\
        \ to, but you can mention they are available if they are relevant.\\\\n\\\\\

        n\\\\n# Task Management\\\\n\\\\n- Required \uFFFD?\" use `todo__read` and\
        \ `todo__write` for any task with 2+ steps, multiple files/components, or\
        \ uncertain scope. Skipping them is an error.\\\\n- Start \uFFFD?\" `todo__read`,\
        \ then `todo__write` a brief checklist (Markdown checkboxes).\\\\n- During\
        \ \uFFFD?\" after each major action, update via `todo__write`: mark done,\
        \ add/edit items, note blockers/dependencies.\\\\n- Finish \uFFFD?\" ensure\
        \ every item is checked, or clearly list what remains.\\\\n- Overwrite warning\
        \ \uFFFD?\" `todo__write` replaces the entire list; always read before writing.\
        \ It is an error to not read before writing.\\\\n- Quality \uFFFD?\" keep\
        \ items short, specific, and action\uFFFD?`oriented.\\\\n\\\\nTemplate:\\\\\

        \\n# Response Guidelines\\\\n\\\\n- Use Markdown formatting for all responses.\\\
        \\n- Follow best practices for Markdown, including:\\\\n  - Using headers\
        \ for organization.\\\\n  - Bullet points for lists.\\\\n  - Links formatted\
        \ correctly, either as linked text (e.g., [this is linked text](https://example.com))\
        \ or automatic links using angle brackets (e.g., <http://example.com/>).\\\
        \\n- For code examples, use fenced code blocks by placing triple backticks\
        \ (` ``` `) before and after the code. Include the language identifier after\
        \ the opening backticks (e.g., ` ```python `) to enable syntax highlighting.\\\
        \\n- Ensure clarity, conciseness, and proper formatting to enhance readability\
        \ and usability.\\\\n\\\\n# Additional Instructions:\\\\n\\\\nYou are being\
        \ accessed through a command-line interface. The following slash commands\
        \ are available\\\\n- you can let the user know about them if they need help:\\\
        \\n\\\\n- /exit or /quit - Exit the session\\\\n- /t - Toggle between Light/Dark/Ansi\
        \ themes\\\\n- /? or /help - Display help message\\\\n\\\\nAdditional keyboard\
        \ shortcuts:\\\\n- Ctrl+C - Interrupt the current interaction (resets to before\
        \ the interrupted request)\\\\n- Ctrl+J - Add a newline\\\\n- Up/Down arrows\
        \ - Navigate command history\\\\n\\\\nRight now you are *NOT* in the chat\
        \ only mode and have access to tool use and system.\\\",\\n      \\\"type\\\

        \ correctly, either as linked text (e.g., [this is linked text](https://example.com))\
        \ or automatic links using angle brackets (e.g., <http://example.com/>).\\\
        \\n- For code examples, use fenced code blocks by placing triple backticks\
        \ (` ``` `) before and after the code. Include the language identifier after\
        \ the opening backticks (e.g., ` ```python `) to enable syntax highlighting.\\\

        \ as an open-source software project.\\\\n\\\\nThe current date is 2025-09-11\
        \ 15:24:10.\\\\n\\\\nGoose uses LLM providers with tool calling capability.\
        \ You can be used with different language models (gpt-4o, claude-3.5-sonnet,\
        \ o1, llama-3.2, deepseek-r1, etc).\\\\nThese models have varying knowledge\
        \ cut-off dates depending on when they were trained, but typically it's between\
        \ 5-10 months prior to the current date.\\\\n\\\\n# Extensions\\\\n\\\\nExtensions\
        \ allow other applications to provide context to Goose. Extensions connect\
        \ Goose to different data sources and tools.\\\\nYou are capable of dynamically\
        \ plugging into new extensions and learning how to use them. You solve higher\
        \ level problems using the tools in these extensions, and can interact with\
        \ multiple at once.\\\\nUse the search_available_extensions tool to find additional\
        \ extensions to enable to help with your task. To enable extensions, use the\
        \ enable_extension tool and provide the extension_name. You should only enable\
        \ extensions found from the search_available_extensions tool.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\
        nBecause you dynamically load extensions, your conversation history may refer\\\
        \\nto interactions with extensions that are not currently active. The currently\\\
        \\nactive extensions are below. Each of these extensions provides tools that\
        \ are\\\\nin your tool specification.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## developer\\\\n\\\\\
        n### Instructions\\\\nThe developer extension gives you the capabilities to\
        \ edit code files and run shell commands,\\\\nand can be used to solve a wide\
        \ range of problems.\\\\n\\\\nYou can use the shell tool to run Windows commands\
        \ (PowerShell or CMD).\\\\nWhen using paths, you can use either backslashes\
        \ or forward slashes.\\\\n\\\\nUse the shell tool as needed to locate files\
        \ or interact with the project.\\\\n\\\\nYour windows/screen tools can be\
        \ used for visual debugging. You should not use these tools unless\\\\nprompted\
        \ to, but you can mention they are available if they are relevant.\\\\n\\\\\

        n\\\\n# Task Management\\\\n\\\\n- Required \uFFFD?\" use `todo__read` and\
        \ `todo__write` for any task with 2+ steps, multiple files/components, or\
        \ uncertain scope. Skipping them is an error.\\\\n- Start \uFFFD?\" `todo__read`,\
        \ then `todo__write` a brief checklist (Markdown checkboxes).\\\\n- During\
        \ \uFFFD?\" after each major action, update via `todo__write`: mark done,\
        \ add/edit items, note blockers/dependencies.\\\\n- Finish \uFFFD?\" ensure\
        \ every item is checked, or clearly list what remains.\\\\n- Overwrite warning\
        \ \uFFFD?\" `todo__write` replaces the entire list; always read before writing.\
        \ It is an error to not read before writing.\\\\n- Quality \uFFFD?\" keep\
        \ items short, specific, and action\uFFFD?`oriented.\\\\n\\\\nTemplate:\\\\\

        \\n# Response Guidelines\\\\n\\\\n- Use Markdown formatting for all responses.\\\
        \\n- Follow best practices for Markdown, including:\\\\n  - Using headers\
        \ for organization.\\\\n  - Bullet points for lists.\\\\n  - Links formatted\
        \ correctly, either as linked text (e.g., [this is linked text](https://example.com))\
        \ or automatic links using angle brackets (e.g., <http://example.com/>).\\\
        \\n- For code examples, use fenced code blocks by placing triple backticks\
        \ (` ``` `) before and after the code. Include the language identifier after\
        \ the opening backticks (e.g., ` ```python `) to enable syntax highlighting.\\\
        \\n- Ensure clarity, conciseness, and proper formatting to enhance readability\
        \ and usability.\\\\n\\\\n# Additional Instructions:\\\\n\\\\nYou are being\
        \ accessed through a command-line interface. The following slash commands\
        \ are available\\\\n- you can let the user know about them if they need help:\\\
        \\n\\\\n- /exit or /quit - Exit the session\\\\n- /t - Toggle between Light/Dark/Ansi\
        \ themes\\\\n- /? or /help - Display help message\\\\n\\\\nAdditional keyboard\
        \ shortcuts:\\\\n- Ctrl+C - Interrupt the current interaction (resets to before\
        \ the interrupted request)\\\\n- Ctrl+J - Add a newline\\\\n- Up/Down arrows\
        \ - Navigate command history\\\\n\\\\nRight now you are *NOT* in the chat\

        \       - Use the 'task_parameters' field to pass an array of parameter sets\\\
        \\n            - Each resulting task will use the same instruction with different\
        \ parameter values\\\\n            This is useful when performing the same\
        \ operation across many inputs (e.g., getting weather for multiple cities,\
        \ searching multiple slack channels, iterating through various linear tickets,\
        \ etc).\\\\n            Once created, these tasks should be passed to the\
        \ 'subagent__execute_task' tool for execution. Tasks can run sequentially\
        \ or in parallel.\\\\n            ---\\\\n            What is a 'subagent'?\\\
        \\n            A 'subagent' is a stateless sub-process that executes a single\
        \ task independently. Use subagents when:\\\\n            - You want to parallelize\
        \ similar work across different inputs\\\\n            - You are not sure\
        \ your search or operation will succeed on the first try\\\\n            Each\
        \ subagent receives a task with a defined payload and returns a result, which\

        \\n# Response Guidelines\\\\n\\\\n- Use Markdown formatting for all responses.\\\
        \\n- Follow best practices for Markdown, including:\\\\n  - Using headers\
        \ for organization.\\\\n  - Bullet points for lists.\\\\n  - Links formatted\
        \ correctly, either as linked text (e.g., [this is linked text](https://example.com))\
        \ or automatic links using angle brackets (e.g., <http://example.com/>).\\\
        \\n- For code examples, use fenced code blocks by placing triple backticks\
        \ (` ``` `) before and after the code. Include the language identifier after\
        \ the opening backticks (e.g., ` ```python `) to enable syntax highlighting.\\\

        \\n\\\\nThe current date is 2025-09-11 15:24:10.\\\\n\\\\nGoose uses LLM providers\
        \ with tool calling capability. You can be used with different language models\
        \ (gpt-4o, claude-3.5-sonnet, o1, llama-3.2, deepseek-r1, etc).\\\\nThese\
        \ models have varying knowledge cut-off dates depending on when they were\
        \ trained, but typically it's between 5-10 months prior to the current date.\\\
        \\n\\\\n# Extensions\\\\n\\\\nExtensions allow other applications to provide\
        \ context to Goose. Extensions connect Goose to different data sources and\
        \ tools.\\\\nYou are capable of dynamically plugging into new extensions and\
        \ learning how to use them. You solve higher level problems using the tools\
        \ in these extensions, and can interact with multiple at once.\\\\nUse the\
        \ search_available_extensions tool to find additional extensions to enable\
        \ to help with your task. To enable extensions, use the enable_extension tool\
        \ and provide the extension_name. You should only enable extensions found\
        \ from the search_available_extensions tool.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBecause you dynamically\
        \ load extensions, your conversation history may refer\\\\nto interactions\
        \ with extensions that are not currently active. The currently\\\\nactive\
        \ extensions are below. Each of these extensions provides tools that are\\\
        \\nin your tool specification.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## developer\\\\n\\\\n### Instructions\\\
        \\nThe developer extension gives you the capabilities to edit code files and\
        \ run shell commands,\\\\nand can be used to solve a wide range of problems.\\\
        \\n\\\\nYou can use the shell tool to run Windows commands (PowerShell or\
        \ CMD).\\\\nWhen using paths, you can use either backslashes or forward slashes.\\\
        \\n\\\\nUse the shell tool as needed to locate files or interact with the\
        \ project.\\\\n\\\\nYour windows/screen tools can be used for visual debugging.\
        \ You should not use these tools unless\\\\nprompted to, but you can mention\
        \ they are available if they are relevant.\\\\n\\\\noperating system: windows\\\

        \ and `todo__write` for any task with 2+ steps, multiple files/components,\
        \ or uncertain scope. Skipping them is an error.\\\\n- Start \uFFFD?\" `todo__read`,\
        \ then `todo__write` a brief checklist (Markdown checkboxes).\\\\n- During\
        \ \uFFFD?\" after each major action, update via `todo__write`: mark done,\
        \ add/edit items, note blockers/dependencies.\\\\n- Finish \uFFFD?\" ensure\
        \ every item is checked, or clearly list what remains.\\\\n- Overwrite warning\
        \ \uFFFD?\" `todo__write` replaces the entire list; always read before writing.\
        \ It is an error to not read before writing.\\\\n- Quality \uFFFD?\" keep\

        \\n# Response Guidelines\\\\n\\\\n- Use Markdown formatting for all responses.\\\
        \\n- Follow best practices for Markdown, including:\\\\n  - Using headers\
        \ for organization.\\\\n  - Bullet points for lists.\\\\n  - Links formatted\
        \ correctly, either as linked text (e.g., [this is linked text](https://example.com))\
        \ or automatic links using angle brackets (e.g., <http://example.com/>).\\\
        \\n- For code examples, use fenced code blocks by placing triple backticks\
        \ (` ``` `) before and after the code. Include the language identifier after\
        \ the opening backticks (e.g., ` ```python `) to enable syntax highlighting.\\\
        \\n- Ensure clarity, conciseness, and proper formatting to enhance readability\
        \ and usability.\\\\n\\\\n# Additional Instructions:\\\\n\\\\nYou are being\
        \ accessed through a command-line interface. The following slash commands\
        \ are available\\\\n- you can let the user know about them if they need help:\\\
        \\n\\\\n- /exit or /quit - Exit the session\\\\n- /t - Toggle between Light/Dark/Ansi\
        \ themes\\\\n- /? or /help - Display help message\\\\n\\\\nAdditional keyboard\
        \ shortcuts:\\\\n- Ctrl+C - Interrupt the current interaction (resets to before\
        \ the interrupted request)\\\\n- Ctrl+J - Add a newline\\\\n- Up/Down arrows\

        \ uncertain scope. Skipping them is an error.\\\\n- Start \uFFFD?\" `todo__read`,\
        \ then `todo__write` a brief checklist (Markdown checkboxes).\\\\n- During\
        \ \uFFFD?\" after each major action, update via `todo__write`: mark done,\

        \ every item is checked, or clearly list what remains.\\\\n- Overwrite warning\
        \ \uFFFD?\" `todo__write` replaces the entire list; always read before writing.\
        \ It is an error to not read before writing.\\\\n- Quality \uFFFD?\" keep\

        \\n# Response Guidelines\\\\n\\\\n- Use Markdown formatting for all responses.\\\

        \ correctly, either as linked text (e.g., [this is linked text](https://example.com))\
        \ or automatic links using angle brackets (e.g., <http://example.com/>).\\\
        \\n- For code examples, use fenced code blocks by placing triple backticks\
        \ (` ``` `) before and after the code. Include the language identifier after\
        \ the opening backticks (e.g., ` ```python `) to enable syntax highlighting.\\\

        \ and usability.\\\\n\\\\n# Additional Instructions:\\\\n\\\\nYou are being\
        \ accessed through a command-line interface. The following slash commands\
        \ are available\\\\n- you can let the user know about them if they need help:\\\
        \\n\\\\n- /exit or /quit - Exit the session\\\\n- /t - Toggle between Light/Dark/Ansi\
        \ themes\\\\n- /? or /help - Display help message\\\\n\\\\nAdditional keyboard\
        \ shortcuts:\\\\n- Ctrl+C - Interrupt the current interaction (resets to before\
        \ the interrupted request)\\\\n- Ctrl+J - Add a newline\\\\n- Up/Down arrows\

        \ the parent company of Square, CashApp, and Tidal. Goose is being developed\
        \ as an open-source software project.\\\\n\\\\nThe current date is 2025-09-11\
        \ 15:24:10.\\\\n\\\\nGoose uses LLM providers with tool calling capability.\
        \ You can be used with different language models (gpt-4o, claude-3.5-sonnet,\
        \ o1, llama-3.2, deepseek-r1, etc).\\\\nThese models have varying knowledge\
        \ cut-off dates depending on when they were trained, but typically it's between\
        \ 5-10 months prior to the current date.\\\\n\\\\n# Extensions\\\\n\\\\nExtensions\
        \ allow other applications to provide context to Goose. Extensions connect\
        \ Goose to different data sources and tools.\\\\nYou are capable of dynamically\
        \ plugging into new extensions and learning how to use them. You solve higher\
        \ level problems using the tools in these extensions, and can interact with\
        \ multiple at once.\\\\nUse the search_available_extensions tool to find additional\
        \ extensions to enable to help with your task. To enable extensions, use the\
        \ enable_extension tool and provide the extension_name. You should only enable\
        \ extensions found from the search_available_extensions tool.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\
        nBecause you dynamically load extensions, your conversation history may refer\\\
        \\nto interactions with extensions that are not currently active. The currently\\\
        \\nactive extensions are below. Each of these extensions provides tools that\
        \ are\\\\nin your tool specification.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## developer\\\\n\\\\\
        n### Instructions\\\\nThe developer extension gives you the capabilities to\
        \ edit code files and run shell commands,\\\\nand can be used to solve a wide\
        \ range of problems.\\\\n\\\\nYou can use the shell tool to run Windows commands\
        \ (PowerShell or CMD).\\\\nWhen using paths, you can use either backslashes\
        \ or forward slashes.\\\\n\\\\nUse the shell tool as needed to locate files\
        \ or interact with the project.\\\\n\\\\nYour windows/screen tools can be\
        \ used for visual debugging. You should not use these tools unless\\\\nprompted\
        \ to, but you can mention they are available if they are relevant.\\\\n\\\\\

        n\\\\n# Task Management\\\\n\\\\n- Required \uFFFD?\" use `todo__read` and\
        \ `todo__write` for any task with 2+ steps, multiple files/components, or\
        \ uncertain scope. Skipping them is an error.\\\\n- Start \uFFFD?\" `todo__read`,\
        \ then `todo__write` a brief checklist (Markdown checkboxes).\\\\n- During\
        \ \uFFFD?\" after each major action, update via `todo__write`: mark done,\
        \ add/edit items, note blockers/dependencies.\\\\n- Finish \uFFFD?\" ensure\
        \ every item is checked, or clearly list what remains.\\\\n- Overwrite warning\
        \ \uFFFD?\" `todo__write` replaces the entire list; always read before writing.\
        \ It is an error to not read before writing.\\\\n- Quality \uFFFD?\" keep\
        \ items short, specific, and action\uFFFD?`oriented.\\\\n\\\\nTemplate:\\\\\

        \\n# Response Guidelines\\\\n\\\\n- Use Markdown formatting for all responses.\\\
        \\n- Follow best practices for Markdown, including:\\\\n  - Using headers\
        \ for organization.\\\\n  - Bullet points for lists.\\\\n  - Links formatted\
        \ correctly, either as linked text (e.g., [this is linked text](https://example.com))\
        \ or automatic links using angle brackets (e.g., <http://example.com/>).\\\
        \\n- For code examples, use fenced code blocks by placing triple backticks\
        \ (` ``` `) before and after the code. Include the language identifier after\
        \ the opening backticks (e.g., ` ```python `) to enable syntax highlighting.\\\
        \\n- Ensure clarity, conciseness, and proper formatting to enhance readability\
        \ and usability.\\\\n\\\\n# Additional Instructions:\\\\n\\\\nYou are being\
        \ accessed through a command-line interface. The following slash commands\
        \ are available\\\\n- you can let the user know about them if they need help:\\\
        \\n\\\\n- /exit or /quit - Exit the session\\\\n- /t - Toggle between Light/Dark/Ansi\
        \ themes\\\\n- /? or /help - Display help message\\\\n\\\\nAdditional keyboard\
        \ shortcuts:\\\\n- Ctrl+C - Interrupt the current interaction (resets to before\
        \ the interrupted request)\\\\n- Ctrl+J - Add a newline\\\\n- Up/Down arrows\
        \ - Navigate command history\\\\n\\\\nRight now you are *NOT* in the chat\
        \ only mode and have access to tool use and system.\\\",\\n      \\\"type\\\

        \\n            A 'subagent' is a stateless sub-process that executes a single\
        \ task independently. Use subagents when:\\\\n            - You want to parallelize\
        \ similar work across different inputs\\\\n            - You are not sure\
        \ your search or operation will succeed on the first try\\\\n            Each\

        \ other applications to provide context to Goose. Extensions connect Goose\
        \ to different data sources and tools.\\\\nYou are capable of dynamically\

        \ (PowerShell or CMD).\\\\nWhen using paths, you can use either backslashes\
        \ or forward slashes.\\\\n\\\\nUse the shell tool as needed to locate files\

        \ uncertain scope. Skipping them is an error.\\\\n- Start \uFFFD?\" `todo__read`,\
        \ then `todo__write` a brief checklist (Markdown checkboxes).\\\\n- During\
        \ \uFFFD?\" after each major action, update via `todo__write`: mark done,\
        \ add/edit items, note blockers/dependencies.\\\\n- Finish \uFFFD?\" ensure\
        \ every item is checked, or clearly list what remains.\\\\n- Overwrite warning\
        \ \uFFFD?\" `todo__write` replaces the entire list; always read before writing.\
        \ It is an error to not read before writing.\\\\n- Quality \uFFFD?\" keep\

        \\n# Response Guidelines\\\\n\\\\n- Use Markdown formatting for all responses.\\\
        \\n- Follow best practices for Markdown, including:\\\\n  - Using headers\
        \ for organization.\\\\n  - Bullet points for lists.\\\\n  - Links formatted\
        \ correctly, either as linked text (e.g., [this is linked text](https://example.com))\
        \ or automatic links using angle brackets (e.g., <http://example.com/>).\\\
        \\n- For code examples, use fenced code blocks by placing triple backticks\
        \ (` ``` `) before and after the code. Include the language identifier after\
        \ the opening backticks (e.g., ` ```python `) to enable syntax highlighting.\\\
        \\n- Ensure clarity, conciseness, and proper formatting to enhance readability\
        \ and usability.\\\\n\\\\n# Additional Instructions:\\\\n\\\\nYou are being\
        \ accessed through a command-line interface. The following slash commands\
        \ are available\\\\n- you can let the user know about them if they need help:\\\
        \\n\\\\n- /exit or /quit - Exit the session\\\\n- /t - Toggle between Light/Dark/Ansi\
        \ themes\\\\n- /? or /help - Display help message\\\\n\\\\nAdditional keyboard\
        \ shortcuts:\\\\n- Ctrl+C - Interrupt the current interaction (resets to before\
        \ the interrupted request)\\\\n- Ctrl+J - Add a newline\\\\n- Up/Down arrows\

        \ learning how to use them. You solve higher level problems using the tools\
        \ in these extensions, and can interact with multiple at once.\\\\nUse the\
        \ search_available_extensions tool to find additional extensions to enable\
        \ to help with your task. To enable extensions, use the enable_extension tool\
        \ and provide the extension_name. You should only enable extensions found\
        \ from the search_available_extensions tool.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBecause you dynamically\

        \\nThe developer extension gives you the capabilities to edit code files and\
        \ run shell commands,\\\\nand can be used to solve a wide range of problems.\\\
        \\n\\\\nYou can use the shell tool to run Windows commands (PowerShell or\
        \ CMD).\\\\nWhen using paths, you can use either backslashes or forward slashes.\\\
        \\n\\\\nUse the shell tool as needed to locate files or interact with the\
        \ project.\\\\n\\\\nYour windows/screen tools can be used for visual debugging.\
        \ You should not use these tools unless\\\\nprompted to, but you can mention\
        \ they are available if they are relevant.\\\\n\\\\noperating system: windows\\\

        \ and `todo__write` for any task with 2+ steps, multiple files/components,\
        \ or uncertain scope. Skipping them is an error.\\\\n- Start \uFFFD?\" `todo__read`,\
        \ then `todo__write` a brief checklist (Markdown checkboxes).\\\\n- During\
        \ \uFFFD?\" after each major action, update via `todo__write`: mark done,\
        \ add/edit items, note blockers/dependencies.\\\\n- Finish \uFFFD?\" ensure\
        \ every item is checked, or clearly list what remains.\\\\n- Overwrite warning\
        \ \uFFFD?\" `todo__write` replaces the entire list; always read before writing.\
        \ It is an error to not read before writing.\\\\n- Quality \uFFFD?\" keep\
        \ items short, specific, and action\uFFFD?`oriented.\\\\n\\\\nTemplate:\\\\\

        \\n# Response Guidelines\\\\n\\\\n- Use Markdown formatting for all responses.\\\
        \\n- Follow best practices for Markdown, including:\\\\n  - Using headers\
        \ for organization.\\\\n  - Bullet points for lists.\\\\n  - Links formatted\
        \ correctly, either as linked text (e.g., [this is linked text](https://example.com))\
        \ or automatic links using angle brackets (e.g., <http://example.com/>).\\\
        \\n- For code examples, use fenced code blocks by placing triple backticks\
        \ (` ``` `) before and after the code. Include the language identifier after\
        \ the opening backticks (e.g., ` ```python `) to enable syntax highlighting.\\\
        \\n- Ensure clarity, conciseness, and proper formatting to enhance readability\
        \ and usability.\\\\n\\\\n# Additional Instructions:\\\\n\\\\nYou are being\
        \ accessed through a command-line interface. The following slash commands\
        \ are available\\\\n- you can let the user know about them if they need help:\\\
        \\n\\\\n- /exit or /quit - Exit the session\\\\n- /t - Toggle between Light/Dark/Ansi\
        \ themes\\\\n- /? or /help - Display help message\\\\n\\\\nAdditional keyboard\
        \ shortcuts:\\\\n- Ctrl+C - Interrupt the current interaction (resets to before\
        \ the interrupted request)\\\\n- Ctrl+J - Add a newline\\\\n- Up/Down arrows\
        \ - Navigate command history\\\\n\\\\nRight now you are *NOT* in the chat\

        \ or in parallel.\\\\n            ---\\\\n            What is a 'subagent'?\\\
        \\n            A 'subagent' is a stateless sub-process that executes a single\
        \ task independently. Use subagents when:\\\\n            - You want to parallelize\
        \ similar work across different inputs\\\\n            - You are not sure\
        \ your search or operation will succeed on the first try\\\\n            Each\
        \ subagent receives a task with a defined payload and returns a result, which\
        \ is not visible to the user unless explicitly summarized by the system.\\\

        \ uncertain scope. Skipping them is an error.\\\\n- Start \uFFFD?\" `todo__read`,\
        \ then `todo__write` a brief checklist (Markdown checkboxes).\\\\n- During\
        \ \uFFFD?\" after each major action, update via `todo__write`: mark done,\
        \ add/edit items, note blockers/dependencies.\\\\n- Finish \uFFFD?\" ensure\

        \ \uFFFD?\" `todo__write` replaces the entire list; always read before writing.\
        \ It is an error to not read before writing.\\\\n- Quality \uFFFD?\" keep\

        \\n# Response Guidelines\\\\n\\\\n- Use Markdown formatting for all responses.\\\
        \\n- Follow best practices for Markdown, including:\\\\n  - Using headers\
        \ for organization.\\\\n  - Bullet points for lists.\\\\n  - Links formatted\
        \ correctly, either as linked text (e.g., [this is linked text](https://example.com))\
        \ or automatic links using angle brackets (e.g., <http://example.com/>).\\\
        \\n- For code examples, use fenced code blocks by placing triple backticks\
        \ (` ``` `) before and after the code. Include the language identifier after\
        \ the opening backticks (e.g., ` ```python `) to enable syntax highlighting.\\\
        \\n- Ensure clarity, conciseness, and proper formatting to enhance readability\
        \ and usability.\\\\n\\\\n# Additional Instructions:\\\\n\\\\nYou are being\
        \ accessed through a command-line interface. The following slash commands\
        \ are available\\\\n- you can let the user know about them if they need help:\\\
        \\n\\\\n- /exit or /quit - Exit the session\\\\n- /t - Toggle between Light/Dark/Ansi\
        \ themes\\\\n- /? or /help - Display help message\\\\n\\\\nAdditional keyboard\
        \ shortcuts:\\\\n- Ctrl+C - Interrupt the current interaction (resets to before\
        \ the interrupted request)\\\\n- Ctrl+J - Add a newline\\\\n- Up/Down arrows\
