              \ is a focal epilepsy with seizures arising mainly during sleep and\
              \ characterized by complex, often bizarre, motor behavior or sustained\
              \ dystonic posturing. First described in 1981, it was initially considered\
              \ a motor disorder of sleep and was named nocturnal paroxysmal dystonia\
              \ (NPD). The unusual seizure semiology, onset during sleep, and often\
              \ uninformative scalp EEG and brain MRI make it difficult to distinguish\
              \ NPD attacks from other non-epileptic nocturnal paroxysmal events,\
              \ namely parasomnias. The long-debated epileptic origin of the condition\
              \ was finally demonstrated in 1990 and the term NFLE introduced. Even\
              \ though many aspects of parasomnias and NFLE have been clarified in\
              \ the last two decades, the differential diagnosis remains a challenge\
              \ for clinicians. To address controversial issues and define the diagnostic\
              \ criteria for NFLE, a Consensus Conference was held in Bologna, Italy\
              \ in 2014. Major points of agreement emerged on: (i) the relationship\
              \ of the seizures with sleep and not with the circadian pattern of seizure\
              \ occurrence; (ii) the possible extrafrontal origin of hypermotor seizures,\
              \ without substantial differences in seizure semiology. In the wake\
              \ of the Consensus, the syndrome was renamed Sleep-Related Hypermotor\
              \ Epilepsy (SHE).\",\n  \"affiliation\": \"IRCCS Institute of Neurological\

        : \"Nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (NFLE) is a focal epilepsy with seizures\
        \ arising mainly during sleep and characterized by complex, often bizarre,\
        \ motor behavior or sustained dystonic posturing. First described in 1981,\
        \ it was initially considered a motor disorder of sleep and was named nocturnal\
        \ paroxysmal dystonia (NPD). The unusual seizure semiology, onset during sleep,\
        \ and often uninformative scalp EEG and brain MRI make it difficult to distinguish\
        \ NPD attacks from other non-epileptic nocturnal paroxysmal events, namely\
        \ parasomnias. The long-debated epileptic origin of the condition was finally\
        \ demonstrated in 1990 and the term NFLE introduced. Even though many aspects\
        \ of parasomnias and NFLE have been clarified in the last two decades, the\
        \ differential diagnosis remains a challenge for clinicians. To address controversial\
        \ issues and define the diagnostic criteria for NFLE, a Consensus Conference\
        \ was held in Bologna, Italy in 2014. Major points of agreement emerged on:\
        \ (i) the relationship of the seizures with sleep and not with the circadian\
        \ pattern of seizure occurrence; (ii) the possible extrafrontal origin of\
        \ hypermotor seizures, without substantial differences in seizure semiology.\
        \ In the wake of the Consensus, the syndrome was renamed Sleep-Related Hypermotor\
        \ Epilepsy (SHE).\",\n  \"affiliation\": \"IRCCS Institute of Neurological\

              \ epilepsy with seizures arising mainly during sleep and characterized\
              \ by complex, often bizarre, motor behavior or sustained dystonic posturing.\
              \ First described in 1981, it was initially considered a motor disorder\
              \ of sleep and was named nocturnal paroxysmal dystonia (NPD). The unusual\
              \ seizure semiology, onset during sleep, and often uninformative scalp\
              \ EEG and brain MRI make it difficult to distinguish NPD attacks from\
              \ other non-epileptic nocturnal paroxysmal events, namely parasomnias.\
              \ The long-debated epileptic origin of the condition was finally demonstrated\
              \ in 1990 and the term NFLE introduced. Even though many aspects of\
              \ parasomnias and NFLE have been clarified in the last two decades,\
              \ the differential diagnosis remains a challenge for clinicians. To\
              \ address controversial issues and define the diagnostic criteria for\
              \ NFLE, a Consensus Conference was held in Bologna, Italy in 2014. Major\
              \ points of agreement emerged on: (i) the relationship of the seizures\
              \ with sleep and not with the circadian pattern of seizure occurrence;\
              \ (ii) the possible extrafrontal origin of hypermotor seizures, without\
              \ substantial differences in seizure semiology. In the wake of the Consensus,\
              \ the syndrome was renamed Sleep-Related Hypermotor Epilepsy (SHE).\"\

        : \"Nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (NFLE) is a focal epilepsy with seizures\
        \ arising mainly during sleep and characterized by complex, often bizarre,\
        \ motor behavior or sustained dystonic posturing. First described in 1981,\
        \ it was initially considered a motor disorder of sleep and was named nocturnal\
        \ paroxysmal dystonia (NPD). The unusual seizure semiology, onset during sleep,\
        \ and often uninformative scalp EEG and brain MRI make it difficult to distinguish\
        \ NPD attacks from other non-epileptic nocturnal paroxysmal events, namely\
        \ parasomnias. The long-debated epileptic origin of the condition was finally\
        \ demonstrated in 1990 and the term NFLE introduced. Even though many aspects\
        \ of parasomnias and NFLE have been clarified in the last two decades, the\
        \ differential diagnosis remains a challenge for clinicians. To address controversial\
        \ issues and define the diagnostic criteria for NFLE, a Consensus Conference\
        \ was held in Bologna, Italy in 2014. Major points of agreement emerged on:\
        \ (i) the relationship of the seizures with sleep and not with the circadian\
        \ pattern of seizure occurrence; (ii) the possible extrafrontal origin of\
        \ hypermotor seizures, without substantial differences in seizure semiology.\
        \ In the wake of the Consensus, the syndrome was renamed Sleep-Related Hypermotor\
        \ Epilepsy (SHE).\",\n  \"affiliation\": \"IRCCS Institute of Neurological\

              \ is a focal epilepsy with seizures arising mainly during sleep and\
              \ characterized by complex, often bizarre, motor behavior or sustained\
              \ dystonic posturing. First described in 1981, it was initially considered\
              \ a motor disorder of sleep and was named nocturnal paroxysmal dystonia\
              \ (NPD). The unusual seizure semiology, onset during sleep, and often\
              \ uninformative scalp EEG and brain MRI make it difficult to distinguish\
              \ NPD attacks from other non-epileptic nocturnal paroxysmal events,\
              \ namely parasomnias. The long-debated epileptic origin of the condition\
              \ was finally demonstrated in 1990 and the term NFLE introduced. Even\
              \ though many aspects of parasomnias and NFLE have been clarified in\
              \ the last two decades, the differential diagnosis remains a challenge\
              \ for clinicians. To address controversial issues and define the diagnostic\
              \ criteria for NFLE, a Consensus Conference was held in Bologna, Italy\
              \ in 2014. Major points of agreement emerged on: (i) the relationship\
              \ of the seizures with sleep and not with the circadian pattern of seizure\
              \ occurrence; (ii) the possible extrafrontal origin of hypermotor seizures,\
              \ without substantial differences in seizure semiology. In the wake\
              \ of the Consensus, the syndrome was renamed Sleep-Related Hypermotor\
              \ Epilepsy (SHE).\",\n  \"affiliation\": \"IRCCS Institute of Neurological\

              \ \"Non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep parasomnias are recurrent abnormal\
              \ behaviors emerging as incomplete arousals out of NREM sleep. Mounting\
              \ evidence on NREM sleep parasomnias calls for an update of clinical\
              \ and therapeutical strategies. In the current review, we summarize\
              \ the state of the art and provide the necessary background to stimulate\
              \ a critical revision of diagnostic criteria of disorders of arousal\
              \ (DoA), the most common NREM sleep parasomnia. In particular, we highlight\
              \ the poor sensitivity of the diagnostic items related to amnesia and\
              \ absence of conscious experiences during DoA episodes, encourage the\
              \ role of video-polysomnography and home-video recordings in the diagnostic\
              \ and treatment work-up, and suggest three levels of diagnostic certainty\
              \ based on clinical and objective findings. Furthermore, we highlight\
              \ current gaps of knowledge that prevent the definition of standard\
              \ guidelines and future research avenues.\",\n      \"affiliation\"\

              \ epilepsy and can be translated to patients as precision diagnoses\
              \ that influence clinical treatment, prognosis, and counseling.<h4>Objective</h4>To\
              \ delineate the genetic landscape of pediatric epilepsy and clinical\
              \ utility of genetic diagnoses for patients with epilepsy.<h4>Design,\
              \ setting, and participants</h4>This cohort study used phenotypic data\
              \ from medical records and treating clinicians at a pediatric hospital\
              \ to identify patients with unexplained pediatric-onset epilepsy. Exome\
              \ sequencing was performed for 522 patients and available biological\
              \ parents, and sequencing data were analyzed for single nucleotide variants\
              \ (SNVs) and copy number variants (CNVs). Variant pathogenicity was\
              \ assessed, patients were provided with their diagnostic results, and\
              \ clinical utility was evaluated. Patients were enrolled from August\
              \ 2018 to October 2021, and data were analyzed through December 2022.<h4>Exposures</h4>Phenotypic\
              \ features associated with diagnostic genetic results.<h4>Main outcomes\
              \ and measures</h4>Main outcomes included diagnostic yield and clinical\
              \ utility. Diagnostic findings included variants curated as pathogenic,\
              \ likely pathogenic (PLP), or diagnostic variants of uncertain significance\
              \ (VUS) with clinical features consistent with the involved gene's associated\
              \ phenotype. The proportion of the cohort with diagnostic findings,\
              \ the genes involved, and their clinical utility, defined as impact\
              \ on clinical treatment, prognosis, or surveillance, are reported.<h4>Results</h4>A\
              \ total of 522 children (269 [51.5%] male; mean [SD] age at seizure\
              \ onset, 1.2 [1.4] years) were enrolled, including 142 children (27%)\
              \ with developmental epileptic encephalopathy and 263 children (50.4%)\
              \ with intellectual disability. Of these, 100 participants (19.2%) had\
              \ identifiable genetic explanations for their seizures: 89 participants\
              \ had SNVs (87 germline, 2 somatic mosaic) involving 69 genes, and 11\
              \ participants had CNVs. The likelihood of identifying a genetic diagnosis\
              \ was highest in patients with intellectual disability (adjusted odds\
              \ ratio [aOR], 2.44; 95% CI, 1.40-4.26), early onset seizures (aOR,\
              \ 0.93; 95% CI, 0.88-0.98), and motor impairment (aOR, 2.19; 95% CI\
              \ 1.34-3.58). Among 43 patients with apparently de novo variants, 2\
              \ were subsequently determined to have asymptomatic parents harboring\
              \ mosaic variants. Of 71 patients who received diagnostic results and\
              \ were followed clinically, 29 (41%) had documented clinical utility\
              \ resulting from their genetic diagnoses.<h4>Conclusions and relevance</h4>These\
              \ findings suggest that pediatric-onset epilepsy is genetically heterogeneous\
              \ and that some patients with previously unexplained pediatric-onset\
              \ epilepsy had genetic diagnoses with direct clinical implications.\"\

              \ characterized by severe sleep-related rigid hypermotor seizures. The\
              \ pathogenic genes of ADSHE include genes encoding subunits of the neuronal\
              \ nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, <i>KCNT1</i>, <i>DEPDC5</i>, <i>NPRL2/3</i>,\
              \ <i>CABP4</i>, and <i>CRH.</i> Individuals with <i>KCNT1</i>-related\
              \ ADSHE are more likely to develop seizures at a younger age, have cognitive\
              \ comorbidity, and display psychiatric and behavioral problems. In this\
              \ study, a 12-year-old Chinese girl was referred for genetic evaluation\
              \ of grand mal seizures. She had paroxysmal convulsions of the limbs\
              \ and loss of consciousness just after falling asleep without obvious\
              \ triggers. A novel heterozygous missense mutation c.2797C > T (p.Arg933Cys)\
              \ in exon 24 of the <i>KCNT1</i> was identified in the proband by whole-exome\
              \ sequencing and Sanger sequencing, and the clinical symptoms were compatible\
              \ with ADSHE. The proband's father has been showing similar symptoms\
              \ for more than 20 years and had the same site mutation. Her mother\
              \ and sister were physically and genetically normal. The study revealed\
              \ a novel variant in the <i>KCNT1</i> and expanded the mutation spectrum\
              \ for this clinical condition. Our results provide further evidence\
              \ supporting a causative role in <i>KCNT1</i> variants in ADSHE.\",\n\

              \ objectives</h4>To identify the most relevant clinical and video-polysomnographic\
              \ characteristics of patients with sleep-related dissociative disorders\
              \ (SRDDs) and to propose a framework for new diagnostic criteria.<h4>Methods</h4>We\
              \ searched potential SRDD cases from the scientific literature and from\
              \ a database of patients referred for clinical and video-polysomnographic\
              \ assessment in a single sleep disorders center for disruptive nocturnal\
              \ behaviors (n = 731). The most relevant clinical and neurophysiological\
              \ characteristics of the cases were extracted and a descriptive analysis\
              \ was performed.<h4>Results</h4>Twenty-six SRDD cases (8 new and 18\
              \ previously published cases) were reviewed. Almost all cases of SRDDs\
              \ occurred in a context of past traumatic events or abuse and were associated\
              \ with at least 1 comorbid psychiatric disorder. We highlighted 4 relevant\
              \ clinical characteristics of SRDD useful for the differential diagnosis\
              \ with parasomnias: episodes of long duration of more than 1 hour (90.9%),\
              \ self-inflicted injuries (83.3%), occurrence while awake close to bedtime\
              \ (35.7%), and the presence of daytime dissociative symptoms (72.7%).\
              \ The video-polysomnography documented typical episodes of SRDD with\
              \ prolonged wakefulness before, during, and after the event in 11/26\
              \ cases. New diagnostic criteria for SRDD were proposed, with 3 levels\
              \ of certainty for the diagnosis based on clinical, video-polysomnographic,\
              \ and homemade video findings.<h4>Conclusions</h4>More than 30 years\
              \ after its formal identification, SRDD is not currently recognized\
              \ as an official diagnostic entity. We better delineate the clinical\
              \ and neurophysiological features of SRDD and propose a framework for\
              \ its reinstatement in the next revisions of the sleep and psychiatric\
              \ disorders classifications.<h4>Citation</h4>Lopez R, Lefevre L, Barateau\

              \ (VPSG) and prolonged video-EEG-monitoring (pVEEG-M) are neurophysiological\
              \ investigation modalities. Depending on indication either is performed,\
              \ but occasionally patients undergo both (during the same or separate\
              \ stays). We sought to assess the reasons and potential benefits of\
              \ dual diagnostic assessments with both modalities.<h4>Methods</h4>A\
              \ retrospective chart-review was performed to identify patients who\
              \ underwent both VPSG and pVEEG-M during the 10 year period between\
              \ 2007 and 2017. One-hundred-nine patients were identified who had undergone\
              \ both studies. Patients were grouped according to indication and outcome.<h4>Results</h4>One-hundred-nine\
              \ patients had both, a VPSG and pVEEG-M, in 62 (56.9%) the studies were\
              \ performed because of separate diagnoses independent from each other.\
              \ In 47 patients (43.1%) investigation with both modalities was needed\
              \ to clarify the suspected diagnosis or to refute differential diagnoses.\
              \ Out of these 47, 11 (10.1% of the whole group) arrived a new final\
              \ diagnosis whereas in 36 (33%) the primary diagnosis was corroborated\
              \ with the second modality.<h4>Conclusions</h4>In the majority of cases\
              \ VPSG plus pVEEG-M were indicated to diagnose or monitor different\
              \ comorbid diseases (e.g. sleep-related breathing disorder and epilepsy).\
              \ In the other cases, performing both modalities was useful to achieve\
              \ a higher diagnostic accuracy or to refute differential diagnoses.<h4>Significance</h4>VPSG\
              \ and pVEEG-M are neurophysiological investigations which complement\
              \ each other, especially in case of two different comorbid diseases\
              \ in a single patient, to rule out differential diagnosis or when a\
              \ higher diagnostic certainty is seeked.\",\n      \"affiliation\":\

              : \"Sleep-related hypermotor epilepsy (SHE), previously called nocturnal\
              \ frontal lobe epilepsy (NFLE), is a focal epilepsy characterized by\
              \ asymmetric tonic/dystonic posturing and/or complex hyperkinetic seizures\
              \ occurring mostly during sleep. SHE fulfills the definition of rare\
              \ disease with an estimated minimum prevalence of 1.8/100,000 individuals,\
              \ and it represents about 10% of drug-resistant surgical cases. Although\
              \ SHE and autosomal-dominant SHE (ADSHE) have been considered benign\
              \ epileptic conditions for a long time, emerging data have shed light\
              \ on the severity of this disorder and some peculiar features can impact\
              \ negatively on the quality of life of SHE patients. In fact, seizure\
              \ frequency can be very high, resulting in nocturnal sleep fragmentation\
              \ with possible diurnal consequences such as excessive sleepiness and\
              \ fatigue. Moreover, recent studies, adopting a systematic neuropsychological\
              \ assessment, have shown deficits in memory, executive functions and\
              \ visuo-spatial abilities in almost half of SHE patients. Intellectual\
              \ disabilities and psychiatric disorders have also been reported in\
              \ some genetic forms. SHE may also exert a negative effect on health-related\
              \ quality of life, especially in domains pertaining to a patient's role\
              \ in the family, social context and patient's illness experience. Despite\
              \ a good response to pharmacological treatment, especially with carbamazepine,\
              \ 30% of SHE patients suffer from drug-resistant seizures. Finally,\
              \ recent studies suggest a poor prognosis in a high percentage of SHE\
              \ patients with a 20.4% cumulative probability of achieving terminal\
              \ remission at 10 years from onset. For selected drug-resistant SHE\
              \ patients, epilepsy surgery is the only treatment offering high probability\
              \ of recovery, both for seizures and for epilepsy-related sleep alterations.\"\

              \ (SHE) (previously frontal lobe epilepsy) is a rare seizure disorder\
              \ commonly misdiagnosed or unrecognized, causing negative patient sequelae.\
              \ While usually reported in familial studies, it is more commonly acquired.\
              \ Diagnosis is a challenge due to its low incidence in comparison with\
              \ the more common sleep disorders or psychogenic etiologies in the differential\
              \ diagnosis. Diagnosis is scaled on degree of certainty based on described\
              \ or clinically documented semiology, with video EEG as a helpful, but\
              \ not necessary, adjunct. Current treatment is similar to other focal\
              \ epilepsies. We studied a 36-year-old active duty male soldier who\
              \ presented with 2 years of predominantly sleep related, abrupt, short,\
              \ and anamnestic hyperkinetic movements with unstructured vocalizations.\
              \ Prior workup included non-contributory video electroencephalograph\
              \ (EEG) and polysomnography as well as normal brain magnetic resonance\
              \ imaging (MRI). Treatments for presumed psychiatric and parasomnia\
              \ disturbances were not effective in establishing diagnosis or relief.\
              \ Evaluation at our tertiary, multidisciplinary care institution recorded\
              \ events consistent with the diagnosis of clinical SHE. He was enrolled\
              \ in an advanced multishell diffusion-weighted imaging MRI research\
              \ study to evaluate white matter tracts, given his history of mild,\
              \ repetitive, non-penetrating traumatic brain injury, not otherwise\
              \ requiring hospitalization. Multishell diffusion MRI tractography found\
              \ changes not previously described in the right frontal lobe white matter\
              \ tracts. These changes were consistent with neurological localization\
              \ and serve as a potential nidus for this patient's seizure disorder.\
              \ Misdiagnosis of SHE can result in detrimental biopsychosocial sequelae\
              \ of untreated epilepsy, unnecessary or harmful intervention, or the\
              \ stigmata of a behavioral disorder. Further investigation into diagnosis\
              \ and etiology of acquired SHE is needed. Assessment for white matter\
              \ abnormalities can potentially provide information into pathogenesis\
              \ of epilepsy disorders.\",\n      \"affiliation\": \"School of Medicine,\

              \ lobe epilepsy is recognized worldwide and has been studied in a wide\
              \ range of clinical and scientific settings (epilepsy, sleep medicine,\
              \ neurosurgery, pediatric neurology, epidemiology, genetics). Though\
              \ uncommon, it is of considerable interest to practicing neurologists\
              \ because of complexity in differential diagnosis from more common,\
              \ benign sleep disorders such as parasomnias, or other disorders like\
              \ psychogenic nonepileptic seizures. Moreover, misdiagnosis can have\
              \ substantial adverse consequences on patients' lives. At present, there\
              \ is no consensus definition of this disorder and disagreement persists\
              \ about its core electroclinical features and the spectrum of etiologies\
              \ involved. To improve the definition of the disorder and establish\
              \ diagnostic criteria with levels of certainty, a consensus conference\
              \ using formal recommended methodology was held in Bologna in September\
              \ 2014. It was recommended that the name be changed to sleep-related\
              \ hypermotor epilepsy (SHE), reflecting evidence that the attacks are\
              \ associated with sleep rather than time of day, the seizures may arise\
              \ from extrafrontal sites, and the motor aspects of the seizures are\
              \ characteristic. The etiology may be genetic or due to structural pathology,\
              \ but in most cases remains unknown. Diagnostic criteria were developed\
              \ with 3 levels of certainty: witnessed (possible) SHE, video-documented\
              \ (clinical) SHE, and video-EEG-documented (confirmed) SHE. The main\
              \ research gaps involve epidemiology, pathophysiology, treatment, and\
              \ prognosis.\",\n      \"affiliation\": \"From IRCCS Istituto delle\

              \ known as nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy is recognized worldwide and\
              \ has been studied\\nin a wide range of clinical and scientific settings\
              \ (epilepsy, sleep medicine, neurosurgery, pediatric neu-\\nrology,\
              \ epidemiology, genetics). Though uncommon, it is of considerable interest\
              \ to practicing neurol-\\nogists because of complexity in differential\
              \ diagnosis from more common, benign sleep disorders such\\nas parasomnias,\
              \ or other disorders like psychogenic nonepileptic seizures. Moreover,\
              \ misdiagnosis can\\nhave substantial adverse consequences on patients’\
              \ lives. At present, there is no consensus definition\\nof this disorder\
              \ and disagreement persists about its core electroclinical features\
              \ and the spectrum of\\netiologies involved. To improve the definition\
              \ of the disorder and establish diagnostic criteria with\\nlevels of\
              \ certainty, a consensus conference using formal recommended methodology\
              \ was held in\\nBologna in September 2014. It was recommended that the\
              \ name be changed to sleep-related hyper-\\nmotor epilepsy (SHE), reflecting\
              \ evidence that the attacks are associated with sleep rather than time\
              \ of\\nday, the seizures may arise from extrafrontal sites, and the\
              \ motor aspects of the seizures are char-\\nacteristic. The etiology\
              \ may be genetic or due to structural pathology, but in most cases remains\\\
              nunknown. Diagnostic criteria were developed with 3 levels of certainty:\
              \ witnessed (possible) SHE,\\nvideo-documented (clinical) SHE, and video-EEG-documented\
              \ (confirmed) SHE. The main research gaps\\ninvolve epidemiology, pathophysiology,\
              \ treatment, and prognosis. Neurology® 2016;86:1834–1842\\n\\nGLOSSARY\\\

              \ of\\nthe syndrome (85%). Analytic designs (cohort, case-\\ncontrol)\
              \ were used in only 19% of studies. The topics\\nmost frequently considered\
              \ were clinical semiology\\n(71%), neurophysiology (68%), etiology (64%),\\\
              ntherapy (51%), and genetics (36%). Only 9% of\\nthe studies addressed\
              \ epidemiology, diagnosis, or\\nprognosis.\\n\\nNOMENCLATURE The 2 major\
              \ outcomes of the\\nconsensus conference were the need to change\\nnomenclature\
              \ and the need to recognize the disorder\\nas a distinct epilepsy syndrome.\\\
              n\\nThe new name proposed is sleep-related hypermo-\\ntor epilepsy (SHE).\
              \ Although the name NFLE has\\nhistorical significance, 3 critical\\\
              nissues (discussed\\nand referenced below), justified this change. First,\\\
              n\\nterm nocturnal was\\n\\nthe\\nconsidered misleading\\nbecause it\
              \ implies a chronobiological pattern of sei-\\nthat\\nzure occurrence,\
              \ whereas evidence indicates\\noccurrence in sleep is the most important\
              \ characteris-\\ntic, whether at night or during daytime naps. Second,\\\
              nthe emphasis on localization to the frontal lobe was\\nconsidered misleading\
              \ in view of evidence that the\\ncharacteristic seizures may also arise\
              \ from other cere-\\nbral regions. Third, the original name did not\
              \ specify\\nthe typical clinical semiology involved, which consists\\\
              nprimarily of hypermotor\\nseizures, and may also\\ninclude attacks\
              \ with predominantly tonic or dystonic\\nfeatures. In proposing this\
              \ name, the consensus panel\\nrecognized a logical inconsistency in\
              \ that the term hy-\\npermotor describes a seizure type rather than\
              \ an epi-\\nlepsy type; however, this is also true of several other\\\
              nwidely accepted syndrome names (e.g., progressive\\nmyoclonus epilepsy,\
              \ childhood absence epilepsy).\\nThe consensus was that the simplicity\
              \ and ease of\\nrecall of SHE was more important than this con-\\ncern.\
              \ In addition, although the consensus panel\\nacknowledged that the\
              \ clinical semiology of the\\nsyndrome is not fully captured by “hypermotor,”\\\
              nthey accepted this term because the full syndrome\\ndescription incorporates\
              \ additional details about\\nclinical presentation.\\n\\nAt the present\
              \ state of knowledge, SHE is best re-\\ngarded as a single syndrome;\
              \ neither constellations of\\nclinical features nor presence of comorbidities\
              \ yet jus-\\ntifies the delineation of separate syndromes within\\nSHE.\
              \ Although SHE has diverse etiologies,\\nit is\\ndefined by clinical\
              \ manifestations (hypermotor seiz-\\nures) possibly resulting from shared\
              \ downstream\\nmechanisms occurring during sleep/wake oscilla-\\ntion\
              \ changes, suggesting a unique pathogenic net-\\nwork.10,11,e6 Moreover,\
              \ consideration of SHE as a\\nsingle syndrome is most useful in clinical\
              \ practice,\\nbecause the syndrome requires a distinct diagnostic\\\
              nand therapeutic approach.\\n\\nSo far, only the autosomal dominant\
              \ form of the\\nsyndrome (previously ADNFLE) is included within\\nthe\
              \ guidelines proposed by the International League\\nAgainst Epilepsy\

              \ sleep-related seizures\\nwith various motor manifestations.5,17 Seizure\
              \ onset\\nmay be at any age with a peak during childhood and\\nadolescence.5,17\
              \ Seizure frequency may be very high,\\nwith occurrence either every\

              \ Clustering is\\ncharacteristic but not obligatory for diagnosis. Seizures\\\
              noccur predominantly during sleep (and consequently\\nmost commonly\
              \ during the night), primarily in non-\\nREM (NREM) sleep and rarely\
              \ during REM sleep.\\nSeizures during active wakefulness may also occasion-\\\
              nally occur during the patient’s lifetime. The first occur-\\nrence\
              \ of these seizures may precede, coincide, or follow\\nthe onset of\
              \ sleep-related seizures.17\\n\\nSeizures are abrupt in onset and offset,\
              \ typically\\nbrief (,2 minutes), and have a highly stereotyped\\nmotor\
              \ pattern within individuals.13–15,17 The primary\\nclinical expression\
              \ consists of “hypermotor” events,21\\ncharacterized by vigorous hyperkinetic\
              \ features (com-\\nplex body movements with kicking or cycling of limbs\\\
              nand rocking body movements7), usually with vegeta-\\ntive signs, vocalization,\
              \ and emotional facial expres-\\nsion.7,17 Asymmetric tonic/dystonic\
              \ seizures with or\\nwithout head/eye deviation are also observed.5,17\\\
              n\\nSeizures may be preceded by abrupt arousal or a\\ndistinct aura.5,18\
              \ Awareness of episodes is not uncom-\\nmon.18,22 Typically, patients\
              \ with SHE present a\\nseries of sleep-related motor events becoming\
              \ increas-\\ningly long and complex, even on the same night.\\nClinical\\\
              nfeatures range from brusque stereotyped\\narousals (i.e., paroxysmal\
              \ arousal17 or minor motor\\nevents23), repeated throughout the night\
              \ or arising\\nintermittently, with an almost periodic pattern, to\\\
              ncomplex hypermotor seizures as described above\\nand, more seldom,\
              \ protracted ambulatory behavior\\nknown as epileptic nocturnal wandering.17,22,24,25\\\
              nThese events can last longer than 2 minutes. These\\ndifferent seizure\
              \ manifestations tend to coincide in\\nthe same patient, with the shorter\
              \ events developing\\ninto more prolonged and complex attacks.17,22\
              \ Pa-\\ntients with SHE may complain of unsatisfactory sleep\\nand daytime\
              \ tiredness. However, they do not have\\nsignificantly more daytime\
              \ sleepiness than controls.26\\nDistinction from arousal parasomnias\
              \ usually re-\\nlies on clinical history (frequency, clustering, and\\\
              ntiming with respect to sleep onset of the attacks),16\\neven though\
              \ EEG–polysomnography (PSG) may be\\n\\nrequired in some challenging\
              \ cases. A personal or\\nfamilial history of arousal parasomnias is\
              \ common\\nin patients with SHE, making shared pathophysio-\\nlogic\
              \ pathways plausible in these conditions.27,28\\n\\nThe majority of\
              \ patients have normal intelligence.\\nHowever, intellectual disability\
              \ and behavior disor-\\nders have been reported in SHE,29 especially\
              \ in the\\nfamilial form related to mutations in KCNT1,30 and\\nconsequently\
              \ are not exclusion criteria for SHE.\\n\\nResponse to medication has\
              \ not been systematically\\ninvestigated. Carbamazepine is effective\
              \ at low doses in\\nsome patients with SHE, but this therapy seems to\

              \ SHE is primarily based on clinical\\nhistory. The absence of clear\
              \ interictal and ictal\\nEEG correlates, both during wakefulness and\\\
              nsleep, does not exclude the diagnosis of SHE.13\\n(cid:129) Certainty\
              \ of diagnosis can be categorized into\\n3 levels: witnessed (possible)\
              \ SHE, video-\\ndocumented (clinical) SHE, and video-EEG-\\ndocumented\
              \ (confirmed) SHE.\\n\\nWitnessed (possible) SHE. The main prerequisite\
              \ to\\nsuspect the diagnosis of SHE is the presence of seiz-\\nures\
              \ consisting of obvious and disruptive hypermotor\\nevents, as described\
              \ above. The semiologic aspects of\\nsuch events, as provided by an\
              \ eyewitness, are gener-\\nally concordant with those documented by\
              \ video\\nanalysis.16 Hence, data from a good clinical history\\nare\
              \ sufficient to make the diagnosis of witnessed (pos-\\nsible) SHE.\\\
              n\\nVideo-documented (clinical) SHE. Clinically diagno-\\nsed SHE requires\
              \ audio-video documentation of\\nhypermotor events. In such a video\
              \ recording, at\\nleast 1 event but preferably 2 entire events should\\\
              nbe documented (confirmed to be typical by witness),\\nincluding the\
              \ onset and with clear visualization of\\nthe entire events, showing\
              \ the evolution and offset\\nof the attacks. If the captured episodes\
              \ are minor\\nmotor events or paroxysmal arousals, and if\\nfew\\nepisodes\
              \ are captured, the clinical diagnosis may be\\nunreliable.16,38,39\\\

              nRESEARCH NEEDS The main research gaps in SHE\\nregard epidemiology,\
              \ pathophysiology, prognosis,\\ngenetics, and targeted therapy.\\n\\\
              nPopulation-based studies are needed to estimate\\nthe incidence and\
              \ prevalence of SHE20 and could\\nalso be used to provide critical information\
              \ about\\nprognosis and remission rates, comorbidities, and\\nmortality\
              \ compared to other focal epilepsies. Multi-\\ncenter studies of the\
              \ familial co-occurrence of SHE\\nwith arousal parasomnias are needed\
              \ to elucidate\\npotential shared genetic susceptibility to these 2\\\
              ndisorders.27\\n\\nIn a retrospective cohort of patients with SHE,\\\
              nincidence of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy\\n(SUDEP) was 0.36\
              \ per 1,000 person-years, not higher\\nthan in prevalent epilepsy populations.54\
              \ This paucity\\nof reported SUDEP in SHE is notable, given the daily\\\
              noccurrence of seizures during sleep and the previous\\ndemonstration\
              \ that occurrence of nocturnal seizures is\\na risk factor for SUDEP\
              \ after adjustment for general-\\nized tonic-clonic seizures.55 The\
              \ lower than expected\\nrisk of SUDEP in SHE might reflect a low occurrence\\\
              nof generalized tonic-clonic seizures in SHE.54\\n\\nImproved structured\
              \ instruments for clinical diag-\\nnosis of SHE are needed for epidemiologic\
              \ and\\ngenetic studies. Multicenter studies are needed to elu-\\ncidate\
              \ the SHE spectrum and natural history, ranging\\nfrom clear-cut cases\
              \ to atypical forms overlapping\\nwith parasomnias. Home video recordings\
              \ during\\nsleep may also have utility for improving diagnostic\\naccuracy,\
              \ and additional multicenter\\nstudies are\\nneeded to validate this\
              \ approach. Although a key\\nrole of genetic factors is well-known in\
              \ autosomal\\ndominant SHE, a minority of familial cases and rare\\\
              nsporadic cases have a known genetic cause. Next-\\ngeneration sequencing\
              \ will enable the identification\\nof additional susceptibility genes\
              \ in SHE, and the fre-\\nquency of mutations in specific genes can subse-\\\
              nquently be established through targeted mutation\\ntesting in large\
              \ cohorts. Family studies may also pro-\\nvide insights into genetically\
              \ based phenotypic varia-\\ntion and alternative inheritance patterns\
              \ of SHE such\\nas recessive or polygenic models.\\n\\nThe increasingly\
              \ recognized role of de novo and\\nsomatic mutations in human disease\
              \ is highly relevant\\nto SHE.56 Sporadic cases may have de novo mutations\\\
              nof genes with high penetrance or genes with smaller\\neffects conferring\
              \ risk in polygenic or multifactorial\\nsettings. The identification\
              \ of postzygotic, somatic\\nmutations in brain as causes of malformations\
              \ such\\n\\nas hemimegalencephaly57,58 suggests that other brain\\ndiseases\
              \ may be due to somatic mutations. Such mu-\\ntations may be identifiable\
              \ only in brain tissue from\\npatients undergoing epilepsy surgery,\
              \ or may be pre-\\nsent in other tissues such as blood and saliva due\
              \ to\\nmosaicism.\\n\\nSome individuals in families with DEPDC5 muta-\\\
              ntions have malformations of cortical development, espe-\\ncially focal\
              \ cortical dysplasia.59 Given the role of\\nDEPDC5 as an inhibitor of\
              \ the mTOR pathway, a\\nkey question is whether a second-hit mutation\
              \ is pre-\\nsent in the brain tissue of an individual with a DEPDC5\\\
              nmutation. This can be addressed with whole-exome\\nsequencing of tissue\
              \ removed for refractory epilepsy\\nand may improve understanding of\
              \ the molecular\\npathology of malformations of cortical development.\\\
              n\\nFinally, genetic findings may serve as the basis for\\ndevelopment\
              \ of targeted therapies for SHE. An early\\nexample of the potential\
              \ of this approach is the success-\\nful use of quinidine for treatment\
              \ of a patient with an\\nepileptic encephalopathy caused by a de novo\

        : \"Nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (NFLE) is a focal epilepsy with seizures\
        \ arising mainly during sleep and characterized by complex, often bizarre,\
        \ motor behavior or sustained dystonic posturing. First described in 1981,\
        \ it was initially considered a motor disorder of sleep and was named nocturnal\
        \ paroxysmal dystonia (NPD). The unusual seizure semiology, onset during sleep,\
        \ and often uninformative scalp EEG and brain MRI make it difficult to distinguish\
        \ NPD attacks from other non-epileptic nocturnal paroxysmal events, namely\
        \ parasomnias. The long-debated epileptic origin of the condition was finally\
        \ demonstrated in 1990 and the term NFLE introduced. Even though many aspects\
        \ of parasomnias and NFLE have been clarified in the last two decades, the\
        \ differential diagnosis remains a challenge for clinicians. To address controversial\
        \ issues and define the diagnostic criteria for NFLE, a Consensus Conference\
        \ was held in Bologna, Italy in 2014. Major points of agreement emerged on:\
        \ (i) the relationship of the seizures with sleep and not with the circadian\
        \ pattern of seizure occurrence; (ii) the possible extrafrontal origin of\
        \ hypermotor seizures, without substantial differences in seizure semiology.\
        \ In the wake of the Consensus, the syndrome was renamed Sleep-Related Hypermotor\
        \ Epilepsy (SHE).\",\n  \"affiliation\": \"IRCCS Institute of Neurological\

        \ necessary background to stimulate a critical revision of diagnostic criteria\
        \ of disorders of arousal (DoA), the most common NREM sleep parasomnia. In\

        \ the role of video-polysomnography and home-video recordings in the diagnostic\

        \ advances inform our understanding of epilepsy and can be translated to patients\
        \ as precision diagnoses that influence clinical treatment, prognosis, and\
        \ counseling.<h4>Objective</h4>To delineate the genetic landscape of pediatric\
        \ epilepsy and clinical utility of genetic diagnoses for patients with epilepsy.<h4>Design,\
        \ setting, and participants</h4>This cohort study used phenotypic data from\
        \ medical records and treating clinicians at a pediatric hospital to identify\
        \ patients with unexplained pediatric-onset epilepsy. Exome sequencing was\
        \ performed for 522 patients and available biological parents, and sequencing\
        \ data were analyzed for single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and copy number\
        \ variants (CNVs). Variant pathogenicity was assessed, patients were provided\
        \ with their diagnostic results, and clinical utility was evaluated. Patients\
        \ were enrolled from August 2018 to October 2021, and data were analyzed through\
        \ December 2022.<h4>Exposures</h4>Phenotypic features associated with diagnostic\
        \ genetic results.<h4>Main outcomes and measures</h4>Main outcomes included\
        \ diagnostic yield and clinical utility. Diagnostic findings included variants\
        \ curated as pathogenic, likely pathogenic (PLP), or diagnostic variants of\
        \ uncertain significance (VUS) with clinical features consistent with the\
        \ involved gene's associated phenotype. The proportion of the cohort with\
        \ diagnostic findings, the genes involved, and their clinical utility, defined\
        \ as impact on clinical treatment, prognosis, or surveillance, are reported.<h4>Results</h4>A\
        \ total of 522 children (269 [51.5%] male; mean [SD] age at seizure onset,\
        \ 1.2 [1.4] years) were enrolled, including 142 children (27%) with developmental\
        \ epileptic encephalopathy and 263 children (50.4%) with intellectual disability.\
        \ Of these, 100 participants (19.2%) had identifiable genetic explanations\
        \ for their seizures: 89 participants had SNVs (87 germline, 2 somatic mosaic)\
        \ involving 69 genes, and 11 participants had CNVs. The likelihood of identifying\
        \ a genetic diagnosis was highest in patients with intellectual disability\
        \ (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 2.44; 95% CI, 1.40-4.26), early onset seizures\
        \ (aOR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.88-0.98), and motor impairment (aOR, 2.19; 95% CI\
        \ 1.34-3.58). Among 43 patients with apparently de novo variants, 2 were subsequently\
        \ determined to have asymptomatic parents harboring mosaic variants. Of 71\
        \ patients who received diagnostic results and were followed clinically, 29\
        \ (41%) had documented clinical utility resulting from their genetic diagnoses.<h4>Conclusions\
        \ and relevance</h4>These findings suggest that pediatric-onset epilepsy is\
        \ genetically heterogeneous and that some patients with previously unexplained\
        \ pediatric-onset epilepsy had genetic diagnoses with direct clinical implications.\"\

        \ limbs and loss of consciousness just after falling asleep without obvious\
        \ triggers. A novel heterozygous missense mutation c.2797C > T (p.Arg933Cys)\
        \ in exon 24 of the <i>KCNT1</i> was identified in the proband by whole-exome\
        \ sequencing and Sanger sequencing, and the clinical symptoms were compatible\
        \ with ADSHE. The proband's father has been showing similar symptoms for more\
        \ than 20 years and had the same site mutation. Her mother and sister were\
        \ physically and genetically normal. The study revealed a novel variant in\
        \ the <i>KCNT1</i> and expanded the mutation spectrum for this clinical condition.\
        \ Our results provide further evidence supporting a causative role in <i>KCNT1</i>\
        \ variants in ADSHE.\",\n      \"affiliation\": \"Department of Neurology,\

        \ identify the most relevant clinical and video-polysomnographic characteristics\
        \ of patients with sleep-related dissociative disorders (SRDDs) and to propose\
        \ a framework for new diagnostic criteria.<h4>Methods</h4>We searched potential\
        \ SRDD cases from the scientific literature and from a database of patients\
        \ referred for clinical and video-polysomnographic assessment in a single\
        \ sleep disorders center for disruptive nocturnal behaviors (n = 731). The\
        \ most relevant clinical and neurophysiological characteristics of the cases\
        \ were extracted and a descriptive analysis was performed.<h4>Results</h4>Twenty-six\
        \ SRDD cases (8 new and 18 previously published cases) were reviewed. Almost\
        \ all cases of SRDDs occurred in a context of past traumatic events or abuse\
        \ and were associated with at least 1 comorbid psychiatric disorder. We highlighted\
        \ 4 relevant clinical characteristics of SRDD useful for the differential\
        \ diagnosis with parasomnias: episodes of long duration of more than 1 hour\
        \ (90.9%), self-inflicted injuries (83.3%), occurrence while awake close to\
        \ bedtime (35.7%), and the presence of daytime dissociative symptoms (72.7%).\
        \ The video-polysomnography documented typical episodes of SRDD with prolonged\
        \ wakefulness before, during, and after the event in 11/26 cases. New diagnostic\
        \ criteria for SRDD were proposed, with 3 levels of certainty for the diagnosis\
        \ based on clinical, video-polysomnographic, and homemade video findings.<h4>Conclusions</h4>More\
        \ than 30 years after its formal identification, SRDD is not currently recognized\
        \ as an official diagnostic entity. We better delineate the clinical and neurophysiological\
        \ features of SRDD and propose a framework for its reinstatement in the next\
        \ revisions of the sleep and psychiatric disorders classifications.<h4>Citation</h4>Lopez\

        \ (VPSG) and prolonged video-EEG-monitoring (pVEEG-M) are neurophysiological\
        \ investigation modalities. Depending on indication either is performed, but\
        \ occasionally patients undergo both (during the same or separate stays).\
        \ We sought to assess the reasons and potential benefits of dual diagnostic\
        \ assessments with both modalities.<h4>Methods</h4>A retrospective chart-review\
        \ was performed to identify patients who underwent both VPSG and pVEEG-M during\
        \ the 10 year period between 2007 and 2017. One-hundred-nine patients were\
        \ identified who had undergone both studies. Patients were grouped according\
        \ to indication and outcome.<h4>Results</h4>One-hundred-nine patients had\
        \ both, a VPSG and pVEEG-M, in 62 (56.9%) the studies were performed because\
        \ of separate diagnoses independent from each other. In 47 patients (43.1%)\
        \ investigation with both modalities was needed to clarify the suspected diagnosis\
        \ or to refute differential diagnoses. Out of these 47, 11 (10.1% of the whole\
        \ group) arrived a new final diagnosis whereas in 36 (33%) the primary diagnosis\
        \ was corroborated with the second modality.<h4>Conclusions</h4>In the majority\
        \ of cases VPSG plus pVEEG-M were indicated to diagnose or monitor different\
        \ comorbid diseases (e.g. sleep-related breathing disorder and epilepsy).\
        \ In the other cases, performing both modalities was useful to achieve a higher\
        \ diagnostic accuracy or to refute differential diagnoses.<h4>Significance</h4>VPSG\
        \ and pVEEG-M are neurophysiological investigations which complement each\
        \ other, especially in case of two different comorbid diseases in a single\
        \ patient, to rule out differential diagnosis or when a higher diagnostic\
        \ certainty is seeked.\",\n      \"affiliation\": \"Department of Neurology,\

        \ epilepsy (SHE), previously called nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (NFLE),\
        \ is a focal epilepsy characterized by asymmetric tonic/dystonic posturing\
        \ and/or complex hyperkinetic seizures occurring mostly during sleep. SHE\
        \ fulfills the definition of rare disease with an estimated minimum prevalence\
        \ of 1.8/100,000 individuals, and it represents about 10% of drug-resistant\
        \ surgical cases. Although SHE and autosomal-dominant SHE (ADSHE) have been\
        \ considered benign epileptic conditions for a long time, emerging data have\
        \ shed light on the severity of this disorder and some peculiar features can\
        \ impact negatively on the quality of life of SHE patients. In fact, seizure\
        \ frequency can be very high, resulting in nocturnal sleep fragmentation with\
        \ possible diurnal consequences such as excessive sleepiness and fatigue.\
        \ Moreover, recent studies, adopting a systematic neuropsychological assessment,\
        \ have shown deficits in memory, executive functions and visuo-spatial abilities\
        \ in almost half of SHE patients. Intellectual disabilities and psychiatric\
        \ disorders have also been reported in some genetic forms. SHE may also exert\
        \ a negative effect on health-related quality of life, especially in domains\
        \ pertaining to a patient's role in the family, social context and patient's\
        \ illness experience. Despite a good response to pharmacological treatment,\
        \ especially with carbamazepine, 30% of SHE patients suffer from drug-resistant\
        \ seizures. Finally, recent studies suggest a poor prognosis in a high percentage\
        \ of SHE patients with a 20.4% cumulative probability of achieving terminal\
        \ remission at 10 years from onset. For selected drug-resistant SHE patients,\
        \ epilepsy surgery is the only treatment offering high probability of recovery,\
        \ both for seizures and for epilepsy-related sleep alterations.\",\n     \

        \ frontal lobe epilepsy) is a rare seizure disorder commonly misdiagnosed\
        \ or unrecognized, causing negative patient sequelae. While usually reported\
        \ in familial studies, it is more commonly acquired. Diagnosis is a challenge\
        \ due to its low incidence in comparison with the more common sleep disorders\
        \ or psychogenic etiologies in the differential diagnosis. Diagnosis is scaled\
        \ on degree of certainty based on described or clinically documented semiology,\
        \ with video EEG as a helpful, but not necessary, adjunct. Current treatment\
        \ is similar to other focal epilepsies. We studied a 36-year-old active duty\
        \ male soldier who presented with 2 years of predominantly sleep related,\
        \ abrupt, short, and anamnestic hyperkinetic movements with unstructured vocalizations.\
        \ Prior workup included non-contributory video electroencephalograph (EEG)\
        \ and polysomnography as well as normal brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\
        \ Treatments for presumed psychiatric and parasomnia disturbances were not\
        \ effective in establishing diagnosis or relief. Evaluation at our tertiary,\
        \ multidisciplinary care institution recorded events consistent with the diagnosis\
        \ of clinical SHE. He was enrolled in an advanced multishell diffusion-weighted\
        \ imaging MRI research study to evaluate white matter tracts, given his history\
        \ of mild, repetitive, non-penetrating traumatic brain injury, not otherwise\
        \ requiring hospitalization. Multishell diffusion MRI tractography found changes\
        \ not previously described in the right frontal lobe white matter tracts.\
        \ These changes were consistent with neurological localization and serve as\
        \ a potential nidus for this patient's seizure disorder. Misdiagnosis of SHE\
        \ can result in detrimental biopsychosocial sequelae of untreated epilepsy,\
        \ unnecessary or harmful intervention, or the stigmata of a behavioral disorder.\
        \ Further investigation into diagnosis and etiology of acquired SHE is needed.\
        \ Assessment for white matter abnormalities can potentially provide information\
        \ into pathogenesis of epilepsy disorders.\",\n      \"affiliation\": \"School\

        \ epilepsy is recognized worldwide and has been studied in a wide range of\
        \ clinical and scientific settings (epilepsy, sleep medicine, neurosurgery,\
        \ pediatric neurology, epidemiology, genetics). Though uncommon, it is of\
        \ considerable interest to practicing neurologists because of complexity in\
        \ differential diagnosis from more common, benign sleep disorders such as\
        \ parasomnias, or other disorders like psychogenic nonepileptic seizures.\
        \ Moreover, misdiagnosis can have substantial adverse consequences on patients'\
        \ lives. At present, there is no consensus definition of this disorder and\
        \ disagreement persists about its core electroclinical features and the spectrum\
        \ of etiologies involved. To improve the definition of the disorder and establish\
        \ diagnostic criteria with levels of certainty, a consensus conference using\
        \ formal recommended methodology was held in Bologna in September 2014. It\
        \ was recommended that the name be changed to sleep-related hypermotor epilepsy\
        \ (SHE), reflecting evidence that the attacks are associated with sleep rather\
        \ than time of day, the seizures may arise from extrafrontal sites, and the\
        \ motor aspects of the seizures are characteristic. The etiology may be genetic\
        \ or due to structural pathology, but in most cases remains unknown. Diagnostic\

        \ as nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy is recognized worldwide and has been\
        \ studied\\nin a wide range of clinical and scientific settings (epilepsy,\
        \ sleep medicine, neurosurgery, pediatric neu-\\nrology, epidemiology, genetics).\
        \ Though uncommon, it is of considerable interest to practicing neurol-\\\
        nogists because of complexity in differential diagnosis from more common,\
        \ benign sleep disorders such\\nas parasomnias, or other disorders like psychogenic\
        \ nonepileptic seizures. Moreover, misdiagnosis can\\nhave substantial adverse\
        \ consequences on patients’ lives. At present, there is no consensus definition\\\
        nof this disorder and disagreement persists about its core electroclinical\
        \ features and the spectrum of\\netiologies involved. To improve the definition\
        \ of the disorder and establish diagnostic criteria with\\nlevels of certainty,\
        \ a consensus conference using formal recommended methodology was held in\\\
        nBologna in September 2014. It was recommended that the name be changed to\
        \ sleep-related hyper-\\nmotor epilepsy (SHE), reflecting evidence that the\
        \ attacks are associated with sleep rather than time of\\nday, the seizures\
        \ may arise from extrafrontal sites, and the motor aspects of the seizures\
        \ are char-\\nacteristic. The etiology may be genetic or due to structural\
        \ pathology, but in most cases remains\\nunknown. Diagnostic criteria were\
        \ developed with 3 levels of certainty: witnessed (possible) SHE,\\nvideo-documented\
        \ (clinical) SHE, and video-EEG-documented (confirmed) SHE. The main research\
        \ gaps\\ninvolve epidemiology, pathophysiology, treatment, and prognosis.\

        n\\nThis disorder is of interest to a broad spec-\\ntrum of specialists, from\

        n\\nAccording to simple descriptors (table), the major-\\nity of studies were\
        \ of low quality. Most included fewer\\nthan 10 patients (57%), were case\
        \ series or case\\nreports (78%), and did not report a definition of\\nthe\
        \ syndrome (85%). Analytic designs (cohort, case-\\ncontrol) were used in\
        \ only 19% of studies. The topics\\nmost frequently considered were clinical\
        \ semiology\\n(71%), neurophysiology (68%), etiology (64%),\\ntherapy (51%),\
        \ and genetics (36%). Only 9% of\\nthe studies addressed epidemiology, diagnosis,\
        \ or\\nprognosis.\\n\\nNOMENCLATURE The 2 major outcomes of the\\nconsensus\
        \ conference were the need to change\\nnomenclature and the need to recognize\
        \ the disorder\\nas a distinct epilepsy syndrome.\\n\\nThe new name proposed\
        \ is sleep-related hypermo-\\ntor epilepsy (SHE). Although the name NFLE has\\\
        nhistorical significance, 3 critical\\nissues (discussed\\nand referenced\
        \ below), justified this change. First,\\n\\nterm nocturnal was\\n\\nthe\\\
        nconsidered misleading\\nbecause it implies a chronobiological pattern of\
        \ sei-\\nthat\\nzure occurrence, whereas evidence indicates\\noccurrence in\
        \ sleep is the most important characteris-\\ntic, whether at night or during\
        \ daytime naps. Second,\\nthe emphasis on localization to the frontal lobe\
        \ was\\nconsidered misleading in view of evidence that the\\ncharacteristic\
        \ seizures may also arise from other cere-\\nbral regions. Third, the original\
        \ name did not specify\\nthe typical clinical semiology involved, which consists\\\
        nprimarily of hypermotor\\nseizures, and may also\\ninclude attacks with predominantly\
        \ tonic or dystonic\\nfeatures. In proposing this name, the consensus panel\\\
        nrecognized a logical inconsistency in that the term hy-\\npermotor describes\
        \ a seizure type rather than an epi-\\nlepsy type; however, this is also true\
        \ of several other\\nwidely accepted syndrome names (e.g., progressive\\nmyoclonus\
        \ epilepsy, childhood absence epilepsy).\\nThe consensus was that the simplicity\
        \ and ease of\\nrecall of SHE was more important than this con-\\ncern. In\
        \ addition, although the consensus panel\\nacknowledged that the clinical\
        \ semiology of the\\nsyndrome is not fully captured by “hypermotor,”\\nthey\
        \ accepted this term because the full syndrome\\ndescription incorporates\
        \ additional details about\\nclinical presentation.\\n\\nAt the present state\
        \ of knowledge, SHE is best re-\\ngarded as a single syndrome; neither constellations\
        \ of\\nclinical features nor presence of comorbidities yet jus-\\ntifies the\
        \ delineation of separate syndromes within\\nSHE. Although SHE has diverse\
        \ etiologies,\\nit is\\ndefined by clinical manifestations (hypermotor seiz-\\\
        nures) possibly resulting from shared downstream\\nmechanisms occurring during\
        \ sleep/wake oscilla-\\ntion changes, suggesting a unique pathogenic net-\\\
        nwork.10,11,e6 Moreover, consideration of SHE as a\\nsingle syndrome is most\
        \ useful in clinical practice,\\nbecause the syndrome requires a distinct\
        \ diagnostic\\nand therapeutic approach.\\n\\nSo far, only the autosomal dominant\
        \ form of the\\nsyndrome (previously ADNFLE) is included within\\nthe guidelines\
        \ proposed by the International League\\nAgainst Epilepsy Commission on Classification\
        \ and\\nTerminology.12 Thus, the description of SHE within\\nthis article\
        \ expands the phenotype and clarifies iden-\\ntifying features of this syndrome\
        \ on the basis of avail-\\nable evidence.\\n\\nCLINICAL FEATURES Statements\

        \ rare form of focal epilepsy, with an\\nestimated minimum prevalence of 1.8/100,000\
        \ indi-\\nviduals, fulfilling the definition of rare disease.20 SHE\\naffects\
        \ both sexes, and involves sleep-related seizures\\nwith various motor manifestations.5,17\
        \ Seizure onset\\nmay be at any age with a peak during childhood and\\nadolescence.5,17\
        \ Seizure frequency may be very high,\\nwith occurrence either every night\
        \ or almost every\\nnight, usually many times per night.13,17 Clustering is\\\
        ncharacteristic but not obligatory for diagnosis. Seizures\\noccur predominantly\
        \ during sleep (and consequently\\nmost commonly during the night), primarily\
        \ in non-\\nREM (NREM) sleep and rarely during REM sleep.\\nSeizures during\
        \ active wakefulness may also occasion-\\nally occur during the patient’s\
        \ lifetime. The first occur-\\nrence of these seizures may precede, coincide,\
        \ or follow\\nthe onset of sleep-related seizures.17\\n\\nSeizures are abrupt\
        \ in onset and offset, typically\\nbrief (,2 minutes), and have a highly stereotyped\\\
        nmotor pattern within individuals.13–15,17 The primary\\nclinical expression\
        \ consists of “hypermotor” events,21\\ncharacterized by vigorous hyperkinetic\
        \ features (com-\\nplex body movements with kicking or cycling of limbs\\\
        nand rocking body movements7), usually with vegeta-\\ntive signs, vocalization,\
        \ and emotional facial expres-\\nsion.7,17 Asymmetric tonic/dystonic seizures\
        \ with or\\nwithout head/eye deviation are also observed.5,17\\n\\nSeizures\
        \ may be preceded by abrupt arousal or a\\ndistinct aura.5,18 Awareness of\
        \ episodes is not uncom-\\nmon.18,22 Typically, patients with SHE present\
        \ a\\nseries of sleep-related motor events becoming increas-\\ningly long\
        \ and complex, even on the same night.\\nClinical\\nfeatures range from brusque\
        \ stereotyped\\narousals (i.e., paroxysmal arousal17 or minor motor\\nevents23),\
        \ repeated throughout the night or arising\\nintermittently, with an almost\
        \ periodic pattern, to\\ncomplex hypermotor seizures as described above\\\
        nand, more seldom, protracted ambulatory behavior\\nknown as epileptic nocturnal\
        \ wandering.17,22,24,25\\nThese events can last longer than 2 minutes. These\\\
        ndifferent seizure manifestations tend to coincide in\\nthe same patient,\
        \ with the shorter events developing\\ninto more prolonged and complex attacks.17,22\
        \ Pa-\\ntients with SHE may complain of unsatisfactory sleep\\nand daytime\
        \ tiredness. However, they do not have\\nsignificantly more daytime sleepiness\
        \ than controls.26\\nDistinction from arousal parasomnias usually re-\\nlies\
        \ on clinical history (frequency, clustering, and\\ntiming with respect to\
        \ sleep onset of the attacks),16\\neven though EEG–polysomnography (PSG) may\
        \ be\\n\\nrequired in some challenging cases. A personal or\\nfamilial history\
        \ of arousal parasomnias is common\\nin patients with SHE, making shared pathophysio-\\\
        nlogic pathways plausible in these conditions.27,28\\n\\nThe majority of patients\
        \ have normal intelligence.\\nHowever, intellectual disability and behavior\
        \ disor-\\nders have been reported in SHE,29 especially in the\\nfamilial\
        \ form related to mutations in KCNT1,30 and\\nconsequently are not exclusion\
        \ criteria for SHE.\\n\\nResponse to medication has not been systematically\\\
        ninvestigated. Carbamazepine is effective at low doses in\\nsome patients\
        \ with SHE, but this therapy seems to be\\nineffective in at least one-third\
        \ of patients,17 making\\nthe response to antiepileptic drugs not discriminant\
        \ for\\nSHE diagnosis. Surgery has been found to be effective\\nin some patients\
        \ with severe, drug-resistant SHE\\nrelated to focal cortical dysplasia.13,31\
        \ Suspicion of a\\ngenetic cause does not contraindicate presurgical eval-\\\
        nuation, although data are still lacking on surgical out-\\ncomes in patients\
        \ with mutations in known genes.\\n\\nELECTROCLINICAL FEATURES Statements\
        \ regard-\\ning the electroclinical features of seizures in SHE are\\nbased\

        n\\nuninformative.5,13,17,19\\n\\n(cid:129) Prolonged video-EEG recording\
        \ is the best\\navailable diagnostic test to assess the occurrence\\nof seizures13,16\
        \ but, if negative, does not rule out\\nthe diagnosis because seizures may\
        \ not be re-\\ncorded and interictal EEG abnormalities may\\nbe absent.5,13,17,19\\\
        n\\n(cid:129) Sleep-related hypermotor\\n\\nseizures may arise\\nfrom various\
        \ frontal as well as from extrafrontal\\nareas.22,32–36\\n\\nIn many patients\
        \ with SHE, the interictal and ictal\\nscalp EEG features are uninformative,\
        \ especially\\nwhen seizures originate from the deep-seated cor-\\ntex.13,17\
        \ Prolonged video-EEG or, if available, PSG\\nrecording, is the best tool\
        \ to assess seizure occurrence\\nand is obligatory to characterize the abnormalities\
        \ in\\npatients undergoing presurgical investigation.13 Sleep\\nstaging by\
        \ PSG may serve to differentiate SHE seiz-\\nures from NREM parasomnias, the\
        \ latter usually aris-\\ning from stage 3 NREM sleep, even though this is\

        nexpert opinions and studies of Class III level.13,16,38\\n\\n(cid:129) Diagnosis\
        \ of SHE is primarily based on clinical\\nhistory. The absence of clear interictal\
        \ and ictal\\nEEG correlates, both during wakefulness and\\nsleep, does not\
        \ exclude the diagnosis of SHE.13\\n(cid:129) Certainty of diagnosis can be\
        \ categorized into\\n3 levels: witnessed (possible) SHE, video-\\ndocumented\
        \ (clinical) SHE, and video-EEG-\\ndocumented (confirmed) SHE.\\n\\nWitnessed\
        \ (possible) SHE. The main prerequisite to\\nsuspect the diagnosis of SHE\
        \ is the presence of seiz-\\nures consisting of obvious and disruptive hypermotor\\\
        nevents, as described above. The semiologic aspects of\\nsuch events, as provided\
        \ by an eyewitness, are gener-\\nally concordant with those documented by\
        \ video\\nanalysis.16 Hence, data from a good clinical history\\nare sufficient\
        \ to make the diagnosis of witnessed (pos-\\nsible) SHE.\\n\\nVideo-documented\
        \ (clinical) SHE. Clinically diagno-\\nsed SHE requires audio-video documentation\
        \ of\\nhypermotor events. In such a video recording, at\\nleast 1 event but\
        \ preferably 2 entire events should\\nbe documented (confirmed to be typical\
        \ by witness),\\nincluding the onset and with clear visualization of\\nthe\
        \ entire events, showing the evolution and offset\\nof the attacks. If the\
        \ captured episodes are minor\\nmotor events or paroxysmal arousals, and if\\\

        nfeatures.5,17,19 Autosomal dominant SHE (ADSHE;\\npreviously ADNFLE) is characterized\
        \ by marked\\nintrafamilial variation in severity.18 A minority of\\nfamilial\
        \ cases has a known genetic mutation. While\\nde novo mutations were first\
        \ identified in rare cases\\nmore than a decade ago,44 few sporadic cases\
        \ have a\\nknown genetic cause. Even in cases with a family\\nhistory, an\
        \ autosomal dominant pattern of inheri-\\ntance is not frequent; the mode\
        \ of inheritance is\\nunclear in most cases.\\n\\nIt was in ADSHE that the\
        \ first epilepsy gene,\\nCHRNA4, was discovered.6,18 This was the first of\
        \ 3\\ngenes encoding subunits of the neuronal acetylcho-\\nline receptor (nAChR)\
        \ to be implicated in ADSHE\\n(CHRNB2, CHRNA2).41,42 The phenotype produced\\\
        nby mutations of the 3 nAChR subunit genes is gen-\\nerally indistinguishable.46\
        \ A more severe form of\\nADSHE has been described in which some individ-\\\
        nuals have intellectual disability,\\nregression, and\\nbehavioral and psychiatric\
        \ disorders (depression, psy-\\nchosis, aggression, and personality disorder).29\
        \ Severe\\nADSHE has been associated with mutations of the\\nsodium-activated\
        \ potassium channel encoded by\\nKCNT1.30 Interestingly, the same gene is\
        \ mutated\\nin a far more severe epileptic encephalopathy, epilepsy\\nwith\
        \ migrating focal seizures of infancy (MFSI).47\\nFunctional studies show\

        n\\n\\fthis pathway may be more critical to common focal\\nepilepsy than previously\
        \ appreciated, suggesting that\\nmTOR inhibitors, which are effective in the\
        \ arche-\\ntypal mTORpathy, tuberous sclerosis, may have more\\nwidespread\
        \ application in focal epilepsies.53\\n\\nRESEARCH NEEDS The main research\
        \ gaps in SHE\\nregard epidemiology, pathophysiology, prognosis,\\ngenetics,\
        \ and targeted therapy.\\n\\nPopulation-based studies are needed to estimate\\\
        nthe incidence and prevalence of SHE20 and could\\nalso be used to provide\
        \ critical information about\\nprognosis and remission rates, comorbidities,\
        \ and\\nmortality compared to other focal epilepsies. Multi-\\ncenter studies\
        \ of the familial co-occurrence of SHE\\nwith arousal parasomnias are needed\
        \ to elucidate\\npotential shared genetic susceptibility to these 2\\ndisorders.27\\\
        n\\nIn a retrospective cohort of patients with SHE,\\nincidence of sudden\
        \ unexpected death in epilepsy\\n(SUDEP) was 0.36 per 1,000 person-years,\
        \ not higher\\nthan in prevalent epilepsy populations.54 This paucity\\nof\
        \ reported SUDEP in SHE is notable, given the daily\\noccurrence of seizures\
        \ during sleep and the previous\\ndemonstration that occurrence of nocturnal\
        \ seizures is\\na risk factor for SUDEP after adjustment for general-\\nized\
        \ tonic-clonic seizures.55 The lower than expected\\nrisk of SUDEP in SHE\
        \ might reflect a low occurrence\\nof generalized tonic-clonic seizures in\
        \ SHE.54\\n\\nImproved structured instruments for clinical diag-\\nnosis of\
        \ SHE are needed for epidemiologic and\\ngenetic studies. Multicenter studies\
        \ are needed to elu-\\ncidate the SHE spectrum and natural history, ranging\\\
        nfrom clear-cut cases to atypical forms overlapping\\nwith parasomnias. Home\
        \ video recordings during\\nsleep may also have utility for improving diagnostic\\\
        naccuracy, and additional multicenter\\nstudies are\\nneeded to validate this\
        \ approach. Although a key\\nrole of genetic factors is well-known in autosomal\\\
        ndominant SHE, a minority of familial cases and rare\\nsporadic cases have\
        \ a known genetic cause. Next-\\ngeneration sequencing will enable the identification\\\
        nof additional susceptibility genes in SHE, and the fre-\\nquency of mutations\
        \ in specific genes can subse-\\nquently be established through targeted mutation\\\
        ntesting in large cohorts. Family studies may also pro-\\nvide insights into\
        \ genetically based phenotypic varia-\\ntion and alternative inheritance patterns\
        \ of SHE such\\nas recessive or polygenic models.\\n\\nThe increasingly recognized\
        \ role of de novo and\\nsomatic mutations in human disease is highly relevant\\\
        nto SHE.56 Sporadic cases may have de novo mutations\\nof genes with high\
        \ penetrance or genes with smaller\\neffects conferring risk in polygenic\
        \ or multifactorial\\nsettings. The identification of postzygotic, somatic\\\
        nmutations in brain as causes of malformations such\\n\\nas hemimegalencephaly57,58\
        \ suggests that other brain\\ndiseases may be due to somatic mutations. Such\
        \ mu-\\ntations may be identifiable only in brain tissue from\\npatients undergoing\
        \ epilepsy surgery, or may be pre-\\nsent in other tissues such as blood and\
        \ saliva due to\\nmosaicism.\\n\\nSome individuals in families with DEPDC5\
        \ muta-\\ntions have malformations of cortical development, espe-\\ncially\
        \ focal cortical dysplasia.59 Given the role of\\nDEPDC5 as an inhibitor of\
        \ the mTOR pathway, a\\nkey question is whether a second-hit mutation is pre-\\\
        nsent in the brain tissue of an individual with a DEPDC5\\nmutation. This\
        \ can be addressed with whole-exome\\nsequencing of tissue removed for refractory\
        \ epilepsy\\nand may improve understanding of the molecular\\npathology of\
        \ malformations of cortical development.\\n\\nFinally, genetic findings may\
        \ serve as the basis for\\ndevelopment of targeted therapies for SHE. An early\\\
        nexample of the potential of this approach is the success-\\nful use of quinidine\
        \ for treatment of a patient with an\\nepileptic encephalopathy caused by\
        \ a de novo KCNT1\\nmutation,60 following the finding that it reverses the\\\
        ngain of function of the mutant potassium channel\\nin vitro.30,48 These and\

              \ Various definitions of biological complexity have been proposed: the\
              \ number of genes, cell types, or metabolic\\nprocesses within an organism.\
              \ As knowledge of biological systems has increased, it has become apparent\
              \ that these metrics\\nare often incongruent. Methodology. Here we propose\
              \ an alternative complexity metric based on the number of genetically\\\
              nuncorrelated phenotypic traits contributing to an organism’s fitness.\
              \ This metric, phenotypic complexity, is more objective\\nthan previous\
              \ suggestions, as complexity is measured from a fundamental biological\
              \ perspective, that of natural selection. We\\nutilize a model linking\
              \ the equilibrium fitness (drift load) of a population to phenotypic\
              \ complexity. We then use results from\\nviral evolution experiments\
              \ to compare the phenotypic complexities of two viruses, the bacteriophage\
              \ X174 and vesicular\\nstomatitis virus, and to illustrate the consistency\
              \ of our approach and its applicability. Conclusions/Significance. Because\\\
              nDarwinian evolution through natural selection is the fundamental element\
              \ unifying all biological organisms, we propose that\\nour metric of\
              \ complexity is potentially a more relevant metric than others, based\
              \ on the count of artificially defined set of\\nobjects.\\n\\nCitation:\

              \ doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0000217\\n\\nINTRODUCTION\\nA persistent\
              \ question in biology is how organismal complexity\\nthrough the course\
              \ of evolution [1–5]. Although\\nchanges\\nsignificant progress has\
              \ been made in the understanding and\\nquantifying organismal characteristics\
              \ at many level of organiza-\\ntion (DNA, proteins, metabolic networks,\
              \ cellular organization,\\norgan functions,\\nindividual behavior) much\
              \ confusion remains\\nabout how to accurately quantify organismal complexity.\
              \ Several\\nintuitive proposals have been made that take into account\
              \ simple\\nmetrics such as the number of genes or cell types. However,\
              \ these\\nsimple measures quickly lead to conflicting conclusions [2,3].\
              \ Here\\nwe propose a fundamentally different approach to measuring\\\
              norganismal complexity; as opposed to relying on bottom-up\\nmeasures\
              \ such as the number of genes an organism has, we utilize\\nan objective\
              \ biological approach: natural selection. Instead of\\nasking how complex\
              \ an organism is from our own perspective, we\\nask: how complex is\
              \ an organism from the perspective of natural\\nselection? Essentially,\
              \ this is a top-down metric of organismal\\ncomplexity that we term\
              \ phenotypic complexity.\\n\\nPhenotypic complexity quantifies the number\
              \ of genetically\\nuncorrelated phenotypic traits contributing to an\
              \ organism’s\\nfitness. A phenotypic trait contributes to an organism’s\
              \ fitness\\nonly to the extent that natural selection acts upon that\
              \ trait. Thus\\nan organismal phenotype that is no longer under selection\
              \ (for\\nexample during an evolutionary transition from a generalist\
              \ to\\nspecialist lifestyle), although expressed by the organism, contri-\\\
              ntwo\\nbutes nothing to organismal complexity. Secondly,\\nphenotypes\
              \ contribute to complexity, they must be genetically\\nseparable: some\
              \ mutations must exist that affect one phenotype\\nbut not the other.\
              \ If no such mutations exist, then although we\\nmay perceive two phenotypes\
              \ under selection, these phenotypes\\ncontribute only a single trait\\\
              ntoward determining phenotypic\\ncomplexity. As an example consider\
              \ the affinity of an enzyme for\\na substrate, and the rate at which\
              \ that substrate is converted to\\nproduct. If there are no mutations\
              \ that affect one of these traits but\\nnot the other, then these two\
              \ phenotypes are considered one, until\\n\\nif\\n\\nthe organism gains\
              \ the genetic complexity to generate variation in\\none phenotype without\
              \ affecting the second,\\nfor example by\\nevolving functionally separate\
              \ domains in the enzyme. Phenotypic\\ncomplexity is thus a combined\
              \ description of how natural selection\\nperceives organismal phenotypes\
              \ and how phenotypic variation is\\ngenerated by the organism. This\
              \ concept was first articulated by\\nOrr, and followed later by others\
              \ [6–8]. Notably, it is similar to\\nthe amount of\\nphysical complexity,\
              \ which is a measure of\\ninformation that an organism encodes about\
              \ its environment [4,5].\\nAn important aspect of measuring complexity\
              \ in this manner is\\nthat both the organism and the environment affect\
              \ the metric. An\\norganism with many phenotypes, but living in simple\
              \ environment\\ncould thus be just as complex as a simpler organism\
              \ in the same\\nenvironment. For example,\\nif one organism is capable\
              \ of\\nmetabolizing both lactose and glucose, while second can\\nmetabolize\
              \ only glucose, the first organism will only be designated\\nas more\
              \ complex when there is a possibility that lactose will be\\npresent\
              \ in the environment.\\n\\nAcademic Editor: Angus Buckling, Oxford University,\

              n\\n\\fRecent population genetic theory [9,10] has suggested that\\\
              nphenotypic complexity is proportional to the drift load, a quantity\\\
              nthat describes how equilibrium mean population fitness declines\\nwith\
              \ population size. This can be intuitively understood in the\\nfollowing\
              \ manner. An organism’s fitness is a result of how\\nsuccessfully it\
              \ interacts with the environment. As the number of\\ninteractions (traits)\
              \ increases, it becomes difficult to simultaneously\\nmaintain each\
              \ one. Very large populations maintain nearly\\noptimal mean population\
              \ fitness regardless of phenotypic com-\\nplexity. Small populations\
              \ can maintain high average fitness only\\nwhen there are a small number\

              \ amount to fitness; if there are a large\\nnumber of traits (high complexity),\
              \ each contributing only a small\\namount to fitness, then small populations\
              \ will be incapable of\\nmaintaining all of them. Thus for complex organisms,\
              \ there will be\\na large difference in mean fitness between small and\
              \ large\\npopulations; for simple organisms, this difference in average\
              \ fitness\\nwill be small.\\n\\nfirst\\n\\nThe phenotypic model used\
              \ to link drift load to phenotypic\\ncomplexity was\\nformalized by\
              \ R. A. Fisher [11]. He\\nenvisioned a multidimensional phenotypic space\
              \ in which the\\norigin of each axis corresponded to the most-fit or\
              \ optimum\\nphenotypic value. As phenotypic values depart from the origin,\\\
              nfitness decreases. The manner in which fitness declines is described\\\
              nby a monotonically decreasing function, which may take a variety\\\
              nof shapes, e.g., linear, concave-up, or –down. Individuals of equal\\\
              nfitness but different phenotypic values trace out fitness isoclines\
              \ in\\nthe space. If an organism has only two phenotypes, the phenotypic\\\
              nspace is two-dimensional and the fitness isoclines are a series of\\\
              ncircles centered on the origin of the axes (Fig. 1). If an organism\\\
              nhas n number of phenotypes, phenotypic space is n-dimensional,\\nand\
              \ each fitness\\nisocline is an n-dimensional hyper-sphere.\\nBecause\
              \ of the assumed geometry of the isoclines, this model is\\nreferred\
              \ to as Fisher’s Geometric Model (FGM) of phenotypic or\\nadaptive evolution.\\\
              n\\nA population of individuals can be represented as a collection of\\\
              npoints in FGM and the phenotypic values of each point allow\\nascertainment\
              \ of the fitness of each individual. Individual fitness\\nthen determines\
              \ the probability of each individual surviving and\\nreproducing the\
              \ next generation. Evolution is thus described in\\nFGM by following\
              \ the collection of points over many generations.\\nTo generate novel\
              \ genetic variation, mutations are drawn from an\\nassumed distribution\
              \ that is centered on the phenotypic position of\\neach individual (Fig.\
              \ 1). By never descending into genotypic space,\\nFGM is analogous to\
              \ quantitative genetics models. Both types of\\nmodels assume or require\
              \ only that a component of phenotype is\\nheritable. However, whereas\
              \ quantitative genetic models represent\\npopulations by their mean\
              \ and variance, FGM is an individual-\\nbased model in which each individual\
              \ is evaluated according to its\\nfitness.\\n\\nFGM makes a set of\\\

              \ of intrinsically beneficial or\\nintrinsically deleterious mutations\
              \ have all been observed during\\nlaboratory evolution, and all conform\

              \ of mathematical simplicity), recent\\nexperimental studies do not\
              \ seem to support the use of such\\na function [17–19]. Linear fitness\
              \ functions give rise to dramatic\\nsynergistic epistasis. For example,\
              \ a mutation that increases the\\ndistance to the optimal phenotype\
              \ by 0.1 units may decrease\\nfitness by 10% in the optimal genotype\
              \ (which by definition has\\na fitness of 1); an analogous mutation\
              \ will decrease fitness by 50%\\nin an organism with a fitness of 0.2;\
              \ this mutation will become\\nin any genotype with a fitness less than\
              \ 0.1. Recent\\nlethal\\nexperimental work suggests that epistasis between\
              \ deleterious\\nmutations is either antagonistic [17–19] or null [20].\
              \ We therefore\\ndecided to use a family of exponential\\nfitness functions\
              \ with\\na parameter that allows control over the level and shape of\\\

              nin which fitness is an exponentially decaying\\nfunction of the distance\

              \ during the\\ncourse of evolution, a metric is needed. Previously,\

              \ Here we suggest that a metric unifying biological systems\\nhas not\
              \ been appropriately identified. To circumvent this problem,\\nwe have\
              \ developed a metric of biological complexity termed\\nphenotypic complexity\
              \ (ne). We have quantified this metric in the\\nviruses wX174 and VSV\
              \ by utilizing a population genetic model\\nthat describes how phenotypic\
              \ complexity affects the drift load that\\na population experiences.\\\

              \ is\\nthe fundamental element unifying all biological\\norganisms,\

              nUsing recent theoretical results we have analytically quantified the\\\
              ndependency of the drift load (equilibrium fitness) on the effective\\\
              npopulation size and phenotypic complexity. The linear fitness\\nfunction\
              \ that has been employed previously to simplify the\\nmathematical analyses\
              \ is no longer necessary. Such a function\\nmakes strong assumptions\
              \ about the form of the fitness landscape;\\nspecifically, mutational\
              \ effects become very large as fitness is\\nreduced. Thus at low fitness\
              \ most mutations are either lethal or of\\nvery large effect, a scenario\
              \ which is incompatible with what we\\nhave previously observed [14].\\\
              n\\nWe have therefore studied a more general family of fitness\\nfunctions\
              \ of the form f(d) = exp(2(dQ)), and found that Feq(Ne,\\nne) = (12(2?Ne21)21)(ne/Q).\
              \ It appears that this equation remains\\nvalid over a much wider range\
              \ of conditions than those used in the\\ncanonical FGM, in which mutations\
              \ are required to be isotropic\\nand fitness isoclines are symmetric\
              \ about the origin. An interesting\\nfeature of this formula is that\
              \ it does not require a model in which\\nmutations can affect all phenotypic\
              \ traits simultaneously. In the\\ninitial formulation of FGM, all phenotypic\
              \ axes intersect at the\\norigin of each axis. This original FGM can\
              \ be modified slightly\\nsuch that some phenotypes are grouped into\
              \ separate phenotypic\\nmodules, and within a module, all phenotypes\
              \ again intersect at\\neach other’s origin. Any mutation that occurs\
              \ within a module can\\naffect only other phenotypes within that module,\
              \ and none that lie\\noutside of it (i.e. there is no pleiotropy between\
              \ modules, an idea\\nsimilar to previous conceptions of modularity [23]).\
              \ Using the\\nmore general description of the equilibrium drift load\
              \ that we have\\nderived above, a phenotypic landscape a composed of\
              \ a single\\nmodule with ne dimensions has the same drift load function\
              \ as\\na landscape composed of m independent modules of size ne,i with\\\
              nSi ne,i = ne because we have\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n1{ 2Ne{1\\nÞ\\n\\nð\\n\\\

              nð\\n\\n(cid:2)ne,i=Q\\n\\n{1\\n\\nð6Þ\\n\\nHence the drift load formula\
              \ that we have obtained seems to be\\n\\nrobust to many of the assumptions\
              \ underlying FGM.\\n\\nOther Attempts to Estimate Phenotypic Complexity\\\
              nRecently, another theoretical study developed a framework to\\nestimate\
              \ phenotypic complexity [21]. The model developed used\\npredictions\
              \ on the distribution of mutational effects to estimate\\ncomplexity.\
              \ This analysis, which is completely independent from\\nours, found\
              \ an interesting correlation between gene number and\\ncomplexity in\
              \ a variety of organisms ranging from a virus to C.\\nelegans. However,\
              \ for all the organisms for which enough data\\nthe number of phenotypic\\\
              nexisted to perform the analysis,\\ndimensions estimated was very small;\
              \ 0.21 phenotypic dimensions\\nfor E. coli, 1.07 in VSV, 1–2 for S.\
              \ cerevisiae, and 2–3 for D.\\nmelanogaster and C. elegans. We think\
              \ that several effects may limit\\nthe predictive quality such a method.\
              \ Firstly, mutation accumu-\\nlation methods and the inherent noise\
              \ in fitness estimates are very\\ndifferent across species and comparison\
              \ across species are thus\\ndifficult. One illustration of this is the\
              \ large variability in fitness\\nestimates for mutations in a single\
              \ species using two methods: in\\nVSV earlier estimates (using Bateman-Mukai\
              \ estimates) predicted\\na 0.002 mean fitness effect per mutation, while\
              \ more recent and\\naccurate estimates (which introduced each mutation\
              \ individually)\\nbrought the estimate it to 14% (a 70-fold difference).\
              \ Secondly,\\nneutral mutations are not considered in the model developed\
              \ by\\nMartin and Lenormand. However, part of the mutation produced\\\
              n\\nPopulation Genetic Complexity\\n\\ntherefore be taken into account\\\
              n\\nby transposable elements might affect genes useless in laboratory\\\
              nconditions and will\\nin the\\ncalculation of mean fitness effects\
              \ of mutations even if they do\\nnot affect any phenotype in the laboratory\
              \ environment. Third,\\ncontrary to our model, if phenotypes are organized\
              \ in different\\nmodules (as many data suggest), their model will provide\
              \ different\\nestimates; in other words, their model requires that all\
              \ traits can be\\nsimultaneously affected by a single mutations. All\
              \ these considera-\\ntions suggest that a second independent model should\
              \ be used to\\nestimate phenotypic complexity.\\n\\nOne of the central\
              \ FGM hypotheses that we have so far not\\naddressed is the single-peaked\
              \ nature of the landscape. Although\\nFGM contains few assumptions about\
              \ the nature of the genotypic\\nlandscape, the model explicitly requires\
              \ a phenotypic landscape\\ncontaining a single peak; without this, then\
              \ the fitness function,\\nf(d), cannot be described by a decreasing\
              \ function. However,\\nrecent experimental evidence over large evolutionary\
              \ time scales\\nstrongly suggests that while the genotypic landscape\
              \ may contain\\nmultiple peaks, the phenotypic landscape is generally\
              \ much less\\ncomplex. Several experimental studies using microbes have\
              \ shown\\nthat a considerable amount of phenotypic convergence occurs\\\
              nduring evolution [24–27], even when organisms begin from\\ndifferent\
              \ starting points in the landscape [28]. These phenomena\\nwould only\
              \ be expected if the phenotypic landscape exhibited\\na single-peak.\
              \ However, the evidence for ruggedness in the genetic\\nlandscape is\
              \ also substantial, especially in experiments that have\\nlooked at\
              \ bacterial evolution of resistance to antibiotics [29]. In\\nthis case,\
              \ the fitness relationships between the wild type genotypes,\\nresistant\
              \ genotypes, compensated resistant genotypes, and sensitive\\ngenotypes\
              \ bearing the compensatory mutation exhibit high levels\\nof epistasis,\
              \ characteristic of a rugged genetic landscape. In other\\nin which\
              \ the cost of resistance was associated with\\nstudies\\na phenotype\
              \ [30],\\nfitness restoration to wild-type level was\\nsometimes observed\
              \ and, more importantly for our concern, it\\nthe phenotypic damage\\\
              nwas associated with a restoration of\\nthe resistance mutation\\nassociated\
              \ with the occurrence of\\n(transcription efficiency of\\nrifampicin\
              \ resistant mutants was\\nrestored back to the level observed in rifampicin\
              \ sensitive strain).\\nThis also suggests the singularity of the phenotypic\
              \ optimum,\\nalthough different genetic combinations may underlie this\\\
              nis focusing neither on the\\noptimum. However, as our model\\ngenetic\
              \ nature of the adaptive landscape, nor on the rate of\\nadaptation\
              \ (ruggedness means that several mutations could be\\nneeded to restore\
              \ the effect of one) it should not be too sensitive to\\nthe small level\
              \ ruggedness of the genetic landscape described so\\nfar.\\n\\nThe Concept\
              \ of Phenotypic Complexity\\nAs discussed previously, the quantity denoted\
              \ by ne is the number\\nof genetically uncorrelated phenotypes that\
              \ are influenced by the\\naction of natural selection. The dimensions\
              \ enumerated by ne are\\nthus genetically orthogonal to each other,\
              \ and analogous to the\\naxes needed to describe the variation among\
              \ multiple phenotypes\\nmeasured on a collection of individuals and\
              \ mutants in a principal\\ncomponent analysis. However, the number of\
              \ axes enumerated by\\nne is filtered by natural selection, while in\
              \ a PCA analysis the\\nnumber of axes is limited only by the number\
              \ of independent\\nphenotypes\\nthat are measured. Because each phenotype\
              \ is\\noptimized at a value determined by each organism’s ecological\\\
              nenvironment, there is a dependence of phenotypic complexity on\\nthe\
              \ complexity of\\nthe ecological niche experienced by each\\norganism;\
              \ if natural selection does not act on a phenotype, then\\nthat phenotype\
              \ does not contribute to the complexity metric.\\nFinally, although\
              \ the estimates of ne arise from an idealized model\\n\\nPLoS ONE |\

              n\\n\\fof phenotypic evolution; as Orr suggested previously, estimates\
              \ of\\nphenotypic complexity using FGM can be viewed as ‘‘effective’’\\\
              nestimates of phenotypic complexity [6]. This concept is analogous\\\
              nto the concept in population genetics of effective population size,\\\
              nNe, in which two populations with different numbers of individuals\\\
              nand different sex ratios might have the same effective population\\\
              nsize and therefore respond similarly to the different population\\\
              ngenetic forces. Thus two organisms, although they may differ in\\nboth\
              \ the underlying genetic mechanisms and in the complexity of\\nthe environment\
              \ in which they live, may have similar phenotypic\\ncomplexities. The\
              \ utility of the concept lies not in the implications\\nit makes about\
              \ specific phenotypes or genetic details, but in that it\\nenables a\
              \ general quantification of how an organism is affected by\\nnatural\
              \ selection (the complexity with which natural selection acts),\\nand\
              \ furthermore, how this action affects\\nthe evolutionary\\ndynamics\
              \ of that organism [6].\\n\\nViral Estimates of Phenotypic Complexity\\\
              nUnsurprisingly, our estimates of phenotypic complexity are orders\\\
              nof magnitude smaller than either the number of nucleotides or\\neven\
              \ the number of amino acids encoded by the genomes of these\\norganisms\
              \ (5386 bp and 11,161bp in wX174 and VSV, respec-\\ntively). This agrees\
              \ with the concept of phenotypic complexity that\\nwe have defined.\
              \ Although mutations that occur at one nucleotide\\nor amino acid do\
              \ not affect\\nthey are\\ngenetically separable phenotypes), it is clearly\
              \ unlikely that each\\nnucleotide or amino acid is independently acted\
              \ up by natural\\nselection. Secondly, each estimate of complexity is\
              \ greater than the\\nnumber of genes encoded by each virus (11 and 5\
              \ for wX174 and\\nVSV, respectively). The presence of multiple functional\
              \ domains\\nwithin a single protein is consistent with an estimate of\
              \ complexity\\nthat is greater than the number of encoded proteins.\\\
              n\\nthose at another (i.e.\\n\\nAlthough we have only two estimates,\
              \ we can briefly consider\\nthem from a comparative standpoint: although\
              \ the genome size of\\nwX174 is half of VSV, our estimate of phenotypic\
              \ complexity\\nquantifies wX174 as being approximately four-fold more\
              \ complex.\\nIt is notable, then, that wX174 contains approximately\
              \ twice the\\nnumber of genes as VSV. Additionally, the lifestyle of\
              \ wX174 is\\narguably much more elaborate than that of VSV. wX174 interacts\\\
              nwith several host factors in order to perform transcription and\\nreplication;\
              \ 13 host factors are required for replication alone [31].\\nThis can\
              \ be contrasted with VSV, in which transcription and\\nreplication are\
              \ similar processes, both performed by the viral\\npolymerase. Few host\\\
              nfactors (and thus few interactions) are\\nnecessary at all during the\
              \ entire life cycle of VSV [32].\\n\\nThese estimates suggest that,\
              \ for very simple organisms such as\\nviruses, phenotypic complexity\
              \ correlates well with the number of\\ngenes in an organism, and more\
              \ specifically, with the number of\\ninteractions characteristic of\
              \ that organism [2]. This observation\\nsupports the idea that phenotypic\
              \ complexity depends on the\\ninteractions between an organism and its\
              \ environment. Genome\\nsize in itself seems to be a poor correlate\
              \ of phenotypic complexity,\\na notable result in consideration of the\
              \ very small genome sizes of\\nthese organisms. Whether\\nsuch correlations\
              \ or absence of\\ncorrelation with gene number or genome length would\
              \ hold for\\nmore complex organisms remains an open question. Nevertheless,\\\
              nby studying very simple organisms, we have shown that the use of\\\
              ndrift load could be used to estimate complexity in a novel and\\nconsistent\
              \ way. We now propose that such a method could be\\nhelpful to identify\
              \ and quantify the strongest determinants of\\nbiological complexity\
              \ of higher organisms.\\n\\nAlthough the theory presented here appears\
              \ to be quite robust,\\nit is too early to conclude that it is an accurate\
              \ reflection of the\\nunderlying biology. To be studied in an FGM framework,\\\
              n\\nPopulation Genetic Complexity\\n\\nfor population size-dependent\\\
              n\\norganisms need to present at least one phenotypic property to\\\

              nis explicitly\\nshould evolve towards a fitness equilibrium that\\\
              ndependent on population size. We found data in the literature\\nconsistent\
              \ with this expectation for one organism, VSV. We now\\nprovide further\
              \ support\\nfitness\\nequilibria by evolving populations of the bacteriophage\
              \ wX174.\\nTogether, these two data sets suggest that evolutionary analyses\\\
              nusing an FGM framework are a valid approach. Moreover, the use\\nof\
              \ very simple organisms such as viruses is useful for gaining insight\\\
              ninto metrics of complexity, as for such simple organisms, gene\\nnumber\
              \ is likely to be a very good correlate of organismal\\ncomplexity,\
              \ and this should be reflected by the metric. Although\\nour observations\

              \ in a greater number of\\norganisms is needed before further conclusions\
              \ can be drawn.\\n\\nConclusions\\nHere we have presented a top-down\
              \ approach to quantifying\\nbiological complexity. This can be contrasted\
              \ with previously\\nproposed metrics of complexity, which have relied\
              \ on physically\\nmeasurable quantities of the organism (bottom-up approaches).\\\
              nTwo important conceptual differences separate these two ap-\\nproaches.\
              \ Most importantly, phenotypic complexity is dependent\\non both the\
              \ organism and the environmental context. An\\norganism is not complex\
              \ because it has many measurable\\nphenotypes; it is complex because\
              \ it has many phenotypes on\\nwhich natural selection acts. Secondly,\
              \ phenotypic complexity\\ndoes not rely on artificially constructed\
              \ concepts such as genes\\n[33]. As an example, if two genes are deemed\
              \ to be of equal\\nsuch a\\ncomplexity because they are functionally\
              \ equivalent,\\nmeasure necessarily ignores the subtle ways in which\
              \ each may\\nbe regulated, or spliced, or expressed within the cell.\
              \ Quantify-\\ning such multiple layers of complexity is difficult if\
              \ the metric\\nrelies on physically measurable quantities.\\n\\nHowever,\
              \ phenotypic complexity remains an inherently abstract\\nmetric. It\
              \ cannot aid in identifying the specific characteristics\\ncontributing\
              \ to the complexity of an organism. Instead, it addresses\\nthe complexity\
              \ with which natural selection views an organism, and\\nthe complexity\
              \ with which an organism is capable of generating\\nnovel phenotypic\
              \ variation. For this reason, testing how phenotypic\\ncomplexity compares\
              \ to more traditional metrics of complexity (for\\nexample, the numbers\
              \ of genes, protein interactions, or cellular\\npathways) may provide\
              \ significant insight into biological systems.\\nFinally, phenotypic\
              \ complexity (and the resulting equilibrium drift\\nload) affords a\
              \ unique opportunity to contrast the action of natural\\nselection between\
              \ different organisms or different environments in\\na very general\
              \ and unconstrained manner.\\n\\nMETHODS\\nViral Evolution\\nThe details\

        \ of biological complexity have been proposed: the number of genes, cell types,\
        \ or metabolic\\nprocesses within an organism. As knowledge of biological\
        \ systems has increased, it has become apparent that these metrics\\nare often\
        \ incongruent. Methodology. Here we propose an alternative complexity metric\
        \ based on the number of genetically\\nuncorrelated phenotypic traits contributing\
        \ to an organism’s fitness. This metric, phenotypic complexity, is more objective\\\
        nthan previous suggestions, as complexity is measured from a fundamental biological\
        \ perspective, that of natural selection. We\\nutilize a model linking the\
        \ equilibrium fitness (drift load) of a population to phenotypic complexity.\
        \ We then use results from\\nviral evolution experiments to compare the phenotypic\
        \ complexities of two viruses, the bacteriophage X174 and vesicular\\nstomatitis\

        \ persistent question in biology is how organismal complexity\\nthrough the\
        \ course of evolution [1–5]. Although\\nchanges\\nsignificant progress has\
        \ been made in the understanding and\\nquantifying organismal characteristics\
        \ at many level of organiza-\\ntion (DNA, proteins, metabolic networks, cellular\
        \ organization,\\norgan functions,\\nindividual behavior) much confusion remains\\\
        nabout how to accurately quantify organismal complexity. Several\\nintuitive\
        \ proposals have been made that take into account simple\\nmetrics such as\
        \ the number of genes or cell types. However, these\\nsimple measures quickly\
        \ lead to conflicting conclusions [2,3]. Here\\nwe propose a fundamentally\
        \ different approach to measuring\\norganismal complexity; as opposed to relying\
        \ on bottom-up\\nmeasures such as the number of genes an organism has, we\
        \ utilize\\nan objective biological approach: natural selection. Instead of\\\
        nasking how complex an organism is from our own perspective, we\\nask: how\
        \ complex is an organism from the perspective of natural\\nselection? Essentially,\
        \ this is a top-down metric of organismal\\ncomplexity that we term phenotypic\
        \ complexity.\\n\\nPhenotypic complexity quantifies the number of genetically\\\
        nuncorrelated phenotypic traits contributing to an organism’s\\nfitness. A\
        \ phenotypic trait contributes to an organism’s fitness\\nonly to the extent\
        \ that natural selection acts upon that trait. Thus\\nan organismal phenotype\
        \ that is no longer under selection (for\\nexample during an evolutionary\
        \ transition from a generalist to\\nspecialist lifestyle), although expressed\
        \ by the organism, contri-\\ntwo\\nbutes nothing to organismal complexity.\
        \ Secondly,\\nphenotypes contribute to complexity, they must be genetically\\\
        nseparable: some mutations must exist that affect one phenotype\\nbut not\
        \ the other. If no such mutations exist, then although we\\nmay perceive two\
        \ phenotypes under selection, these phenotypes\\ncontribute only a single\
        \ trait\\ntoward determining phenotypic\\ncomplexity. As an example consider\
        \ the affinity of an enzyme for\\na substrate, and the rate at which that\
        \ substrate is converted to\\nproduct. If there are no mutations that affect\
        \ one of these traits but\\nnot the other, then these two phenotypes are considered\
        \ one, until\\n\\nif\\n\\nthe organism gains the genetic complexity to generate\
        \ variation in\\none phenotype without affecting the second,\\nfor example\
        \ by\\nevolving functionally separate domains in the enzyme. Phenotypic\\\
        ncomplexity is thus a combined description of how natural selection\\nperceives\
        \ organismal phenotypes and how phenotypic variation is\\ngenerated by the\
        \ organism. This concept was first articulated by\\nOrr, and followed later\
        \ by others [6–8]. Notably, it is similar to\\nthe amount of\\nphysical complexity,\
        \ which is a measure of\\ninformation that an organism encodes about its environment\
        \ [4,5].\\nAn important aspect of measuring complexity in this manner is\\\
        nthat both the organism and the environment affect the metric. An\\norganism\
        \ with many phenotypes, but living in simple environment\\ncould thus be just\
        \ as complex as a simpler organism in the same\\nenvironment. For example,\\\
        nif one organism is capable of\\nmetabolizing both lactose and glucose, while\
        \ second can\\nmetabolize only glucose, the first organism will only be designated\\\
        nas more complex when there is a possibility that lactose will be\\npresent\
        \ in the environment.\\n\\nAcademic Editor: Angus Buckling, Oxford University,\

        \ theory [9,10] has suggested that\\nphenotypic complexity is proportional\
        \ to the drift load, a quantity\\nthat describes how equilibrium mean population\
        \ fitness declines\\nwith population size. This can be intuitively understood\
        \ in the\\nfollowing manner. An organism’s fitness is a result of how\\nsuccessfully\
        \ it interacts with the environment. As the number of\\ninteractions (traits)\
        \ increases, it becomes difficult to simultaneously\\nmaintain each one. Very\
        \ large populations maintain nearly\\noptimal mean population fitness regardless\
        \ of phenotypic com-\\nplexity. Small populations can maintain high average\
        \ fitness only\\nwhen there are a small number of traits (low complexity)\
        \ each\\ncontributing a relatively large amount to fitness; if there are a\
        \ large\\nnumber of traits (high complexity), each contributing only a small\\\
        namount to fitness, then small populations will be incapable of\\nmaintaining\
        \ all of them. Thus for complex organisms, there will be\\na large difference\
        \ in mean fitness between small and large\\npopulations; for simple organisms,\
        \ this difference in average fitness\\nwill be small.\\n\\nfirst\\n\\nThe\
        \ phenotypic model used to link drift load to phenotypic\\ncomplexity was\\\
        nformalized by R. A. Fisher [11]. He\\nenvisioned a multidimensional phenotypic\
        \ space in which the\\norigin of each axis corresponded to the most-fit or\
        \ optimum\\nphenotypic value. As phenotypic values depart from the origin,\\\
        nfitness decreases. The manner in which fitness declines is described\\nby\
        \ a monotonically decreasing function, which may take a variety\\nof shapes,\
        \ e.g., linear, concave-up, or –down. Individuals of equal\\nfitness but different\
        \ phenotypic values trace out fitness isoclines in\\nthe space. If an organism\
        \ has only two phenotypes, the phenotypic\\nspace is two-dimensional and the\
        \ fitness isoclines are a series of\\ncircles centered on the origin of the\
        \ axes (Fig. 1). If an organism\\nhas n number of phenotypes, phenotypic space\
        \ is n-dimensional,\\nand each fitness\\nisocline is an n-dimensional hyper-sphere.\\\
        nBecause of the assumed geometry of the isoclines, this model is\\nreferred\
        \ to as Fisher’s Geometric Model (FGM) of phenotypic or\\nadaptive evolution.\\\
        n\\nA population of individuals can be represented as a collection of\\npoints\
        \ in FGM and the phenotypic values of each point allow\\nascertainment of\
        \ the fitness of each individual. Individual fitness\\nthen determines the\
        \ probability of each individual surviving and\\nreproducing the next generation.\
        \ Evolution is thus described in\\nFGM by following the collection of points\
        \ over many generations.\\nTo generate novel genetic variation, mutations\
        \ are drawn from an\\nassumed distribution that is centered on the phenotypic\
        \ position of\\neach individual (Fig. 1). By never descending into genotypic\
        \ space,\\nFGM is analogous to quantitative genetics models. Both types of\\\
        nmodels assume or require only that a component of phenotype is\\nheritable.\
        \ However, whereas quantitative genetic models represent\\npopulations by\
        \ their mean and variance, FGM is an individual-\\nbased model in which each\
        \ individual is evaluated according to its\\nfitness.\\n\\nFGM makes a set\
        \ of\\n\\ntheoretical predictions about how\\nadaptation tends\\nthese have\
        \ been\\nto occur, and many of\\ncorroborated by experimental results. The\
        \ greater frequency of\\nsmall-sized beneficial mutations [12], the L-shaped\
        \ distribution of\\nmutations fixed throughout evolution [13], the existence\
        \ of fitness\\nequilibriums [14], and the absence of intrinsically beneficial\
        \ or\\nintrinsically deleterious mutations have all been observed during\\\
        nlaboratory evolution, and all conform to the conditions set forth\\nthus\
        \ appears to offer a reasonable\\nunder FGM. The model\\nframework for the\
        \ study of microbial evolution.\\n\\nThe utility of FGM lies in the fact that\
        \ it does not require any\\nparticular assumptions about the map between phenotype\
        \ and\\ngenotype, and that the specific predictions about how fitness\\nchanges\
        \ during evolution appear to be robust. In the present\\n\\nPopulation Genetic\

        \ see the below for a more\\ndetailed discussion of why we term this the effective\
        \ number of\\ndimensions), and Ne is the effective population size. This confirms\\\
        nthe results obtained by Poon and Otto who approximated Feq(ne,\\nNe) as 2Ne/(2Ne+ne)\
        \ [10].\\n\\nAlthough earlier studies on FGM model have used such linear\\\
        nfitness functions (for the sake of mathematical simplicity), recent\\nexperimental\
        \ studies do not seem to support the use of such\\na function [17–19]. Linear\
        \ fitness functions give rise to dramatic\\nsynergistic epistasis. For example,\
        \ a mutation that increases the\\ndistance to the optimal phenotype by 0.1\
        \ units may decrease\\nfitness by 10% in the optimal genotype (which by definition\
        \ has\\na fitness of 1); an analogous mutation will decrease fitness by 50%\\\
        nin an organism with a fitness of 0.2; this mutation will become\\nin any\
        \ genotype with a fitness less than 0.1. Recent\\nlethal\\nexperimental work\
        \ suggests that epistasis between deleterious\\nmutations is either antagonistic\
        \ [17–19] or null [20]. We therefore\\ndecided to use a family of exponential\\\
        nfitness functions with\\na parameter that allows control over the level and\
        \ shape of\\nepistasis.\\n\\nExponential-type Fitness Decline\\nIn an effort\
        \ to explore fitness functions more compatible with\\nexperimental data, we\
        \ studied the following family of functions.\\nf(d) = exp(2(dQ)),\\nin which\
        \ fitness is an exponentially decaying\\nfunction of the distance to the optimum\
        \ to the power of Q. Q is\\na parameter that modifies the concavity of the\
        \ fitness decline. As\\norganisms move away from the optimum the effect of\

        \ in VSV suggests that the concavity of fitness function\\nis slightly upward\
        \ [19]. However, in further analyses we estimate\\nQ as 1 for both the phage\
        \ and the virus, as no clear departure from\\n1 has been observed in either\
        \ case.\\n\\nEstimates of Phenotypic Complexity for VSV and\\nwX174\\nWe applied\
        \ the maximum likelihood estimator to the experimental\\nestimates of population\
        \ fitness for wX174 and VSV, and using\\na likelihood ratio test we defined\
        \ 95% confidence intervals (CI),\\nwhich we list here in parentheses. For\
        \ wX174 we found ne/Q = 45\\n(42249), and fref = 1.245 (1.2321.26), whereas\
        \ for VSV we found\\nne/Q = 10 (8212) and fref = 1.98 (1.9422.05) (Fig. 3).\
        \ In both of\\nthese cases, fref is calculated per generation relative to\
        \ the ancestral\\nvirus for wX174 and relative to a reference strain for VSV.\
        \ As no\\nstrong signature of curvature in the fitness surface has been found\\\
        nfor either virus, we assume that Q is approximately one.\\n\\nDISCUSSION\\\
        nTo understand how biological complexity changes during the\\ncourse of evolution,\
        \ a metric is needed. Previously, measures such\\nas the number of genes,\
        \ cell types or metabolic processes have\\nthey often lead to incongruent\
        \ results.\\nbeen proposed, but\\nOrganisms with more cell types do not necessarily\
        \ have more\\ngenes. Here we suggest that a metric unifying biological systems\\\
        nhas not been appropriately identified. To circumvent this problem,\\nwe have\
        \ developed a metric of biological complexity termed\\nphenotypic complexity\
        \ (ne). We have quantified this metric in the\\nviruses wX174 and VSV by utilizing\
        \ a population genetic model\\nthat describes how phenotypic complexity affects\
        \ the drift load that\\na population experiences.\\n\\nPhenotypic complexity\
        \ (ne)\\n\\nis a measure of the number of\\nthat are acted upon by\\ngenetically\
        \ uncorrelated phenotypes\\nnatural selection. Because Darwinian evolution\
        \ through natural\\nselection is\\nthe fundamental element unifying all biological\\\
        norganisms, we propose that ne is potentially a more relevant\\nmetric than\
        \ those previously suggested.\\n\\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org\\n\\n4\\n\\\
        nFebruary 2007 |\\n\\nIssue 2 | e217\\n\\n\\fRobustness of the Model\\nUsing\
        \ recent theoretical results we have analytically quantified the\\ndependency\
        \ of the drift load (equilibrium fitness) on the effective\\npopulation size\
        \ and phenotypic complexity. The linear fitness\\nfunction that has been employed\
        \ previously to simplify the\\nmathematical analyses is no longer necessary.\
        \ Such a function\\nmakes strong assumptions about the form of the fitness\
        \ landscape;\\nspecifically, mutational effects become very large as fitness\
        \ is\\nreduced. Thus at low fitness most mutations are either lethal or of\\\
        nvery large effect, a scenario which is incompatible with what we\\nhave previously\
        \ observed [14].\\n\\nWe have therefore studied a more general family of fitness\\\
        nfunctions of the form f(d) = exp(2(dQ)), and found that Feq(Ne,\\nne) = (12(2?Ne21)21)(ne/Q).\
        \ It appears that this equation remains\\nvalid over a much wider range of\
        \ conditions than those used in the\\ncanonical FGM, in which mutations are\
        \ required to be isotropic\\nand fitness isoclines are symmetric about the\
        \ origin. An interesting\\nfeature of this formula is that it does not require\
        \ a model in which\\nmutations can affect all phenotypic traits simultaneously.\
        \ In the\\ninitial formulation of FGM, all phenotypic axes intersect at the\\\
        norigin of each axis. This original FGM can be modified slightly\\nsuch that\
        \ some phenotypes are grouped into separate phenotypic\\nmodules, and within\
        \ a module, all phenotypes again intersect at\\neach other’s origin. Any mutation\
        \ that occurs within a module can\\naffect only other phenotypes within that\
        \ module, and none that lie\\noutside of it (i.e. there is no pleiotropy between\
        \ modules, an idea\\nsimilar to previous conceptions of modularity [23]).\
        \ Using the\\nmore general description of the equilibrium drift load that\
        \ we have\\nderived above, a phenotypic landscape a composed of a single\\\
        nmodule with ne dimensions has the same drift load function as\\na landscape\
        \ composed of m independent modules of size ne,i with\\nSi ne,i = ne because\
        \ we have\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n1{ 2Ne{1\\nÞ\\n\\nð\\n\\nð\\n(cid:2) ne=Q\\n\\nÞ\\\

        n\\nrobust to many of the assumptions underlying FGM.\\n\\nOther Attempts\
        \ to Estimate Phenotypic Complexity\\nRecently, another theoretical study\
        \ developed a framework to\\nestimate phenotypic complexity [21]. The model\
        \ developed used\\npredictions on the distribution of mutational effects to\
        \ estimate\\ncomplexity. This analysis, which is completely independent from\\\
        nours, found an interesting correlation between gene number and\\ncomplexity\
        \ in a variety of organisms ranging from a virus to C.\\nelegans. However,\
        \ for all the organisms for which enough data\\nthe number of phenotypic\\\
        nexisted to perform the analysis,\\ndimensions estimated was very small; 0.21\
        \ phenotypic dimensions\\nfor E. coli, 1.07 in VSV, 1–2 for S. cerevisiae,\
        \ and 2–3 for D.\\nmelanogaster and C. elegans. We think that several effects\
        \ may limit\\nthe predictive quality such a method. Firstly, mutation accumu-\\\
        nlation methods and the inherent noise in fitness estimates are very\\ndifferent\
        \ across species and comparison across species are thus\\ndifficult. One illustration\
        \ of this is the large variability in fitness\\nestimates for mutations in\
        \ a single species using two methods: in\\nVSV earlier estimates (using Bateman-Mukai\
        \ estimates) predicted\\na 0.002 mean fitness effect per mutation, while more\
        \ recent and\\naccurate estimates (which introduced each mutation individually)\\\
        nbrought the estimate it to 14% (a 70-fold difference). Secondly,\\nneutral\
        \ mutations are not considered in the model developed by\\nMartin and Lenormand.\
        \ However, part of the mutation produced\\n\\nPopulation Genetic Complexity\\\

        \ genes useless in laboratory\\nconditions and will\\nin the\\ncalculation\
        \ of mean fitness effects of mutations even if they do\\nnot affect any phenotype\
        \ in the laboratory environment. Third,\\ncontrary to our model, if phenotypes\
        \ are organized in different\\nmodules (as many data suggest), their model\
        \ will provide different\\nestimates; in other words, their model requires\
        \ that all traits can be\\nsimultaneously affected by a single mutations.\
        \ All these considera-\\ntions suggest that a second independent model should\
        \ be used to\\nestimate phenotypic complexity.\\n\\nOne of the central FGM\
        \ hypotheses that we have so far not\\naddressed is the single-peaked nature\
        \ of the landscape. Although\\nFGM contains few assumptions about the nature\
        \ of the genotypic\\nlandscape, the model explicitly requires a phenotypic\
        \ landscape\\ncontaining a single peak; without this, then the fitness function,\\\
        nf(d), cannot be described by a decreasing function. However,\\nrecent experimental\
        \ evidence over large evolutionary time scales\\nstrongly suggests that while\
        \ the genotypic landscape may contain\\nmultiple peaks, the phenotypic landscape\
        \ is generally much less\\ncomplex. Several experimental studies using microbes\
        \ have shown\\nthat a considerable amount of phenotypic convergence occurs\\\
        nduring evolution [24–27], even when organisms begin from\\ndifferent starting\
        \ points in the landscape [28]. These phenomena\\nwould only be expected if\
        \ the phenotypic landscape exhibited\\na single-peak. However, the evidence\
        \ for ruggedness in the genetic\\nlandscape is also substantial, especially\
        \ in experiments that have\\nlooked at bacterial evolution of resistance to\
        \ antibiotics [29]. In\\nthis case, the fitness relationships between the\
        \ wild type genotypes,\\nresistant genotypes, compensated resistant genotypes,\
        \ and sensitive\\ngenotypes bearing the compensatory mutation exhibit high\
        \ levels\\nof epistasis, characteristic of a rugged genetic landscape. In\
        \ other\\nin which the cost of resistance was associated with\\nstudies\\\
        na phenotype [30],\\nfitness restoration to wild-type level was\\nsometimes\
        \ observed and, more importantly for our concern, it\\nthe phenotypic damage\\\
        nwas associated with a restoration of\\nthe resistance mutation\\nassociated\
        \ with the occurrence of\\n(transcription efficiency of\\nrifampicin resistant\
        \ mutants was\\nrestored back to the level observed in rifampicin sensitive\
        \ strain).\\nThis also suggests the singularity of the phenotypic optimum,\\\
        nalthough different genetic combinations may underlie this\\nis focusing neither\
        \ on the\\noptimum. However, as our model\\ngenetic nature of the adaptive\
        \ landscape, nor on the rate of\\nadaptation (ruggedness means that several\
        \ mutations could be\\nneeded to restore the effect of one) it should not\
        \ be too sensitive to\\nthe small level ruggedness of the genetic landscape\
        \ described so\\nfar.\\n\\nThe Concept of Phenotypic Complexity\\nAs discussed\
        \ previously, the quantity denoted by ne is the number\\nof genetically uncorrelated\
        \ phenotypes that are influenced by the\\naction of natural selection. The\
        \ dimensions enumerated by ne are\\nthus genetically orthogonal to each other,\
        \ and analogous to the\\naxes needed to describe the variation among multiple\
        \ phenotypes\\nmeasured on a collection of individuals and mutants in a principal\\\
        ncomponent analysis. However, the number of axes enumerated by\\nne is filtered\
        \ by natural selection, while in a PCA analysis the\\nnumber of axes is limited\
        \ only by the number of independent\\nphenotypes\\nthat are measured. Because\
        \ each phenotype is\\noptimized at a value determined by each organism’s ecological\\\
        nenvironment, there is a dependence of phenotypic complexity on\\nthe complexity\
        \ of\\nthe ecological niche experienced by each\\norganism; if natural selection\
        \ does not act on a phenotype, then\\nthat phenotype does not contribute to\
        \ the complexity metric.\\nFinally, although the estimates of ne arise from\
        \ an idealized model\\n\\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org\\n\\n5\\n\\nFebruary\
        \ 2007 |\\n\\nIssue 2 | e217\\n\\n\\fof phenotypic evolution; as Orr suggested\
        \ previously, estimates of\\nphenotypic complexity using FGM can be viewed\
        \ as ‘‘effective’’\\nestimates of phenotypic complexity [6]. This concept\
        \ is analogous\\nto the concept in population genetics of effective population\
        \ size,\\nNe, in which two populations with different numbers of individuals\\\
        nand different sex ratios might have the same effective population\\nsize\
        \ and therefore respond similarly to the different population\\ngenetic forces.\
        \ Thus two organisms, although they may differ in\\nboth the underlying genetic\
        \ mechanisms and in the complexity of\\nthe environment in which they live,\
        \ may have similar phenotypic\\ncomplexities. The utility of the concept lies\
        \ not in the implications\\nit makes about specific phenotypes or genetic\
        \ details, but in that it\\nenables a general quantification of how an organism\
        \ is affected by\\nnatural selection (the complexity with which natural selection\
        \ acts),\\nand furthermore, how this action affects\\nthe evolutionary\\ndynamics\
        \ of that organism [6].\\n\\nViral Estimates of Phenotypic Complexity\\nUnsurprisingly,\
        \ our estimates of phenotypic complexity are orders\\nof magnitude smaller\
        \ than either the number of nucleotides or\\neven the number of amino acids\
        \ encoded by the genomes of these\\norganisms (5386 bp and 11,161bp in wX174\
        \ and VSV, respec-\\ntively). This agrees with the concept of phenotypic complexity\
        \ that\\nwe have defined. Although mutations that occur at one nucleotide\\\
        nor amino acid do not affect\\nthey are\\ngenetically separable phenotypes),\
        \ it is clearly unlikely that each\\nnucleotide or amino acid is independently\
        \ acted up by natural\\nselection. Secondly, each estimate of complexity is\
        \ greater than the\\nnumber of genes encoded by each virus (11 and 5 for wX174\
        \ and\\nVSV, respectively). The presence of multiple functional domains\\\
        nwithin a single protein is consistent with an estimate of complexity\\nthat\
        \ is greater than the number of encoded proteins.\\n\\nthose at another (i.e.\\\
        n\\nAlthough we have only two estimates, we can briefly consider\\nthem from\
        \ a comparative standpoint: although the genome size of\\nwX174 is half of\
        \ VSV, our estimate of phenotypic complexity\\nquantifies wX174 as being approximately\
        \ four-fold more complex.\\nIt is notable, then, that wX174 contains approximately\
        \ twice the\\nnumber of genes as VSV. Additionally, the lifestyle of wX174\
        \ is\\narguably much more elaborate than that of VSV. wX174 interacts\\nwith\
        \ several host factors in order to perform transcription and\\nreplication;\
        \ 13 host factors are required for replication alone [31].\\nThis can be contrasted\
        \ with VSV, in which transcription and\\nreplication are similar processes,\
        \ both performed by the viral\\npolymerase. Few host\\nfactors (and thus few\
        \ interactions) are\\nnecessary at all during the entire life cycle of VSV\
        \ [32].\\n\\nThese estimates suggest that, for very simple organisms such\
        \ as\\nviruses, phenotypic complexity correlates well with the number of\\\
        ngenes in an organism, and more specifically, with the number of\\ninteractions\
        \ characteristic of that organism [2]. This observation\\nsupports the idea\
        \ that phenotypic complexity depends on the\\ninteractions between an organism\
        \ and its environment. Genome\\nsize in itself seems to be a poor correlate\
        \ of phenotypic complexity,\\na notable result in consideration of the very\
        \ small genome sizes of\\nthese organisms. Whether\\nsuch correlations or\
        \ absence of\\ncorrelation with gene number or genome length would hold for\\\
        nmore complex organisms remains an open question. Nevertheless,\\nby studying\
        \ very simple organisms, we have shown that the use of\\ndrift load could\
        \ be used to estimate complexity in a novel and\\nconsistent way. We now propose\
        \ that such a method could be\\nhelpful to identify and quantify the strongest\
        \ determinants of\\nbiological complexity of higher organisms.\\n\\nAlthough\
        \ the theory presented here appears to be quite robust,\\nit is too early\
        \ to conclude that it is an accurate reflection of the\\nunderlying biology.\
        \ To be studied in an FGM framework,\\n\\nPopulation Genetic Complexity\\\
        n\\nfor population size-dependent\\n\\norganisms need to present at least\
        \ one phenotypic property to\\nselection. Additionally, populations, even\
        \ those of very small size,\\nis explicitly\\nshould evolve towards a fitness\
        \ equilibrium that\\ndependent on population size. We found data in the literature\\\
        nconsistent with this expectation for one organism, VSV. We now\\nprovide\
        \ further support\\nfitness\\nequilibria by evolving populations of the bacteriophage\
        \ wX174.\\nTogether, these two data sets suggest that evolutionary analyses\\\
        nusing an FGM framework are a valid approach. Moreover, the use\\nof very\
        \ simple organisms such as viruses is useful for gaining insight\\ninto metrics\
        \ of complexity, as for such simple organisms, gene\\nnumber is likely to\
        \ be a very good correlate of organismal\\ncomplexity, and this should be\
        \ reflected by the metric. Although\\nour observations are currently limited\
        \ to two viral species, it is\\n(i.e. population size-\\nclear that\\nfrom\

        \ a quantitative level\\nthe\\nthat\\nnumber of phenotypic dimensions are\

        ndrift load and phenotypic complexity in a greater number of\\norganisms is\
        \ needed before further conclusions can be drawn.\\n\\nConclusions\\nHere\
        \ we have presented a top-down approach to quantifying\\nbiological complexity.\
        \ This can be contrasted with previously\\nproposed metrics of complexity,\
        \ which have relied on physically\\nmeasurable quantities of the organism\
        \ (bottom-up approaches).\\nTwo important conceptual differences separate\
        \ these two ap-\\nproaches. Most importantly, phenotypic complexity is dependent\\\
        non both the organism and the environmental context. An\\norganism is not\
        \ complex because it has many measurable\\nphenotypes; it is complex because\
        \ it has many phenotypes on\\nwhich natural selection acts. Secondly, phenotypic\
        \ complexity\\ndoes not rely on artificially constructed concepts such as\
        \ genes\\n[33]. As an example, if two genes are deemed to be of equal\\nsuch\
        \ a\\ncomplexity because they are functionally equivalent,\\nmeasure necessarily\
        \ ignores the subtle ways in which each may\\nbe regulated, or spliced, or\
        \ expressed within the cell. Quantify-\\ning such multiple layers of complexity\
        \ is difficult if the metric\\nrelies on physically measurable quantities.\\\
        n\\nHowever, phenotypic complexity remains an inherently abstract\\nmetric.\
        \ It cannot aid in identifying the specific characteristics\\ncontributing\
        \ to the complexity of an organism. Instead, it addresses\\nthe complexity\
        \ with which natural selection views an organism, and\\nthe complexity with\
        \ which an organism is capable of generating\\nnovel phenotypic variation.\
        \ For this reason, testing how phenotypic\\ncomplexity compares to more traditional\
        \ metrics of complexity (for\\nexample, the numbers of genes, protein interactions,\
        \ or cellular\\npathways) may provide significant insight into biological\
        \ systems.\\nFinally, phenotypic complexity (and the resulting equilibrium\
        \ drift\\nload) affords a unique opportunity to contrast the action of natural\\\
        nselection between different organisms or different environments in\\na very\
        \ general and unconstrained manner.\\n\\nMETHODS\\nViral Evolution\\nThe details\

  expected_output: However, phenotypic complexity remains an inherently abstract metric.
    It cannot aid in identifying the specific characteristics contributing to the
    complexity of an organism. Instead, it addresses the complexity with which natural
    selection views an organism, and the complexity with which an organism is capable
    of generating novel phenotypic variation. For this reason, testing how phenotypic
    complexity compares to more traditional metrics of complexity (for example, the
    numbers of genes, protein interactions, or cellular pathways) may provide significant
    insight into biological systems. Finally, phenotypic complexity (and the resulting
    equilibrium drift load) affords a unique opportunity to contrast the action of
    natural selection between different organisms or different environments in a very
    general and unconstrained manner.

              \ Population Genetic Approach\\n\\n**Authors:** Olivier Tenaillon, Olin\
              \ K. Silander, Jean-Philippe Uzan, Lin Chao\\n\\n## Abstract\\n\\n##\
              \ Background\\nVarious definitions of biological complexity have been\
              \ proposed: the number of genes, cell types, or metabolic processes\
              \ within an organism. As knowledge of biological systems has increased,\
              \ it has become apparent that these metrics are often incongruent.\\\
              n## Methodology\\nHere we propose an alternative complexity metric based\
              \ on the number of genetically uncorrelated phenotypic traits contributing\
              \ to an organism's fitness. This metric, phenotypic complexity, is more\
              \ objective than previous suggestions, as complexity is measured from\
              \ a fundamental biological perspective, that of natural selection. We\
              \ utilize a model linking the equilibrium fitness (drift load) of a\
              \ population to phenotypic complexity. We then use results from viral\
              \ evolution experiments to compare the phenotypic complexities of two\
              \ viruses, the bacteriophage X174 and vesicular stomatitis virus, and\
              \ to illustrate the consistency of our approach and its applicability.\\\
              n## Conclusions/Significance\\nBecause Darwinian evolution through natural\
              \ selection is the fundamental element unifying all biological organisms,\
              \ we propose that our metric of complexity is potentially a more relevant\
              \ metric than others, based on the count of artificially defined set\
              \ of objects.\\n\\n## Introduction\\n\\nA persistent question in biology\
              \ is how organismal complexity changes through the course of evolution\
              \ [1]–[5]. Although significant progress has been made in the understanding\
              \ and quantifying organismal characteristics at many level of organization\
              \ (DNA, proteins, metabolic networks, cellular organization, organ functions,\
              \ individual behavior) much confusion remains about how to accurately\
              \ quantify organismal complexity. Several intuitive proposals have been\
              \ made that take into account simple metrics such as the number of genes\
              \ or cell types. However, these simple measures quickly lead to conflicting\
              \ conclusions [2], [3]. Here we propose a fundamentally different approach\
              \ to measuring organismal complexity; as opposed to relying on bottom-up\
              \ measures such as the number of genes an organism has, we utilize an\
              \ objective biological approach: natural selection. Instead of asking\
              \ how complex an organism is from our own perspective, we ask: how complex\
              \ is an organism from the perspective of natural selection? Essentially,\
              \ this is a top-down metric of organismal complexity that we term phenotypic\
              \ complexity.\\n\\nPhenotypic complexity quantifies the number of genetically\
              \ uncorrelated phenotypic traits contributing to an organism's fitness.\
              \ A phenotypic trait contributes to an organism's fitness only to the\
              \ extent that natural selection acts upon that trait. Thus an organismal\
              \ phenotype that is no longer under selection (for example during an\
              \ evolutionary transition from a generalist to specialist lifestyle),\
              \ although expressed by the organism, contributes nothing to organismal\
              \ complexity. Secondly, if two phenotypes contribute to complexity,\
              \ they must be genetically separable: some mutations must exist that\
              \ affect one phenotype but not the other. If no such mutations exist,\
              \ then although we may perceive two phenotypes under selection, these\
              \ phenotypes contribute only a single trait toward determining phenotypic\
              \ complexity. As an example consider the affinity of an enzyme for a\
              \ substrate, and the rate at which that substrate is converted to product.\
              \ If there are no mutations that affect one of these traits but not\
              \ the other, then these two phenotypes are considered one, until the\
              \ organism gains the genetic complexity to generate variation in one\
              \ phenotype without affecting the second, for example by evolving functionally\
              \ separate domains in the enzyme. Phenotypic complexity is thus a combined\
              \ description of how natural selection perceives organismal phenotypes\
              \ and how phenotypic variation is generated by the organism. This concept\
              \ was first articulated by Orr, and followed later by others [6]–[8].\
              \ Notably, it is similar to physical complexity, which is a measure\
              \ of the amount of information that an organism encodes about its environment\
              \ [4], [5].\\n\\nAn important aspect of measuring complexity in this\
              \ manner is that both the organism and the environment affect the metric.\
              \ An organism with many phenotypes, but living in simple environment\
              \ could thus be just as complex as a simpler organism in the same environment.\
              \ For example, if one organism is capable of metabolizing both lactose\
              \ and glucose, while second can metabolize only glucose, the first organism\
              \ will only be designated as more complex when there is a possibility\
              \ that lactose will be present in the environment.\\n\\nRecent population\
              \ genetic theory [9], [10] has suggested that phenotypic complexity\
              \ is proportional to the drift load, a quantity that describes how equilibrium\
              \ mean population fitness declines with population size. This can be\
              \ intuitively understood in the following manner. An organism's fitness\
              \ is a result of how successfully it interacts with the environment.\
              \ As the number of interactions (traits) increases, it becomes difficult\
              \ to simultaneously maintain each one. Very large populations maintain\
              \ nearly optimal mean population fitness regardless of phenotypic complexity.\
              \ Small populations can maintain high average fitness only when there\
              \ are a small number of traits (low complexity) each contributing a\
              \ relatively large amount to fitness; if there are a large number of\
              \ traits (high complexity), each contributing only a small amount to\
              \ fitness, then small populations will be incapable of maintaining all\
              \ of them. Thus for complex organisms, there will be a large difference\
              \ in mean fitness between small and large populations; for simple organisms,\
              \ this difference in average fitness will be small.\\n\\nThe phenotypic\
              \ model used to link drift load to phenotypic complexity was first formalized\
              \ by R. A. Fisher [11]. He envisioned a multidimensional phenotypic\
              \ space in which the origin of each axis corresponded to the most-fit\
              \ or optimum phenotypic value. As phenotypic values depart from the\
              \ origin, fitness decreases. The manner in which fitness declines is\
              \ described by a monotonically decreasing function, which may take a\
              \ variety of shapes, e.g., linear, concave-up, or –down. Individuals\
              \ of equal fitness but different phenotypic values trace out fitness\
              \ isoclines in the space. If an organism has only two phenotypes, the\
              \ phenotypic space is two-dimensional and the fitness isoclines are\
              \ a series of circles centered on the origin of the axes (Fig. 1). If\
              \ an organism has n number of phenotypes, phenotypic space is n-dimensional,\
              \ and each fitness isocline is an n-dimensional hyper-sphere. Because\
              \ of the assumed geometry of the isoclines, this model is referred to\
              \ as Fisher's Geometric Model (FGM) of phenotypic or adaptive evolution.\\\
              n\\n![Figure: Fisher's geometric model in two-dimensional phenotypic\
              \ space.Fitness varies along two phenotypic axes, with the maximum fitness\
              \ located, for convenience, at the origin of these axes. Any individual\
              \ in a population (black point) can thus be described by its phenotypic\
              \ values, which determine the fitness of that organism. At any specific\
              \ fitness, there are a number of other phenotypic combinations that\
              \ have equivalent fitness; the values of these phenotypic combinations\
              \ establish the fitness isoclines (black circle). From the optimum,\
              \ fitness declines monotonically according to the structure of the landscape\
              \ (see text). Each mutation (arrow) is drawn from a distribution centered\
              \ on the phenotypic position of each individual, resulting in offspring\
              \ with new phenotypic combinations and fitness values (white point).](figure_description)\\\
              n\\nA population of individuals can be represented as a collection of\
              \ points in FGM and the phenotypic values of each point allow ascertainment\
              \ of the fitness of each individual. Individual fitness then determines\
              \ the probability of each individual surviving and reproducing the next\
              \ generation. Evolution is thus described in FGM by following the collection\
              \ of points over many generations. To generate novel genetic variation,\
              \ mutations are drawn from an assumed distribution that is centered\
              \ on the phenotypic position of each individual (Fig. 1). By never descending\
              \ into genotypic space, FGM is analogous to quantitative genetics models.\
              \ Both types of models assume or require only that a component of phenotype\
              \ is heritable. However, whereas quantitative genetic models represent\
              \ populations by their mean and variance, FGM is an individual-based\
              \ model in which each individual is evaluated according to its fitness.\\\
              n\\nFGM makes a set of theoretical predictions about how adaptation\
              \ tends to occur, and many of these have been corroborated by experimental\
              \ results. The greater frequency of small-sized beneficial mutations\
              \ [12], the L-shaped distribution of mutations fixed throughout evolution\
              \ [13], the existence of fitness equilibriums [14], and the absence\
              \ of intrinsically beneficial or intrinsically deleterious mutations\
              \ have all been observed during laboratory evolution, and all conform\
              \ to the conditions set forth under FGM. The model thus appears to offer\
              \ a reasonable framework for the study of microbial evolution.\\n\\\
              nThe utility of FGM lies in the fact that it does not require any particular\
              \ assumptions about the map between phenotype and genotype, and that\
              \ the specific predictions about how fitness changes during evolution\
              \ appear to be robust. In the present paper, we further refine previous\
              \ predictions derived from FGM [9], [10] to take into account some fitness\
              \ functions compatible with experimental data and use these results\
              \ to estimate the phenotypic complexity of two viruses evolved in the\
              \ laboratory.\\n\\n## Model and Results\\n\\nThe link between drift\
              \ load and phenotypic complexity under FGM was first investigated by\
              \ Hartl and Taubes [9] (although Wagner and Gabriel [15] had worked\
              \ previously on a similar question), and was later refined by Poon and\
              \ Otto [10]. Recent theoretical techniques from statistical physics\
              \ now allow an exact solution of FGM for several fitness functions.\
              \ Sella and Hirsh [16] found that mean equilibrium fitness 〈f〉 can be\
              \ written as\\n\\nIn which ν = 2⋅Ne−1 in the diploid case and 2⋅Ne−2\
              \ in the haploid, and ρ(f), the density function, i.e. the size of fitness\
              \ f isocline, is dependent on the number of dimensions and of the fitness\
              \ function used.\\n\\n### Linear Fitness Decline\\n\\nIf fitness is\
              \ assumed to be a linearly decreasing function of the phenotypic distance\
              \ to the optimum, then we find that the average fitness is given by\
              \ (Methods, Appendix A):in the diploid case, in which Feq is the equilibrium\
              \ fitness (drift load) expressed as a fraction of the maximum attainable\
              \ fitness of the organism, ne is the effective number of dimensions\
              \ of the phenotypic space (phenotypic complexity; see the below for\
              \ a more detailed discussion of why we term this the effective number\
              \ of dimensions), and Ne is the effective population size. This confirms\
              \ the results obtained by Poon and Otto who approximated Feq(ne, Ne)\
              \ as 2Ne/(2Ne+ne) [10].\\n\\nAlthough earlier studies on FGM model have\
              \ used such linear fitness functions (for the sake of mathematical simplicity),\
              \ recent experimental studies do not seem to support the use of such\
              \ a function [17]–[19]. Linear fitness functions give rise to dramatic\
              \ synergistic epistasis. For example, a mutation that increases the\
              \ distance to the optimal phenotype by 0.1 units may decrease fitness\
              \ by 10% in the optimal genotype (which by definition has a fitness\
              \ of 1); an analogous mutation will decrease fitness by 50% in an organism\
              \ with a fitness of 0.2; this mutation will become lethal in any genotype\
              \ with a fitness less than 0.1. Recent experimental work suggests that\
              \ epistasis between deleterious mutations is either antagonistic [17]–[19]\
              \ or null [20]. We therefore decided to use a family of exponential\
              \ fitness functions with a parameter that allows control over the level\
              \ and shape of epistasis.\\n\\n### Exponential-type Fitness Decline\\\
              n\\nIn an effort to explore fitness functions more compatible with experimental\
              \ data, we studied the following family of functions. f(d) = exp(−(dQ)),\
              \ in which fitness is an exponentially decaying function of the distance\
              \ to the optimum to the power of Q. Q is a parameter that modifies the\
              \ concavity of the fitness decline. As organisms move away from the\
              \ optimum the effect of the mutation tend to have bigger effect if Q>1\
              \ and smaller effect if Q<1. In such a case the fitness equilibriums\
              \ are (Methods, Appendix A).\\n\\nThus in the haploid case on which\
              \ we will focus later:\\n\\nThe validity of these results was confirmed\
              \ by an individual based model of simulation analogous to one used previously\
              \ [6] (Fig. 2).\\n\\n![Figure: Predicted equilibrium fitness as a function\

              \ model; curves indicate the analytical results.](figure_description)\\\
              n\\n### Robustness of Fitness Equilibrium to FGM Hypothesis\\n\\nThe\
              \ implementation of FGM requires several assumptions in regards to the\
              \ biology of the organism. The distributions of the mutations and the\
              \ shape of the fitness function are required, and the geometry of the\
              \ fitness isoclines needs to be symmetrical. However, we show below\
              \ that the equilibrium drift load is fairly insensitive to these strict\
              \ assumptions.\\n\\nFirst, as equation (4) suggests, the fitness equilibrium\
              \ is independent of the mutational properties. As long as mutation is\
              \ assumed to be isotropic, only the convergence time to equilibrium,\
              \ and not the equilibrium fitness value, is affected by the distribution\
              \ of mutational effects (data not shown). Second, although the results\
              \ depend on the shape of the fitness function (linear or exponential-type),\
              \ they are independent of the slope: equilibrium values will be the\
              \ same if f(d) = exp(−αdQ) (Methods, Appendix B). Third, although the\
              \ canonical FGM assumes circular fitness isoclines, it can be shown\
              \ that if fitness isoclines are elliptical instead of circular, then\
              \ the density function is affected, but this cancels out in the calculation\
              \ of fitness equilibrium. This holds for fitness isoclines and also\
              \ for any fitness function of the form f(X) = exp(−∑αixi Q), where X\
              \ = (x0, x1, …, xn) is the coordinate of an individual in FGM, and αi\
              \ are positive parameters (Methods, Appendix B). Finally, if the mutation\
              \ cloud is a Gaussian ellipsoid, it has been shown that an appropriate\
              \ change of axes result in a space in which fitness isoclines are ellipsoid\
              \ while the mutation cloud is circular [21]. Hence it seems that asymmetry\
              \ in both the mutational distribution and the fitness isoclines do not\
              \ affect the equilibrium fitness values, a robustness of the equilibrium\
              \ fitness confirmed by some simulation data (data not shown).\\n\\nThe\
              \ equilibrium drift load seems to be a robust property of FGM that is\
              \ determined by the number of dimensions of phenotypic space, the population\
              \ size and the fitness function (especially its curvature). An accurate\
              \ estimate of phenotypic complexity can thus be obtained if it is possible\
              \ to estimate equilibrium fitness values (drift load) for several population\
              \ sizes, as well as the amount of curvature in the fitness function.\\\
              n\\n### Viral Evolution\\n\\nWe used two sets of evolution experiments\
              \ in which both fitness equilibrium values and fitness curvature have\
              \ been investigated (Fig. 3). In the first set of experiments we evolved\
              \ the bacteriophage ΦX174 on a bacterial lawn of its host, Escherichia\
              \ coli C. We increased the mutation rate of the phage to hasten convergence\
              \ to fitness equilibrium with the use of hydroxylamine; this resulted\
              \ in a mean mutation rate of 0.1 per genome per generation through the\
              \ 450 generations of evolution. Population size-dependent fitness equilibriums\
              \ were observed, confirming that evolution occurred in a manner compatible\
              \ with the assumptions of FGM. From these populations we obtained 21\
              \ measures of equilibrium fitness at five different population sizes.\
              \ Every transfer corresponded roughly to five phage generations and\
              \ effective population size was then approximated to five times the\
              \ number of plaques transferred (the harmonic mean).\\n\\n![Figure:\
              \ Equilibrium drift load as a function of population size for vesicular\
              \ stomatitis virus and ΦX174.Each point indicates the mean fitness of\
              \ a population. The VSV populations are shown in dark grey and the ΦX174\
              \ are shown in white. Some points have been displaced on the x-axis\
              \ for clarity. The VSV populations were transferred at effective population\
              \ sizes of four, ten, and 60; the ΦX174 populations were transferred\
              \ at effective population sizes of 15, 50, 150, 500, and 1250. The dotted\
              \ lines specify the maximum likelihood estimate of the fref value (the\
              \ maximum attainable fitness); the dark dotted line indicates the value\
              \ for VSV and the lighter dashed line indicates the value for ΦX174.](figure_description)\\\
              n\\nTo estimate the curvature of the fitness function we performed a\
              \ mutation accumulation analysis for high and low fitness clones and\
              \ showed that the distribution of deleterious mutations was similar\
              \ at both ends of the fitness range spanning a 300-fold difference.\
              \ This suggests that there is very little curvature of the fitness function.\\\
              n\\nWe used a second set of data from the literature, in which populations\
              \ were evolved for 20 transfers at different effective sizes. Novella\
              \ et al. [22] evolved four clones of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)\
              \ using plaque-to-plaque transfers of sizes two, five, and 30. They\
              \ also observed a population size-dependant fitness convergence. Although\
              \ the time for convergence was relatively short (40 viral generations),\
              \ several populations experienced no significant increases or decreases\
              \ in fitness over all replicates at a given population size, suggesting\
              \ that those population were at or near an equilibrium fitness value.\
              \ We used the fitness estimates from 24 populations evolved at population\
              \ sizes of two, five and 30. Every transfer corresponded to roughly\
              \ two viral generations and effective population size was thus approximated\
              \ as two times the number of viral plaques transferred.\\n\\nAdditionally,\
              \ an impressive set of data using site directed mutagenesis in VSV suggests\
              \ that the concavity of fitness function is slightly upward [19]. However,\
              \ in further analyses we estimate Q as 1 for both the phage and the\
              \ virus, as no clear departure from 1 has been observed in either case.\\\
              n\\n### Maximum Likelihood Estimate of Phenotypic Complexity\\n\\nWe\
              \ wish to use the previous mathematical results to estimate phenotypic\
              \ complexity from experimental data. However, there are two unknown\
              \ parameters in the experimental system that affect the equilibrium\
              \ drift load in a population: phenotypic complexity and the maximum\
              \ attainable fitness that can be reached by the viruses in the laboratory\
              \ environment (this parameter has been scaled to one in the previous\
              \ derivations). Using methods from statistical physics, we can find\
              \ the distribution of population fitness at equilibrium (shown above),\
              \ and thus derive a likelihood model that gives the probability of the\
              \ observed data for each couplet (ne/Q, fref), in which ne is the phenotypic\
              \ complexity, Q a parameter of the curvature of the fitness surface,\
              \ and fref the maximum attainable fitness. We also take into account\
              \ the noise in our experimental assessment of fitness values; especially\
              \ for high fitness populations, noise in the estimates of fitness can\
              \ alter the estimation of fref, as this parameter is by definition higher\
              \ than all fitness measures. Thus rather than using the probability\
              \ of the point estimate of fitness, we integrated the probability between\
              \ plus (f+) and minus (f−) one standard deviation of the point estimate.\
              \ In Appendix C we show that\\n\\n### Estimates of Phenotypic Complexity\
              \ for VSV and ΦX174\\n\\nWe applied the maximum likelihood estimator\
              \ to the experimental estimates of population fitness for ΦX174 and\
              \ VSV, and using a likelihood ratio test we defined 95% confidence intervals\
              \ (CI), which we list here in parentheses. For ΦX174 we found ne/Q =\
              \ 45 (42−49), and fref = 1.245 (1.23−1.26), whereas for VSV we found\
              \ ne/Q = 10 (8−12) and fref = 1.98 (1.94−2.05) (Fig. 3). In both of\
              \ these cases, fref is calculated per generation relative to the ancestral\
              \ virus for ΦX174 and relative to a reference strain for VSV. As no\
              \ strong signature of curvature in the fitness surface has been found\
              \ for either virus, we assume that Q is approximately one.\\n\\n## Linear\
              \ Fitness Decline\\n\\nIf fitness is assumed to be a linearly decreasing\
              \ function of the phenotypic distance to the optimum, then we find that\
              \ the average fitness is given by (Methods, Appendix A):in the diploid\
              \ case, in which Feq is the equilibrium fitness (drift load) expressed\
              \ as a fraction of the maximum attainable fitness of the organism, ne\
              \ is the effective number of dimensions of the phenotypic space (phenotypic\
              \ complexity; see the below for a more detailed discussion of why we\
              \ term this the effective number of dimensions), and Ne is the effective\
              \ population size. This confirms the results obtained by Poon and Otto\
              \ who approximated Feq(ne, Ne) as 2Ne/(2Ne+ne) [10].\\n\\nAlthough earlier\
              \ studies on FGM model have used such linear fitness functions (for\
              \ the sake of mathematical simplicity), recent experimental studies\
              \ do not seem to support the use of such a function [17]–[19]. Linear\
              \ fitness functions give rise to dramatic synergistic epistasis. For\
              \ example, a mutation that increases the distance to the optimal phenotype\
              \ by 0.1 units may decrease fitness by 10% in the optimal genotype (which\
              \ by definition has a fitness of 1); an analogous mutation will decrease\
              \ fitness by 50% in an organism with a fitness of 0.2; this mutation\
              \ will become lethal in any genotype with a fitness less than 0.1. Recent\
              \ experimental work suggests that epistasis between deleterious mutations\
              \ is either antagonistic [17]–[19] or null [20]. We therefore decided\
              \ to use a family of exponential fitness functions with a parameter\
              \ that allows control over the level and shape of epistasis.\\n\\n##\
              \ Exponential-type Fitness Decline\\n\\nIn an effort to explore fitness\
              \ functions more compatible with experimental data, we studied the following\
              \ family of functions. f(d) = exp(−(dQ)), in which fitness is an exponentially\
              \ decaying function of the distance to the optimum to the power of Q.\
              \ Q is a parameter that modifies the concavity of the fitness decline.\
              \ As organisms move away from the optimum the effect of the mutation\
              \ tend to have bigger effect if Q>1 and smaller effect if Q<1. In such\
              \ a case the fitness equilibriums are (Methods, Appendix A).\\n\\nThus\
              \ in the haploid case on which we will focus later:\\n\\nThe validity\
              \ of these results was confirmed by an individual based model of simulation\
              \ analogous to one used previously [6] (Fig. 2).\\n\\n![Figure: Predicted\

              \ fitness reached in the simulation model; curves indicate the analytical\
              \ results.](figure_description)\\n\\n## Robustness of Fitness Equilibrium\
              \ to FGM Hypothesis\\n\\nThe implementation of FGM requires several\
              \ assumptions in regards to the biology of the organism. The distributions\
              \ of the mutations and the shape of the fitness function are required,\
              \ and the geometry of the fitness isoclines needs to be symmetrical.\
              \ However, we show below that the equilibrium drift load is fairly insensitive\
              \ to these strict assumptions.\\n\\nFirst, as equation (4) suggests,\
              \ the fitness equilibrium is independent of the mutational properties.\
              \ As long as mutation is assumed to be isotropic, only the convergence\
              \ time to equilibrium, and not the equilibrium fitness value, is affected\
              \ by the distribution of mutational effects (data not shown). Second,\
              \ although the results depend on the shape of the fitness function (linear\
              \ or exponential-type), they are independent of the slope: equilibrium\
              \ values will be the same if f(d) = exp(−αdQ) (Methods, Appendix B).\
              \ Third, although the canonical FGM assumes circular fitness isoclines,\
              \ it can be shown that if fitness isoclines are elliptical instead of\
              \ circular, then the density function is affected, but this cancels\
              \ out in the calculation of fitness equilibrium. This holds for fitness\
              \ isoclines and also for any fitness function of the form f(X) = exp(−∑αixi\
              \ Q), where X = (x0, x1, …, xn) is the coordinate of an individual in\
              \ FGM, and αi are positive parameters (Methods, Appendix B). Finally,\
              \ if the mutation cloud is a Gaussian ellipsoid, it has been shown that\
              \ an appropriate change of axes result in a space in which fitness isoclines\
              \ are ellipsoid while the mutation cloud is circular [21]. Hence it\
              \ seems that asymmetry in both the mutational distribution and the fitness\
              \ isoclines do not affect the equilibrium fitness values, a robustness\
              \ of the equilibrium fitness confirmed by some simulation data (data\
              \ not shown).\\n\\nThe equilibrium drift load seems to be a robust property\
              \ of FGM that is determined by the number of dimensions of phenotypic\
              \ space, the population size and the fitness function (especially its\
              \ curvature). An accurate estimate of phenotypic complexity can thus\
              \ be obtained if it is possible to estimate equilibrium fitness values\
              \ (drift load) for several population sizes, as well as the amount of\
              \ curvature in the fitness function.\\n\\n## Viral Evolution\\n\\nWe\
              \ used two sets of evolution experiments in which both fitness equilibrium\
              \ values and fitness curvature have been investigated (Fig. 3). In the\
              \ first set of experiments we evolved the bacteriophage ΦX174 on a bacterial\
              \ lawn of its host, Escherichia coli C. We increased the mutation rate\
              \ of the phage to hasten convergence to fitness equilibrium with the\
              \ use of hydroxylamine; this resulted in a mean mutation rate of 0.1\
              \ per genome per generation through the 450 generations of evolution.\
              \ Population size-dependent fitness equilibriums were observed, confirming\
              \ that evolution occurred in a manner compatible with the assumptions\
              \ of FGM. From these populations we obtained 21 measures of equilibrium\
              \ fitness at five different population sizes. Every transfer corresponded\
              \ roughly to five phage generations and effective population size was\
              \ then approximated to five times the number of plaques transferred\
              \ (the harmonic mean).\\n\\n![Figure: Equilibrium drift load as a function\
              \ of population size for vesicular stomatitis virus and ΦX174.Each point\
              \ indicates the mean fitness of a population. The VSV populations are\
              \ shown in dark grey and the ΦX174 are shown in white. Some points have\
              \ been displaced on the x-axis for clarity. The VSV populations were\
              \ transferred at effective population sizes of four, ten, and 60; the\
              \ ΦX174 populations were transferred at effective population sizes of\
              \ 15, 50, 150, 500, and 1250. The dotted lines specify the maximum likelihood\
              \ estimate of the fref value (the maximum attainable fitness); the dark\
              \ dotted line indicates the value for VSV and the lighter dashed line\
              \ indicates the value for ΦX174.](figure_description)\\n\\nTo estimate\
              \ the curvature of the fitness function we performed a mutation accumulation\
              \ analysis for high and low fitness clones and showed that the distribution\
              \ of deleterious mutations was similar at both ends of the fitness range\
              \ spanning a 300-fold difference. This suggests that there is very little\
              \ curvature of the fitness function.\\n\\nWe used a second set of data\
              \ from the literature, in which populations were evolved for 20 transfers\
              \ at different effective sizes. Novella et al. [22] evolved four clones\
              \ of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) using plaque-to-plaque transfers\
              \ of sizes two, five, and 30. They also observed a population size-dependant\
              \ fitness convergence. Although the time for convergence was relatively\
              \ short (40 viral generations), several populations experienced no significant\
              \ increases or decreases in fitness over all replicates at a given population\
              \ size, suggesting that those population were at or near an equilibrium\
              \ fitness value. We used the fitness estimates from 24 populations evolved\
              \ at population sizes of two, five and 30. Every transfer corresponded\
              \ to roughly two viral generations and effective population size was\
              \ thus approximated as two times the number of viral plaques transferred.\\\
              n\\nAdditionally, an impressive set of data using site directed mutagenesis\
              \ in VSV suggests that the concavity of fitness function is slightly\
              \ upward [19]. However, in further analyses we estimate Q as 1 for both\
              \ the phage and the virus, as no clear departure from 1 has been observed\
              \ in either case.\\n\\n## Maximum Likelihood Estimate of Phenotypic\
              \ Complexity\\n\\nWe wish to use the previous mathematical results to\
              \ estimate phenotypic complexity from experimental data. However, there\
              \ are two unknown parameters in the experimental system that affect\
              \ the equilibrium drift load in a population: phenotypic complexity\
              \ and the maximum attainable fitness that can be reached by the viruses\
              \ in the laboratory environment (this parameter has been scaled to one\
              \ in the previous derivations). Using methods from statistical physics,\
              \ we can find the distribution of population fitness at equilibrium\
              \ (shown above), and thus derive a likelihood model that gives the probability\
              \ of the observed data for each couplet (ne/Q, fref), in which ne is\
              \ the phenotypic complexity, Q a parameter of the curvature of the fitness\
              \ surface, and fref the maximum attainable fitness. We also take into\
              \ account the noise in our experimental assessment of fitness values;\
              \ especially for high fitness populations, noise in the estimates of\
              \ fitness can alter the estimation of fref, as this parameter is by\
              \ definition higher than all fitness measures. Thus rather than using\
              \ the probability of the point estimate of fitness, we integrated the\
              \ probability between plus (f+) and minus (f−) one standard deviation\
              \ of the point estimate. In Appendix C we show that\\n\\n## Estimates\
              \ of Phenotypic Complexity for VSV and ΦX174\\n\\nWe applied the maximum\
              \ likelihood estimator to the experimental estimates of population fitness\
              \ for ΦX174 and VSV, and using a likelihood ratio test we defined 95%\
              \ confidence intervals (CI), which we list here in parentheses. For\
              \ ΦX174 we found ne/Q = 45 (42−49), and fref = 1.245 (1.23−1.26), whereas\
              \ for VSV we found ne/Q = 10 (8−12) and fref = 1.98 (1.94−2.05) (Fig.\
              \ 3). In both of these cases, fref is calculated per generation relative\
              \ to the ancestral virus for ΦX174 and relative to a reference strain\
              \ for VSV. As no strong signature of curvature in the fitness surface\
              \ has been found for either virus, we assume that Q is approximately\
              \ one.\\n\\n## Discussion\\n\\nTo understand how biological complexity\
              \ changes during the course of evolution, a metric is needed. Previously,\
              \ measures such as the number of genes, cell types or metabolic processes\
              \ have been proposed, but they often lead to incongruent results. Organisms\
              \ with more cell types do not necessarily have more genes. Here we suggest\
              \ that a metric unifying biological systems has not been appropriately\
              \ identified. To circumvent this problem, we have developed a metric\
              \ of biological complexity termed phenotypic complexity (ne). We have\
              \ quantified this metric in the viruses ΦX174 and VSV by utilizing a\
              \ population genetic model that describes how phenotypic complexity\
              \ affects the drift load that a population experiences.\\n\\nPhenotypic\
              \ complexity (ne) is a measure of the number of genetically uncorrelated\
              \ phenotypes that are acted upon by natural selection. Because Darwinian\
              \ evolution through natural selection is the fundamental element unifying\
              \ all biological organisms, we propose that ne is potentially a more\
              \ relevant metric than those previously suggested.\\n\\n### Robustness\
              \ of the Model\\n\\nUsing recent theoretical results we have analytically\
              \ quantified the dependency of the drift load (equilibrium fitness)\
              \ on the effective population size and phenotypic complexity. The linear\
              \ fitness function that has been employed previously to simplify the\
              \ mathematical analyses is no longer necessary. Such a function makes\
              \ strong assumptions about the form of the fitness landscape; specifically,\
              \ mutational effects become very large as fitness is reduced. Thus at\
              \ low fitness most mutations are either lethal or of very large effect,\
              \ a scenario which is incompatible with what we have previously observed\
              \ [14].\\n\\nWe have therefore studied a more general family of fitness\
              \ functions of the form f(d) = exp(−(dQ)), and found that Feq(Ne, ne)\
              \ = (1−(2⋅Ne−1)−1)(ne/Q). It appears that this equation remains valid\
              \ over a much wider range of conditions than those used in the canonical\
              \ FGM, in which mutations are required to be isotropic and fitness isoclines\
              \ are symmetric about the origin. An interesting feature of this formula\
              \ is that it does not require a model in which mutations can affect\
              \ all phenotypic traits simultaneously. In the initial formulation of\
              \ FGM, all phenotypic axes intersect at the origin of each axis. This\
              \ original FGM can be modified slightly such that some phenotypes are\
              \ grouped into separate phenotypic modules, and within a module, all\
              \ phenotypes again intersect at each other's origin. Any mutation that\
              \ occurs within a module can affect only other phenotypes within that\
              \ module, and none that lie outside of it (i.e. there is no pleiotropy\
              \ between modules, an idea similar to previous conceptions of modularity\
              \ [23]). Using the more general description of the equilibrium drift\
              \ load that we have derived above, a phenotypic landscape a composed\
              \ of a single module with ne dimensions has the same drift load function\
              \ as a landscape composed of m independent modules of size ne,i with\
              \ ∑i ne,i = ne because we have\\n\\nHence the drift load formula that\
              \ we have obtained seems to be robust to many of the assumptions underlying\
              \ FGM.\\n\\n### Other Attempts to Estimate Phenotypic Complexity\\n\\\
              nRecently, another theoretical study developed a framework to estimate\
              \ phenotypic complexity [21]. The model developed used predictions on\
              \ the distribution of mutational effects to estimate complexity. This\
              \ analysis, which is completely independent from ours, found an interesting\
              \ correlation between gene number and complexity in a variety of organisms\
              \ ranging from a virus to C. elegans. However, for all the organisms\
              \ for which enough data existed to perform the analysis, the number\
              \ of phenotypic dimensions estimated was very small; 0.21 phenotypic\
              \ dimensions for E. coli, 1.07 in VSV, 1–2 for S. cerevisiae, and 2–3\
              \ for D. melanogaster and C. elegans. We think that several effects\
              \ may limit the predictive quality such a method. Firstly, mutation\
              \ accumulation methods and the inherent noise in fitness estimates are\
              \ very different across species and comparison across species are thus\
              \ difficult. One illustration of this is the large variability in fitness\
              \ estimates for mutations in a single species using two methods: in\
              \ VSV earlier estimates (using Bateman-Mukai estimates) predicted a\
              \ 0.002 mean fitness effect per mutation, while more recent and accurate\
              \ estimates (which introduced each mutation individually) brought the\
              \ estimate it to 14% (a 70-fold difference). Secondly, neutral mutations\
              \ are not considered in the model developed by Martin and Lenormand.\
              \ However, part of the mutation produced by transposable elements might\
              \ affect genes useless in laboratory conditions and will therefore be\
              \ taken into account in the calculation of mean fitness effects of mutations\
              \ even if they do not affect any phenotype in the laboratory environment.\
              \ Third, contrary to our model, if phenotypes are organized in different\
              \ modules (as many data suggest), their model will provide different\
              \ estimates; in other words, their model requires that all traits can\
              \ be simultaneously affected by a single mutations. All these considerations\
              \ suggest that a second independent model should be used to estimate\
              \ phenotypic complexity.\\n\\nOne of the central FGM hypotheses that\
              \ we have so far not addressed is the single-peaked nature of the landscape.\
              \ Although FGM contains few assumptions about the nature of the genotypic\
              \ landscape, the model explicitly requires a phenotypic landscape containing\
              \ a single peak; without this, then the fitness function, f(d), cannot\
              \ be described by a decreasing function. However, recent experimental\
              \ evidence over large evolutionary time scales strongly suggests that\
              \ while the genotypic landscape may contain multiple peaks, the phenotypic\
              \ landscape is generally much less complex. Several experimental studies\
              \ using microbes have shown that a considerable amount of phenotypic\
              \ convergence occurs during evolution [24]–[27], even when organisms\
              \ begin from different starting points in the landscape [28]. These\
              \ phenomena would only be expected if the phenotypic landscape exhibited\
              \ a single-peak. However, the evidence for ruggedness in the genetic\
              \ landscape is also substantial, especially in experiments that have\
              \ looked at bacterial evolution of resistance to antibiotics [29]. In\
              \ this case, the fitness relationships between the wild type genotypes,\
              \ resistant genotypes, compensated resistant genotypes, and sensitive\
              \ genotypes bearing the compensatory mutation exhibit high levels of\
              \ epistasis, characteristic of a rugged genetic landscape. In other\
              \ studies in which the cost of resistance was associated with a phenotype\
              \ [30], fitness restoration to wild-type level was sometimes observed\
              \ and, more importantly for our concern, it was associated with a restoration\
              \ of the phenotypic damage associated with the occurrence of the resistance\
              \ mutation (transcription efficiency of rifampicin resistant mutants\
              \ was restored back to the level observed in rifampicin sensitive strain).\
              \ This also suggests the singularity of the phenotypic optimum, although\
              \ different genetic combinations may underlie this optimum. However,\
              \ as our model is focusing neither on the genetic nature of the adaptive\
              \ landscape, nor on the rate of adaptation (ruggedness means that several\
              \ mutations could be needed to restore the effect of one) it should\
              \ not be too sensitive to the small level ruggedness of the genetic\
              \ landscape described so far.\\n\\n### The Concept of Phenotypic Complexity\\\
              n\\nAs discussed previously, the quantity denoted by ne is the number\
              \ of genetically uncorrelated phenotypes that are influenced by the\
              \ action of natural selection. The dimensions enumerated by ne are thus\
              \ genetically orthogonal to each other, and analogous to the axes needed\
              \ to describe the variation among multiple phenotypes measured on a\
              \ collection of individuals and mutants in a principal component analysis.\
              \ However, the number of axes enumerated by ne is filtered by natural\
              \ selection, while in a PCA analysis the number of axes is limited only\
              \ by the number of independent phenotypes that are measured. Because\
              \ each phenotype is optimized at a value determined by each organism's\
              \ ecological environment, there is a dependence of phenotypic complexity\
              \ on the complexity of the ecological niche experienced by each organism;\
              \ if natural selection does not act on a phenotype, then that phenotype\
              \ does not contribute to the complexity metric. Finally, although the\
              \ estimates of ne arise from an idealized model of phenotypic evolution;\
              \ as Orr suggested previously, estimates of phenotypic complexity using\
              \ FGM can be viewed as “effective” estimates of phenotypic complexity\
              \ [6]. This concept is analogous to the concept in population genetics\
              \ of effective population size, Ne, in which two populations with different\
              \ numbers of individuals and different sex ratios might have the same\
              \ effective population size and therefore respond similarly to the different\
              \ population genetic forces. Thus two organisms, although they may differ\
              \ in both the underlying genetic mechanisms and in the complexity of\
              \ the environment in which they live, may have similar phenotypic complexities.\
              \ The utility of the concept lies not in the implications it makes about\
              \ specific phenotypes or genetic details, but in that it enables a general\
              \ quantification of how an organism is affected by natural selection\
              \ (the complexity with which natural selection acts), and furthermore,\
              \ how this action affects the evolutionary dynamics of that organism\
              \ [6].\\n\\n### Viral Estimates of Phenotypic Complexity\\n\\nUnsurprisingly,\
              \ our estimates of phenotypic complexity are orders of magnitude smaller\
              \ than either the number of nucleotides or even the number of amino\
              \ acids encoded by the genomes of these organisms (5386 bp and 11,161bp\
              \ in ΦX174 and VSV, respectively). This agrees with the concept of phenotypic\
              \ complexity that we have defined. Although mutations that occur at\
              \ one nucleotide or amino acid do not affect those at another (i.e.\
              \ they are genetically separable phenotypes), it is clearly unlikely\
              \ that each nucleotide or amino acid is independently acted up by natural\
              \ selection. Secondly, each estimate of complexity is greater than the\
              \ number of genes encoded by each virus (11 and 5 for ΦX174 and VSV,\
              \ respectively). The presence of multiple functional domains within\
              \ a single protein is consistent with an estimate of complexity that\
              \ is greater than the number of encoded proteins.\\n\\nAlthough we have\
              \ only two estimates, we can briefly consider them from a comparative\
              \ standpoint: although the genome size of ΦX174 is half of VSV, our\
              \ estimate of phenotypic complexity quantifies ΦX174 as being approximately\
              \ four-fold more complex. It is notable, then, that ΦX174 contains approximately\
              \ twice the number of genes as VSV. Additionally, the lifestyle of ΦX174\
              \ is arguably much more elaborate than that of VSV. ΦX174 interacts\
              \ with several host factors in order to perform transcription and replication;\
              \ 13 host factors are required for replication alone [31]. This can\
              \ be contrasted with VSV, in which transcription and replication are\
              \ similar processes, both performed by the viral polymerase. Few host\
              \ factors (and thus few interactions) are necessary at all during the\
              \ entire life cycle of VSV [32].\\n\\nThese estimates suggest that,\
              \ for very simple organisms such as viruses, phenotypic complexity correlates\
              \ well with the number of genes in an organism, and more specifically,\
              \ with the number of interactions characteristic of that organism [2].\
              \ This observation supports the idea that phenotypic complexity depends\
              \ on the interactions between an organism and its environment. Genome\
              \ size in itself seems to be a poor correlate of phenotypic complexity,\
              \ a notable result in consideration of the very small genome sizes of\
              \ these organisms. Whether such correlations or absence of correlation\
              \ with gene number or genome length would hold for more complex organisms\
              \ remains an open question. Nevertheless, by studying very simple organisms,\
              \ we have shown that the use of drift load could be used to estimate\
              \ complexity in a novel and consistent way. We now propose that such\
              \ a method could be helpful to identify and quantify the strongest determinants\
              \ of biological complexity of higher organisms.\\n\\nAlthough the theory\
              \ presented here appears to be quite robust, it is too early to conclude\
              \ that it is an accurate reflection of the underlying biology. To be\
              \ studied in an FGM framework, organisms need to present at least one\
              \ phenotypic property to selection. Additionally, populations, even\
              \ those of very small size, should evolve towards a fitness equilibrium\
              \ that is explicitly dependent on population size. We found data in\
              \ the literature consistent with this expectation for one organism,\
              \ VSV. We now provide further support for population size-dependent\
              \ fitness equilibria by evolving populations of the bacteriophage ΦX174.\
              \ Together, these two data sets suggest that evolutionary analyses using\
              \ an FGM framework are a valid approach. Moreover, the use of very simple\
              \ organisms such as viruses is useful for gaining insight into metrics\
              \ of complexity, as for such simple organisms, gene number is likely\
              \ to be a very good correlate of organismal complexity, and this should\
              \ be reflected by the metric. Although our observations are currently\
              \ limited to two viral species, it is clear that from both a qualitative\
              \ level (i.e. population size-dependent fitness equilibria), and a quantitative\
              \ level (that the number of phenotypic dimensions are reasonable) that\
              \ the predictions from FGM theory are borne out. An assessment of drift\
              \ load and phenotypic complexity in a greater number of organisms is\
              \ needed before further conclusions can be drawn.\\n\\n### Conclusions\\\
              n\\nHere we have presented a top-down approach to quantifying biological\
              \ complexity. This can be contrasted with previously proposed metrics\
              \ of complexity, which have relied on physically measurable quantities\
              \ of the organism (bottom-up approaches). Two important conceptual differences\
              \ separate these two approaches. Most importantly, phenotypic complexity\
              \ is dependent on both the organism and the environmental context. An\
              \ organism is not complex because it has many measurable phenotypes;\
              \ it is complex because it has many phenotypes on which natural selection\
              \ acts. Secondly, phenotypic complexity does not rely on artificially\
              \ constructed concepts such as genes [33]. As an example, if two genes\
              \ are deemed to be of equal complexity because they are functionally\
              \ equivalent, such a measure necessarily ignores the subtle ways in\
              \ which each may be regulated, or spliced, or expressed within the cell.\
              \ Quantifying such multiple layers of complexity is difficult if the\
              \ metric relies on physically measurable quantities.\\n\\nHowever, phenotypic\
              \ complexity remains an inherently abstract metric. It cannot aid in\
              \ identifying the specific characteristics contributing to the complexity\
              \ of an organism. Instead, it addresses the complexity with which natural\
              \ selection views an organism, and the complexity with which an organism\
              \ is capable of generating novel phenotypic variation. For this reason,\
              \ testing how phenotypic complexity compares to more traditional metrics\
              \ of complexity (for example, the numbers of genes, protein interactions,\
              \ or cellular pathways) may provide significant insight into biological\
              \ systems. Finally, phenotypic complexity (and the resulting equilibrium\
              \ drift load) affords a unique opportunity to contrast the action of\
              \ natural selection between different organisms or different environments\
              \ in a very general and unconstrained manner.\\n\\n## Robustness of\
              \ the Model\\n\\nUsing recent theoretical results we have analytically\
              \ quantified the dependency of the drift load (equilibrium fitness)\
              \ on the effective population size and phenotypic complexity. The linear\
              \ fitness function that has been employed previously to simplify the\
              \ mathematical analyses is no longer necessary. Such a function makes\
              \ strong assumptions about the form of the fitness landscape; specifically,\
              \ mutational effects become very large as fitness is reduced. Thus at\
              \ low fitness most mutations are either lethal or of very large effect,\
              \ a scenario which is incompatible with what we have previously observed\
              \ [14].\\n\\nWe have therefore studied a more general family of fitness\
              \ functions of the form f(d) = exp(−(dQ)), and found that Feq(Ne, ne)\
              \ = (1−(2⋅Ne−1)−1)(ne/Q). It appears that this equation remains valid\
              \ over a much wider range of conditions than those used in the canonical\
              \ FGM, in which mutations are required to be isotropic and fitness isoclines\
              \ are symmetric about the origin. An interesting feature of this formula\
              \ is that it does not require a model in which mutations can affect\
              \ all phenotypic traits simultaneously. In the initial formulation of\
              \ FGM, all phenotypic axes intersect at the origin of each axis. This\
              \ original FGM can be modified slightly such that some phenotypes are\
              \ grouped into separate phenotypic modules, and within a module, all\
              \ phenotypes again intersect at each other's origin. Any mutation that\
              \ occurs within a module can affect only other phenotypes within that\
              \ module, and none that lie outside of it (i.e. there is no pleiotropy\
              \ between modules, an idea similar to previous conceptions of modularity\
              \ [23]). Using the more general description of the equilibrium drift\
              \ load that we have derived above, a phenotypic landscape a composed\
              \ of a single module with ne dimensions has the same drift load function\
              \ as a landscape composed of m independent modules of size ne,i with\
              \ ∑i ne,i = ne because we have\\n\\nHence the drift load formula that\
              \ we have obtained seems to be robust to many of the assumptions underlying\
              \ FGM.\\n\\n## Other Attempts to Estimate Phenotypic Complexity\\n\\\
              nRecently, another theoretical study developed a framework to estimate\
              \ phenotypic complexity [21]. The model developed used predictions on\
              \ the distribution of mutational effects to estimate complexity. This\
              \ analysis, which is completely independent from ours, found an interesting\
              \ correlation between gene number and complexity in a variety of organisms\
              \ ranging from a virus to C. elegans. However, for all the organisms\
              \ for which enough data existed to perform the analysis, the number\
              \ of phenotypic dimensions estimated was very small; 0.21 phenotypic\
              \ dimensions for E. coli, 1.07 in VSV, 1–2 for S. cerevisiae, and 2–3\
              \ for D. melanogaster and C. elegans. We think that several effects\
              \ may limit the predictive quality such a method. Firstly, mutation\
              \ accumulation methods and the inherent noise in fitness estimates are\
              \ very different across species and comparison across species are thus\
              \ difficult. One illustration of this is the large variability in fitness\
              \ estimates for mutations in a single species using two methods: in\

        \ Jean-Philippe Uzan, Lin Chao\\n\\n## Abstract\\n\\n## Background\\nVarious\
        \ definitions of biological complexity have been proposed: the number of genes,\
        \ cell types, or metabolic processes within an organism. As knowledge of biological\
        \ systems has increased, it has become apparent that these metrics are often\
        \ incongruent.\\n## Methodology\\nHere we propose an alternative complexity\
        \ metric based on the number of genetically uncorrelated phenotypic traits\
        \ contributing to an organism's fitness. This metric, phenotypic complexity,\
        \ is more objective than previous suggestions, as complexity is measured from\
        \ a fundamental biological perspective, that of natural selection. We utilize\
        \ a model linking the equilibrium fitness (drift load) of a population to\
        \ phenotypic complexity. We then use results from viral evolution experiments\
        \ to compare the phenotypic complexities of two viruses, the bacteriophage\
        \ X174 and vesicular stomatitis virus, and to illustrate the consistency of\
        \ our approach and its applicability.\\n## Conclusions/Significance\\nBecause\
        \ Darwinian evolution through natural selection is the fundamental element\
        \ unifying all biological organisms, we propose that our metric of complexity\
        \ is potentially a more relevant metric than others, based on the count of\
        \ artificially defined set of objects.\\n\\n## Introduction\\n\\nA persistent\
        \ question in biology is how organismal complexity changes through the course\
        \ of evolution [1]–[5]. Although significant progress has been made in the\
        \ understanding and quantifying organismal characteristics at many level of\
        \ organization (DNA, proteins, metabolic networks, cellular organization,\
        \ organ functions, individual behavior) much confusion remains about how to\
        \ accurately quantify organismal complexity. Several intuitive proposals have\
        \ been made that take into account simple metrics such as the number of genes\
        \ or cell types. However, these simple measures quickly lead to conflicting\
        \ conclusions [2], [3]. Here we propose a fundamentally different approach\
        \ to measuring organismal complexity; as opposed to relying on bottom-up measures\
        \ such as the number of genes an organism has, we utilize an objective biological\
        \ approach: natural selection. Instead of asking how complex an organism is\
        \ from our own perspective, we ask: how complex is an organism from the perspective\
        \ of natural selection? Essentially, this is a top-down metric of organismal\
        \ complexity that we term phenotypic complexity.\\n\\nPhenotypic complexity\
        \ quantifies the number of genetically uncorrelated phenotypic traits contributing\
        \ to an organism's fitness. A phenotypic trait contributes to an organism's\
        \ fitness only to the extent that natural selection acts upon that trait.\
        \ Thus an organismal phenotype that is no longer under selection (for example\
        \ during an evolutionary transition from a generalist to specialist lifestyle),\
        \ although expressed by the organism, contributes nothing to organismal complexity.\
        \ Secondly, if two phenotypes contribute to complexity, they must be genetically\
        \ separable: some mutations must exist that affect one phenotype but not the\
        \ other. If no such mutations exist, then although we may perceive two phenotypes\
        \ under selection, these phenotypes contribute only a single trait toward\
        \ determining phenotypic complexity. As an example consider the affinity of\
        \ an enzyme for a substrate, and the rate at which that substrate is converted\
        \ to product. If there are no mutations that affect one of these traits but\
        \ not the other, then these two phenotypes are considered one, until the organism\
        \ gains the genetic complexity to generate variation in one phenotype without\
        \ affecting the second, for example by evolving functionally separate domains\
        \ in the enzyme. Phenotypic complexity is thus a combined description of how\
        \ natural selection perceives organismal phenotypes and how phenotypic variation\
        \ is generated by the organism. This concept was first articulated by Orr,\
        \ and followed later by others [6]–[8]. Notably, it is similar to physical\
        \ complexity, which is a measure of the amount of information that an organism\
        \ encodes about its environment [4], [5].\\n\\nAn important aspect of measuring\
        \ complexity in this manner is that both the organism and the environment\
        \ affect the metric. An organism with many phenotypes, but living in simple\
        \ environment could thus be just as complex as a simpler organism in the same\
        \ environment. For example, if one organism is capable of metabolizing both\
        \ lactose and glucose, while second can metabolize only glucose, the first\
        \ organism will only be designated as more complex when there is a possibility\
        \ that lactose will be present in the environment.\\n\\nRecent population\
        \ genetic theory [9], [10] has suggested that phenotypic complexity is proportional\
        \ to the drift load, a quantity that describes how equilibrium mean population\
        \ fitness declines with population size. This can be intuitively understood\
        \ in the following manner. An organism's fitness is a result of how successfully\
        \ it interacts with the environment. As the number of interactions (traits)\
        \ increases, it becomes difficult to simultaneously maintain each one. Very\
        \ large populations maintain nearly optimal mean population fitness regardless\
        \ of phenotypic complexity. Small populations can maintain high average fitness\
        \ only when there are a small number of traits (low complexity) each contributing\
        \ a relatively large amount to fitness; if there are a large number of traits\
        \ (high complexity), each contributing only a small amount to fitness, then\
        \ small populations will be incapable of maintaining all of them. Thus for\
        \ complex organisms, there will be a large difference in mean fitness between\
        \ small and large populations; for simple organisms, this difference in average\
        \ fitness will be small.\\n\\nThe phenotypic model used to link drift load\
        \ to phenotypic complexity was first formalized by R. A. Fisher [11]. He envisioned\
        \ a multidimensional phenotypic space in which the origin of each axis corresponded\
        \ to the most-fit or optimum phenotypic value. As phenotypic values depart\
        \ from the origin, fitness decreases. The manner in which fitness declines\
        \ is described by a monotonically decreasing function, which may take a variety\
        \ of shapes, e.g., linear, concave-up, or –down. Individuals of equal fitness\
        \ but different phenotypic values trace out fitness isoclines in the space.\
        \ If an organism has only two phenotypes, the phenotypic space is two-dimensional\
        \ and the fitness isoclines are a series of circles centered on the origin\
        \ of the axes (Fig. 1). If an organism has n number of phenotypes, phenotypic\
        \ space is n-dimensional, and each fitness isocline is an n-dimensional hyper-sphere.\
        \ Because of the assumed geometry of the isoclines, this model is referred\
        \ to as Fisher's Geometric Model (FGM) of phenotypic or adaptive evolution.\\\
        n\\n![Figure: Fisher's geometric model in two-dimensional phenotypic space.Fitness\
        \ varies along two phenotypic axes, with the maximum fitness located, for\
        \ convenience, at the origin of these axes. Any individual in a population\
        \ (black point) can thus be described by its phenotypic values, which determine\
        \ the fitness of that organism. At any specific fitness, there are a number\
        \ of other phenotypic combinations that have equivalent fitness; the values\
        \ of these phenotypic combinations establish the fitness isoclines (black\
        \ circle). From the optimum, fitness declines monotonically according to the\
        \ structure of the landscape (see text). Each mutation (arrow) is drawn from\
        \ a distribution centered on the phenotypic position of each individual, resulting\
        \ in offspring with new phenotypic combinations and fitness values (white\
        \ point).](figure_description)\\n\\nA population of individuals can be represented\
        \ as a collection of points in FGM and the phenotypic values of each point\
        \ allow ascertainment of the fitness of each individual. Individual fitness\
        \ then determines the probability of each individual surviving and reproducing\
        \ the next generation. Evolution is thus described in FGM by following the\
        \ collection of points over many generations. To generate novel genetic variation,\
        \ mutations are drawn from an assumed distribution that is centered on the\
        \ phenotypic position of each individual (Fig. 1). By never descending into\
        \ genotypic space, FGM is analogous to quantitative genetics models. Both\
        \ types of models assume or require only that a component of phenotype is\
        \ heritable. However, whereas quantitative genetic models represent populations\
        \ by their mean and variance, FGM is an individual-based model in which each\
        \ individual is evaluated according to its fitness.\\n\\nFGM makes a set of\
        \ theoretical predictions about how adaptation tends to occur, and many of\
        \ these have been corroborated by experimental results. The greater frequency\
        \ of small-sized beneficial mutations [12], the L-shaped distribution of mutations\
        \ fixed throughout evolution [13], the existence of fitness equilibriums [14],\
        \ and the absence of intrinsically beneficial or intrinsically deleterious\
        \ mutations have all been observed during laboratory evolution, and all conform\
        \ to the conditions set forth under FGM. The model thus appears to offer a\
        \ reasonable framework for the study of microbial evolution.\\n\\nThe utility\
        \ of FGM lies in the fact that it does not require any particular assumptions\
        \ about the map between phenotype and genotype, and that the specific predictions\
        \ about how fitness changes during evolution appear to be robust. In the present\
        \ paper, we further refine previous predictions derived from FGM [9], [10]\
        \ to take into account some fitness functions compatible with experimental\
        \ data and use these results to estimate the phenotypic complexity of two\
        \ viruses evolved in the laboratory.\\n\\n## Model and Results\\n\\nThe link\
        \ between drift load and phenotypic complexity under FGM was first investigated\
        \ by Hartl and Taubes [9] (although Wagner and Gabriel [15] had worked previously\
        \ on a similar question), and was later refined by Poon and Otto [10]. Recent\
        \ theoretical techniques from statistical physics now allow an exact solution\
        \ of FGM for several fitness functions. Sella and Hirsh [16] found that mean\
        \ equilibrium fitness 〈f〉 can be written as\\n\\nIn which ν = 2⋅Ne−1 in the\
        \ diploid case and 2⋅Ne−2 in the haploid, and ρ(f), the density function,\
        \ i.e. the size of fitness f isocline, is dependent on the number of dimensions\
        \ and of the fitness function used.\\n\\n### Linear Fitness Decline\\n\\nIf\
        \ fitness is assumed to be a linearly decreasing function of the phenotypic\
        \ distance to the optimum, then we find that the average fitness is given\
        \ by (Methods, Appendix A):in the diploid case, in which Feq is the equilibrium\
        \ fitness (drift load) expressed as a fraction of the maximum attainable fitness\
        \ of the organism, ne is the effective number of dimensions of the phenotypic\
        \ space (phenotypic complexity; see the below for a more detailed discussion\
        \ of why we term this the effective number of dimensions), and Ne is the effective\
        \ population size. This confirms the results obtained by Poon and Otto who\
        \ approximated Feq(ne, Ne) as 2Ne/(2Ne+ne) [10].\\n\\nAlthough earlier studies\
        \ on FGM model have used such linear fitness functions (for the sake of mathematical\
        \ simplicity), recent experimental studies do not seem to support the use\
        \ of such a function [17]–[19]. Linear fitness functions give rise to dramatic\
        \ synergistic epistasis. For example, a mutation that increases the distance\
        \ to the optimal phenotype by 0.1 units may decrease fitness by 10% in the\
        \ optimal genotype (which by definition has a fitness of 1); an analogous\
        \ mutation will decrease fitness by 50% in an organism with a fitness of 0.2;\
        \ this mutation will become lethal in any genotype with a fitness less than\
        \ 0.1. Recent experimental work suggests that epistasis between deleterious\
        \ mutations is either antagonistic [17]–[19] or null [20]. We therefore decided\
        \ to use a family of exponential fitness functions with a parameter that allows\
        \ control over the level and shape of epistasis.\\n\\n### Exponential-type\
        \ Fitness Decline\\n\\nIn an effort to explore fitness functions more compatible\
        \ with experimental data, we studied the following family of functions. f(d)\
        \ = exp(−(dQ)), in which fitness is an exponentially decaying function of\
        \ the distance to the optimum to the power of Q. Q is a parameter that modifies\
        \ the concavity of the fitness decline. As organisms move away from the optimum\
        \ the effect of the mutation tend to have bigger effect if Q>1 and smaller\
        \ effect if Q<1. In such a case the fitness equilibriums are (Methods, Appendix\
        \ A).\\n\\nThus in the haploid case on which we will focus later:\\n\\nThe\
        \ validity of these results was confirmed by an individual based model of\
        \ simulation analogous to one used previously [6] (Fig. 2).\\n\\n![Figure:\

        n\\n### Robustness of Fitness Equilibrium to FGM Hypothesis\\n\\nThe implementation\
        \ of FGM requires several assumptions in regards to the biology of the organism.\
        \ The distributions of the mutations and the shape of the fitness function\
        \ are required, and the geometry of the fitness isoclines needs to be symmetrical.\
        \ However, we show below that the equilibrium drift load is fairly insensitive\
        \ to these strict assumptions.\\n\\nFirst, as equation (4) suggests, the fitness\
        \ equilibrium is independent of the mutational properties. As long as mutation\
        \ is assumed to be isotropic, only the convergence time to equilibrium, and\
        \ not the equilibrium fitness value, is affected by the distribution of mutational\
        \ effects (data not shown). Second, although the results depend on the shape\
        \ of the fitness function (linear or exponential-type), they are independent\
        \ of the slope: equilibrium values will be the same if f(d) = exp(−αdQ) (Methods,\
        \ Appendix B). Third, although the canonical FGM assumes circular fitness\
        \ isoclines, it can be shown that if fitness isoclines are elliptical instead\
        \ of circular, then the density function is affected, but this cancels out\
        \ in the calculation of fitness equilibrium. This holds for fitness isoclines\
        \ and also for any fitness function of the form f(X) = exp(−∑αixi Q), where\
        \ X = (x0, x1, …, xn) is the coordinate of an individual in FGM, and αi are\
        \ positive parameters (Methods, Appendix B). Finally, if the mutation cloud\
        \ is a Gaussian ellipsoid, it has been shown that an appropriate change of\
        \ axes result in a space in which fitness isoclines are ellipsoid while the\
        \ mutation cloud is circular [21]. Hence it seems that asymmetry in both the\
        \ mutational distribution and the fitness isoclines do not affect the equilibrium\
        \ fitness values, a robustness of the equilibrium fitness confirmed by some\
        \ simulation data (data not shown).\\n\\nThe equilibrium drift load seems\
        \ to be a robust property of FGM that is determined by the number of dimensions\
        \ of phenotypic space, the population size and the fitness function (especially\
        \ its curvature). An accurate estimate of phenotypic complexity can thus be\
        \ obtained if it is possible to estimate equilibrium fitness values (drift\
        \ load) for several population sizes, as well as the amount of curvature in\
        \ the fitness function.\\n\\n### Viral Evolution\\n\\nWe used two sets of\
        \ evolution experiments in which both fitness equilibrium values and fitness\
        \ curvature have been investigated (Fig. 3). In the first set of experiments\
        \ we evolved the bacteriophage ΦX174 on a bacterial lawn of its host, Escherichia\
        \ coli C. We increased the mutation rate of the phage to hasten convergence\
        \ to fitness equilibrium with the use of hydroxylamine; this resulted in a\
        \ mean mutation rate of 0.1 per genome per generation through the 450 generations\
        \ of evolution. Population size-dependent fitness equilibriums were observed,\
        \ confirming that evolution occurred in a manner compatible with the assumptions\
        \ of FGM. From these populations we obtained 21 measures of equilibrium fitness\
        \ at five different population sizes. Every transfer corresponded roughly\
        \ to five phage generations and effective population size was then approximated\
        \ to five times the number of plaques transferred (the harmonic mean).\\n\\\
        n![Figure: Equilibrium drift load as a function of population size for vesicular\
        \ stomatitis virus and ΦX174.Each point indicates the mean fitness of a population.\
        \ The VSV populations are shown in dark grey and the ΦX174 are shown in white.\
        \ Some points have been displaced on the x-axis for clarity. The VSV populations\
        \ were transferred at effective population sizes of four, ten, and 60; the\
        \ ΦX174 populations were transferred at effective population sizes of 15,\
        \ 50, 150, 500, and 1250. The dotted lines specify the maximum likelihood\
        \ estimate of the fref value (the maximum attainable fitness); the dark dotted\
        \ line indicates the value for VSV and the lighter dashed line indicates the\
        \ value for ΦX174.](figure_description)\\n\\nTo estimate the curvature of\
        \ the fitness function we performed a mutation accumulation analysis for high\
        \ and low fitness clones and showed that the distribution of deleterious mutations\
        \ was similar at both ends of the fitness range spanning a 300-fold difference.\
        \ This suggests that there is very little curvature of the fitness function.\\\
        n\\nWe used a second set of data from the literature, in which populations\
        \ were evolved for 20 transfers at different effective sizes. Novella et al.\
        \ [22] evolved four clones of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) using plaque-to-plaque\
        \ transfers of sizes two, five, and 30. They also observed a population size-dependant\
        \ fitness convergence. Although the time for convergence was relatively short\
        \ (40 viral generations), several populations experienced no significant increases\
        \ or decreases in fitness over all replicates at a given population size,\
        \ suggesting that those population were at or near an equilibrium fitness\
        \ value. We used the fitness estimates from 24 populations evolved at population\
        \ sizes of two, five and 30. Every transfer corresponded to roughly two viral\
        \ generations and effective population size was thus approximated as two times\
        \ the number of viral plaques transferred.\\n\\nAdditionally, an impressive\
        \ set of data using site directed mutagenesis in VSV suggests that the concavity\
        \ of fitness function is slightly upward [19]. However, in further analyses\
        \ we estimate Q as 1 for both the phage and the virus, as no clear departure\
        \ from 1 has been observed in either case.\\n\\n### Maximum Likelihood Estimate\
        \ of Phenotypic Complexity\\n\\nWe wish to use the previous mathematical results\
        \ to estimate phenotypic complexity from experimental data. However, there\
        \ are two unknown parameters in the experimental system that affect the equilibrium\
        \ drift load in a population: phenotypic complexity and the maximum attainable\
        \ fitness that can be reached by the viruses in the laboratory environment\
        \ (this parameter has been scaled to one in the previous derivations). Using\
        \ methods from statistical physics, we can find the distribution of population\
        \ fitness at equilibrium (shown above), and thus derive a likelihood model\
        \ that gives the probability of the observed data for each couplet (ne/Q,\
        \ fref), in which ne is the phenotypic complexity, Q a parameter of the curvature\
        \ of the fitness surface, and fref the maximum attainable fitness. We also\
        \ take into account the noise in our experimental assessment of fitness values;\
        \ especially for high fitness populations, noise in the estimates of fitness\
        \ can alter the estimation of fref, as this parameter is by definition higher\
        \ than all fitness measures. Thus rather than using the probability of the\
        \ point estimate of fitness, we integrated the probability between plus (f+)\
        \ and minus (f−) one standard deviation of the point estimate. In Appendix\
        \ C we show that\\n\\n### Estimates of Phenotypic Complexity for VSV and ΦX174\\\
        n\\nWe applied the maximum likelihood estimator to the experimental estimates\
        \ of population fitness for ΦX174 and VSV, and using a likelihood ratio test\
        \ we defined 95% confidence intervals (CI), which we list here in parentheses.\
        \ For ΦX174 we found ne/Q = 45 (42−49), and fref = 1.245 (1.23−1.26), whereas\
        \ for VSV we found ne/Q = 10 (8−12) and fref = 1.98 (1.94−2.05) (Fig. 3).\
        \ In both of these cases, fref is calculated per generation relative to the\
        \ ancestral virus for ΦX174 and relative to a reference strain for VSV. As\
        \ no strong signature of curvature in the fitness surface has been found for\
        \ either virus, we assume that Q is approximately one.\\n\\n## Linear Fitness\
        \ Decline\\n\\nIf fitness is assumed to be a linearly decreasing function\
        \ of the phenotypic distance to the optimum, then we find that the average\
        \ fitness is given by (Methods, Appendix A):in the diploid case, in which\
        \ Feq is the equilibrium fitness (drift load) expressed as a fraction of the\
        \ maximum attainable fitness of the organism, ne is the effective number of\
        \ dimensions of the phenotypic space (phenotypic complexity; see the below\
        \ for a more detailed discussion of why we term this the effective number\
        \ of dimensions), and Ne is the effective population size. This confirms the\
        \ results obtained by Poon and Otto who approximated Feq(ne, Ne) as 2Ne/(2Ne+ne)\
        \ [10].\\n\\nAlthough earlier studies on FGM model have used such linear fitness\
        \ functions (for the sake of mathematical simplicity), recent experimental\
        \ studies do not seem to support the use of such a function [17]–[19]. Linear\
        \ fitness functions give rise to dramatic synergistic epistasis. For example,\
        \ a mutation that increases the distance to the optimal phenotype by 0.1 units\
        \ may decrease fitness by 10% in the optimal genotype (which by definition\
        \ has a fitness of 1); an analogous mutation will decrease fitness by 50%\
        \ in an organism with a fitness of 0.2; this mutation will become lethal in\
        \ any genotype with a fitness less than 0.1. Recent experimental work suggests\
        \ that epistasis between deleterious mutations is either antagonistic [17]–[19]\
        \ or null [20]. We therefore decided to use a family of exponential fitness\

        \ of epistasis.\\n\\n## Exponential-type Fitness Decline\\n\\nIn an effort\

        \ ancestral virus for ΦX174 and relative to a reference strain for VSV. As\
        \ no strong signature of curvature in the fitness surface has been found for\
        \ either virus, we assume that Q is approximately one.\\n\\n## Discussion\\\
        n\\nTo understand how biological complexity changes during the course of evolution,\
        \ a metric is needed. Previously, measures such as the number of genes, cell\
        \ types or metabolic processes have been proposed, but they often lead to\
        \ incongruent results. Organisms with more cell types do not necessarily have\
        \ more genes. Here we suggest that a metric unifying biological systems has\
        \ not been appropriately identified. To circumvent this problem, we have developed\
        \ a metric of biological complexity termed phenotypic complexity (ne). We\
        \ have quantified this metric in the viruses ΦX174 and VSV by utilizing a\
        \ population genetic model that describes how phenotypic complexity affects\
        \ the drift load that a population experiences.\\n\\nPhenotypic complexity\
        \ (ne) is a measure of the number of genetically uncorrelated phenotypes that\
        \ are acted upon by natural selection. Because Darwinian evolution through\
        \ natural selection is the fundamental element unifying all biological organisms,\
        \ we propose that ne is potentially a more relevant metric than those previously\
        \ suggested.\\n\\n### Robustness of the Model\\n\\nUsing recent theoretical\
        \ results we have analytically quantified the dependency of the drift load\
        \ (equilibrium fitness) on the effective population size and phenotypic complexity.\
        \ The linear fitness function that has been employed previously to simplify\
        \ the mathematical analyses is no longer necessary. Such a function makes\
        \ strong assumptions about the form of the fitness landscape; specifically,\
        \ mutational effects become very large as fitness is reduced. Thus at low\
        \ fitness most mutations are either lethal or of very large effect, a scenario\
        \ which is incompatible with what we have previously observed [14].\\n\\nWe\
        \ have therefore studied a more general family of fitness functions of the\
        \ form f(d) = exp(−(dQ)), and found that Feq(Ne, ne) = (1−(2⋅Ne−1)−1)(ne/Q).\
        \ It appears that this equation remains valid over a much wider range of conditions\
        \ than those used in the canonical FGM, in which mutations are required to\
        \ be isotropic and fitness isoclines are symmetric about the origin. An interesting\
        \ feature of this formula is that it does not require a model in which mutations\
        \ can affect all phenotypic traits simultaneously. In the initial formulation\
        \ of FGM, all phenotypic axes intersect at the origin of each axis. This original\
        \ FGM can be modified slightly such that some phenotypes are grouped into\
        \ separate phenotypic modules, and within a module, all phenotypes again intersect\
        \ at each other's origin. Any mutation that occurs within a module can affect\
        \ only other phenotypes within that module, and none that lie outside of it\
        \ (i.e. there is no pleiotropy between modules, an idea similar to previous\
        \ conceptions of modularity [23]). Using the more general description of the\
        \ equilibrium drift load that we have derived above, a phenotypic landscape\
        \ a composed of a single module with ne dimensions has the same drift load\
        \ function as a landscape composed of m independent modules of size ne,i with\
        \ ∑i ne,i = ne because we have\\n\\nHence the drift load formula that we have\
        \ obtained seems to be robust to many of the assumptions underlying FGM.\\\
        n\\n### Other Attempts to Estimate Phenotypic Complexity\\n\\nRecently, another\
        \ theoretical study developed a framework to estimate phenotypic complexity\
        \ [21]. The model developed used predictions on the distribution of mutational\
        \ effects to estimate complexity. This analysis, which is completely independent\
        \ from ours, found an interesting correlation between gene number and complexity\
        \ in a variety of organisms ranging from a virus to C. elegans. However, for\
        \ all the organisms for which enough data existed to perform the analysis,\
        \ the number of phenotypic dimensions estimated was very small; 0.21 phenotypic\
        \ dimensions for E. coli, 1.07 in VSV, 1–2 for S. cerevisiae, and 2–3 for\
        \ D. melanogaster and C. elegans. We think that several effects may limit\
        \ the predictive quality such a method. Firstly, mutation accumulation methods\
        \ and the inherent noise in fitness estimates are very different across species\
        \ and comparison across species are thus difficult. One illustration of this\
        \ is the large variability in fitness estimates for mutations in a single\
        \ species using two methods: in VSV earlier estimates (using Bateman-Mukai\
        \ estimates) predicted a 0.002 mean fitness effect per mutation, while more\
        \ recent and accurate estimates (which introduced each mutation individually)\
        \ brought the estimate it to 14% (a 70-fold difference). Secondly, neutral\
        \ mutations are not considered in the model developed by Martin and Lenormand.\
        \ However, part of the mutation produced by transposable elements might affect\
        \ genes useless in laboratory conditions and will therefore be taken into\
        \ account in the calculation of mean fitness effects of mutations even if\
        \ they do not affect any phenotype in the laboratory environment. Third, contrary\
        \ to our model, if phenotypes are organized in different modules (as many\
        \ data suggest), their model will provide different estimates; in other words,\
        \ their model requires that all traits can be simultaneously affected by a\
        \ single mutations. All these considerations suggest that a second independent\
        \ model should be used to estimate phenotypic complexity.\\n\\nOne of the\
        \ central FGM hypotheses that we have so far not addressed is the single-peaked\
        \ nature of the landscape. Although FGM contains few assumptions about the\
        \ nature of the genotypic landscape, the model explicitly requires a phenotypic\
        \ landscape containing a single peak; without this, then the fitness function,\
        \ f(d), cannot be described by a decreasing function. However, recent experimental\
        \ evidence over large evolutionary time scales strongly suggests that while\
        \ the genotypic landscape may contain multiple peaks, the phenotypic landscape\
        \ is generally much less complex. Several experimental studies using microbes\
        \ have shown that a considerable amount of phenotypic convergence occurs during\
        \ evolution [24]–[27], even when organisms begin from different starting points\
        \ in the landscape [28]. These phenomena would only be expected if the phenotypic\
        \ landscape exhibited a single-peak. However, the evidence for ruggedness\
        \ in the genetic landscape is also substantial, especially in experiments\
        \ that have looked at bacterial evolution of resistance to antibiotics [29].\
        \ In this case, the fitness relationships between the wild type genotypes,\
        \ resistant genotypes, compensated resistant genotypes, and sensitive genotypes\
        \ bearing the compensatory mutation exhibit high levels of epistasis, characteristic\
        \ of a rugged genetic landscape. In other studies in which the cost of resistance\
        \ was associated with a phenotype [30], fitness restoration to wild-type level\
        \ was sometimes observed and, more importantly for our concern, it was associated\
        \ with a restoration of the phenotypic damage associated with the occurrence\
        \ of the resistance mutation (transcription efficiency of rifampicin resistant\
        \ mutants was restored back to the level observed in rifampicin sensitive\
        \ strain). This also suggests the singularity of the phenotypic optimum, although\
        \ different genetic combinations may underlie this optimum. However, as our\
        \ model is focusing neither on the genetic nature of the adaptive landscape,\
        \ nor on the rate of adaptation (ruggedness means that several mutations could\
        \ be needed to restore the effect of one) it should not be too sensitive to\
        \ the small level ruggedness of the genetic landscape described so far.\\\
        n\\n### The Concept of Phenotypic Complexity\\n\\nAs discussed previously,\
        \ the quantity denoted by ne is the number of genetically uncorrelated phenotypes\
        \ that are influenced by the action of natural selection. The dimensions enumerated\
        \ by ne are thus genetically orthogonal to each other, and analogous to the\
        \ axes needed to describe the variation among multiple phenotypes measured\
        \ on a collection of individuals and mutants in a principal component analysis.\
        \ However, the number of axes enumerated by ne is filtered by natural selection,\
        \ while in a PCA analysis the number of axes is limited only by the number\
        \ of independent phenotypes that are measured. Because each phenotype is optimized\
        \ at a value determined by each organism's ecological environment, there is\
        \ a dependence of phenotypic complexity on the complexity of the ecological\
        \ niche experienced by each organism; if natural selection does not act on\
        \ a phenotype, then that phenotype does not contribute to the complexity metric.\
        \ Finally, although the estimates of ne arise from an idealized model of phenotypic\
        \ evolution; as Orr suggested previously, estimates of phenotypic complexity\
        \ using FGM can be viewed as “effective” estimates of phenotypic complexity\
        \ [6]. This concept is analogous to the concept in population genetics of\
        \ effective population size, Ne, in which two populations with different numbers\
        \ of individuals and different sex ratios might have the same effective population\
        \ size and therefore respond similarly to the different population genetic\
        \ forces. Thus two organisms, although they may differ in both the underlying\
        \ genetic mechanisms and in the complexity of the environment in which they\
        \ live, may have similar phenotypic complexities. The utility of the concept\
        \ lies not in the implications it makes about specific phenotypes or genetic\
        \ details, but in that it enables a general quantification of how an organism\
        \ is affected by natural selection (the complexity with which natural selection\
        \ acts), and furthermore, how this action affects the evolutionary dynamics\
        \ of that organism [6].\\n\\n### Viral Estimates of Phenotypic Complexity\\\
        n\\nUnsurprisingly, our estimates of phenotypic complexity are orders of magnitude\
        \ smaller than either the number of nucleotides or even the number of amino\
        \ acids encoded by the genomes of these organisms (5386 bp and 11,161bp in\
        \ ΦX174 and VSV, respectively). This agrees with the concept of phenotypic\
        \ complexity that we have defined. Although mutations that occur at one nucleotide\
        \ or amino acid do not affect those at another (i.e. they are genetically\
        \ separable phenotypes), it is clearly unlikely that each nucleotide or amino\
        \ acid is independently acted up by natural selection. Secondly, each estimate\
        \ of complexity is greater than the number of genes encoded by each virus\
        \ (11 and 5 for ΦX174 and VSV, respectively). The presence of multiple functional\
        \ domains within a single protein is consistent with an estimate of complexity\
        \ that is greater than the number of encoded proteins.\\n\\nAlthough we have\
        \ only two estimates, we can briefly consider them from a comparative standpoint:\
        \ although the genome size of ΦX174 is half of VSV, our estimate of phenotypic\
        \ complexity quantifies ΦX174 as being approximately four-fold more complex.\
        \ It is notable, then, that ΦX174 contains approximately twice the number\
        \ of genes as VSV. Additionally, the lifestyle of ΦX174 is arguably much more\
        \ elaborate than that of VSV. ΦX174 interacts with several host factors in\
        \ order to perform transcription and replication; 13 host factors are required\
        \ for replication alone [31]. This can be contrasted with VSV, in which transcription\
        \ and replication are similar processes, both performed by the viral polymerase.\
        \ Few host factors (and thus few interactions) are necessary at all during\
        \ the entire life cycle of VSV [32].\\n\\nThese estimates suggest that, for\
        \ very simple organisms such as viruses, phenotypic complexity correlates\
        \ well with the number of genes in an organism, and more specifically, with\
        \ the number of interactions characteristic of that organism [2]. This observation\
        \ supports the idea that phenotypic complexity depends on the interactions\
        \ between an organism and its environment. Genome size in itself seems to\
        \ be a poor correlate of phenotypic complexity, a notable result in consideration\
        \ of the very small genome sizes of these organisms. Whether such correlations\
        \ or absence of correlation with gene number or genome length would hold for\
        \ more complex organisms remains an open question. Nevertheless, by studying\
        \ very simple organisms, we have shown that the use of drift load could be\
        \ used to estimate complexity in a novel and consistent way. We now propose\
        \ that such a method could be helpful to identify and quantify the strongest\
        \ determinants of biological complexity of higher organisms.\\n\\nAlthough\
        \ the theory presented here appears to be quite robust, it is too early to\
        \ conclude that it is an accurate reflection of the underlying biology. To\
        \ be studied in an FGM framework, organisms need to present at least one phenotypic\
        \ property to selection. Additionally, populations, even those of very small\
        \ size, should evolve towards a fitness equilibrium that is explicitly dependent\
        \ on population size. We found data in the literature consistent with this\
        \ expectation for one organism, VSV. We now provide further support for population\
        \ size-dependent fitness equilibria by evolving populations of the bacteriophage\
        \ ΦX174. Together, these two data sets suggest that evolutionary analyses\
        \ using an FGM framework are a valid approach. Moreover, the use of very simple\
        \ organisms such as viruses is useful for gaining insight into metrics of\
        \ complexity, as for such simple organisms, gene number is likely to be a\
        \ very good correlate of organismal complexity, and this should be reflected\
        \ by the metric. Although our observations are currently limited to two viral\
        \ species, it is clear that from both a qualitative level (i.e. population\
        \ size-dependent fitness equilibria), and a quantitative level (that the number\
        \ of phenotypic dimensions are reasonable) that the predictions from FGM theory\
        \ are borne out. An assessment of drift load and phenotypic complexity in\
        \ a greater number of organisms is needed before further conclusions can be\
        \ drawn.\\n\\n### Conclusions\\n\\nHere we have presented a top-down approach\
        \ to quantifying biological complexity. This can be contrasted with previously\
        \ proposed metrics of complexity, which have relied on physically measurable\
        \ quantities of the organism (bottom-up approaches). Two important conceptual\
        \ differences separate these two approaches. Most importantly, phenotypic\
        \ complexity is dependent on both the organism and the environmental context.\
        \ An organism is not complex because it has many measurable phenotypes; it\
        \ is complex because it has many phenotypes on which natural selection acts.\
        \ Secondly, phenotypic complexity does not rely on artificially constructed\
        \ concepts such as genes [33]. As an example, if two genes are deemed to be\
        \ of equal complexity because they are functionally equivalent, such a measure\
        \ necessarily ignores the subtle ways in which each may be regulated, or spliced,\
        \ or expressed within the cell. Quantifying such multiple layers of complexity\
        \ is difficult if the metric relies on physically measurable quantities.\\\
        n\\nHowever, phenotypic complexity remains an inherently abstract metric.\
        \ It cannot aid in identifying the specific characteristics contributing to\
        \ the complexity of an organism. Instead, it addresses the complexity with\
        \ which natural selection views an organism, and the complexity with which\
        \ an organism is capable of generating novel phenotypic variation. For this\
        \ reason, testing how phenotypic complexity compares to more traditional metrics\
        \ of complexity (for example, the numbers of genes, protein interactions,\
        \ or cellular pathways) may provide significant insight into biological systems.\
        \ Finally, phenotypic complexity (and the resulting equilibrium drift load)\
        \ affords a unique opportunity to contrast the action of natural selection\
        \ between different organisms or different environments in a very general\
        \ and unconstrained manner.\\n\\n## Robustness of the Model\\n\\nUsing recent\
        \ theoretical results we have analytically quantified the dependency of the\
        \ drift load (equilibrium fitness) on the effective population size and phenotypic\
        \ complexity. The linear fitness function that has been employed previously\
        \ to simplify the mathematical analyses is no longer necessary. Such a function\
        \ makes strong assumptions about the form of the fitness landscape; specifically,\
        \ mutational effects become very large as fitness is reduced. Thus at low\
        \ fitness most mutations are either lethal or of very large effect, a scenario\
        \ which is incompatible with what we have previously observed [14].\\n\\nWe\
        \ have therefore studied a more general family of fitness functions of the\
        \ form f(d) = exp(−(dQ)), and found that Feq(Ne, ne) = (1−(2⋅Ne−1)−1)(ne/Q).\
        \ It appears that this equation remains valid over a much wider range of conditions\
        \ than those used in the canonical FGM, in which mutations are required to\
        \ be isotropic and fitness isoclines are symmetric about the origin. An interesting\
        \ feature of this formula is that it does not require a model in which mutations\
        \ can affect all phenotypic traits simultaneously. In the initial formulation\
        \ of FGM, all phenotypic axes intersect at the origin of each axis. This original\
        \ FGM can be modified slightly such that some phenotypes are grouped into\
        \ separate phenotypic modules, and within a module, all phenotypes again intersect\
        \ at each other's origin. Any mutation that occurs within a module can affect\
        \ only other phenotypes within that module, and none that lie outside of it\
        \ (i.e. there is no pleiotropy between modules, an idea similar to previous\
        \ conceptions of modularity [23]). Using the more general description of the\
        \ equilibrium drift load that we have derived above, a phenotypic landscape\
        \ a composed of a single module with ne dimensions has the same drift load\
        \ function as a landscape composed of m independent modules of size ne,i with\
        \ ∑i ne,i = ne because we have\\n\\nHence the drift load formula that we have\
        \ obtained seems to be robust to many of the assumptions underlying FGM.\\\
        n\\n## Other Attempts to Estimate Phenotypic Complexity\\n\\nRecently, another\
        \ theoretical study developed a framework to estimate phenotypic complexity\
        \ [21]. The model developed used predictions on the distribution of mutational\
        \ effects to estimate complexity. This analysis, which is completely independent\
        \ from ours, found an interesting correlation between gene number and complexity\
        \ in a variety of organisms ranging from a virus to C. elegans. However, for\
        \ all the organisms for which enough data existed to perform the analysis,\
        \ the number of phenotypic dimensions estimated was very small; 0.21 phenotypic\
        \ dimensions for E. coli, 1.07 in VSV, 1–2 for S. cerevisiae, and 2–3 for\
        \ D. melanogaster and C. elegans. We think that several effects may limit\
        \ the predictive quality such a method. Firstly, mutation accumulation methods\
        \ and the inherent noise in fitness estimates are very different across species\

  expected_output: Nanodiamonds and Au NPs were introduced into WS1 cells via silicon
    nanowire-mediated delivery15. Silicon nanowires were treated with 3-amino-propyltrimethoxysilane
    to present NH2 functionality on the surface, and nanodiamonds / Au NPs were subsequently
    attached via electrostatic binding. Afterwards, human embryonic fibroblast WS1
    cells were plated on the silicon nanowire substrates and cultured overnight. The
    cells were removed by trypsin treatment and re-plated on a glass slide with lithographically
    defined strip lines for ESR measurements. The samples were stained with calcein-AM
    and ethidium homodimer-1 for the live/dead assay.

  reason: The response fails to provide the correct last sentence before the Acknowledgements
    section. It incorrectly states a sentence about subset seeds outperforming spaced
    seeds, which is not present in the expected output. The actual last sentence about
    future work and combining spaced seeds with other techniques is completely omitted.
    While the response attempts to be thorough in its search process, it ultimately
    provides inaccurate information.

    Based on the HTML content I retrieved from the PMC article, I can see that the
    paper has an Acknowledgments section (note the spelling "Acknowledgments" rather
    than "Acknowledgements"). Looking at the context before the Acknowledgments section,
    I can identify the last sentence before it.


    From the HTML content, I can see that right before the Acknowledgments section,
    there is a table showing experimental results. The last sentence before the Acknowledgments
    section appears to be part of the conclusion of the experimental results table.


    Looking at the content, the last sentence before the Acknowledgments section is:


    **"The table shows that for all tested values of n, the best subset seed outperforms
    the best ordinary spaced seed."**


    This sentence concludes the discussion of the experimental results in Table 3,
    which compares subset seeds with spaced seeds for different values of n (seed
    lengths), and immediately precedes the Acknowledgments section.'

              \ to compute the seed sensitivity, that can be applied to different\
              \ definitions of seeds. It treats separately three components of the\
              \ seed sensitivity problem--a set of target alignments, an associated\
              \ probability distribution, and a seed model--that are specified by\
              \ distinct finite automata. The approach is then applied to a new concept\
              \ of subset seeds for which we propose an efficient automaton construction.\
              \ Experimental results confirm that sensitive subset seeds can be efficiently\
              \ designed using our approach, and can then be used in similarity search\
              \ producing better results than ordinary spaced seeds.\",\n  \"affiliation\"\

          section, I can identify the last sentence before it.


          From the HTML content, I can see that right before the Acknowledgments section,
          there is a table showing experimental results. The last sentence before
          the Acknowledgments section appears to be part of the conclusion of the
          experimental results table.


          Looking at the content, the last sentence before the Acknowledgments section
          is:


          **"The table shows that for all tested values of n, the best subset seed
          outperforms the best ordinary spaced seed."**


          This sentence concludes the discussion of the experimental results in Table
          3, which compares subset seeds with spaced seeds for different values of
          n (seed lengths), and immediately precedes the Acknowledgments section.'

        \ by distinct finite automata. The approach is then applied to a new concept\

  expected_output: As far as the future work is concerned, it would be interesting
    to study the design of efficient spaced seeds for protein sequence search (see
    [6]), as well as to combine spaced seeds with other techniques such as seed families
    [17, 20, 16] or the group hit criterion [19].

              \ with disease variability in a widely used mouse model of colitis\\\
              n\\n**Authors:** Samuel C. Forster, Simon Clare, Benjamin S. Beresford-Jones,\
              \ Katherine Harcourt, George Notley, Mark D. Stares, Nitin Kumar, Amelia\
              \ T. Soderholm, Anne Adoum, Hannah Wong, Bélen Morón, Cordelia Brandt,\

              \ Trevor D. Lawley\\n\\n## Abstract\\n\\nExperimental mouse models are\
              \ central to basic biomedical research; however, variability exists\
              \ across genetically identical mice and mouse facilities making comparisons\
              \ difficult. Whether specific indigenous gut bacteria drive immunophenotypic\
              \ variability in mouse models of human disease remains poorly understood.\
              \ We performed a large-scale experiment using 579 genetically identical\
              \ laboratory mice from a single animal facility, designed to identify\
              \ the causes of disease variability in the widely used dextran sulphate\
              \ sodium mouse model of inflammatory bowel disease. Commonly used treatment\
              \ endpoint measures—weight loss and intestinal pathology—showed limited\
              \ correlation and varied across mouse lineages. Analysis of the gut\
              \ microbiome, coupled with machine learning and targeted anaerobic culturing,\
              \ identified and isolated two previously undescribed species, Duncaniella\
              \ muricolitica and Alistipes okayasuensis, and demonstrated that they\
              \ exert dominant effects in the dextran sulphate sodium model leading\
              \ to variable treatment endpoint measures. We show that the identified\
              \ gut microbial species are common, but not ubiquitous, in mouse facilities\
              \ around the world, and suggest that researchers monitor for these species\
              \ to provide experimental design opportunities for improved mouse models\
              \ of human intestinal diseases.\\n\\n## Main\\n\\nExperimental mouse\
              \ models are central to basic biomedical research and serve as important\
              \ preclinical models in drug discovery for a variety of human diseases,\
              \ including autoimmune and metabolic disorders, cancers and infections.\
              \ Unfortunately, there is tremendous variability in disease penetrance\
              \ and reproducibility among genetically identical mice within and between\
              \ mouse facilities, limiting the utility of many commonly used models1–3.\
              \ Specific-pathogen-free (SPF) protocols have been successfully employed\
              \ to control the confounding effects that can be caused by known bacterial\
              \ pathogens, but we lack equivalent knowledge of the effects of the\
              \ diverse, uncharacterized symbiotic bacteria within the indigenous\
              \ gut microbiota of mice. While our knowledge of the human gut microbiota\
              \ in health and disease has expanded extensively with large-scale microbiome\
              \ studies, comprehensive computational bacterial discovery4,5 and extensive\
              \ genome-sequenced bacterial collections6–9, equivalent investigations\
              \ in mouse models have remained limited. The vast differences in species\
              \ type, composition and dispersal between human and mouse microbiotas\
              \ highlight the importance of efforts to culture mouse-specific bacteria\
              \ and to validate their functions during intestinal homeostasis and\
              \ disease10,11.\\n\\nInflammatory bowel disease (IBD) research relies\
              \ heavily on laboratory mice to understand colitis and the role of host\
              \ genetics in disease resistance and susceptibility. Detailed immune\
              \ characterization shows colitis induction with specific microbial communities12\
              \ or species colonization with Helicobacter spp.13,14, Enterobacteriaceae15,\
              \ Bilophila wadsworthia16 or segmented filamentous bacteria17. Potential\
              \ genetic modulators of IBD are routinely assessed through administration\
              \ of dextran sulphate sodium (DSS) at various concentrations in drinking\
              \ water, which acts by damaging the gut epithelial barrier to trigger\
              \ inflammatory disease12,13. In germ-free mice, immune-mediated colitis\
              \ is largely absent although reduced barrier function can introduce\
              \ susceptibility at higher DSS concentrations18. Similarly, dietary\
              \ changes in both germ-free and SPF mice can determine DSS susceptibility\
              \ in a microbiome-dependent and -independent manner19, and highly specific\
              \ protection is provided by the presence of Clostridium immunis20–23.\
              \ Despite these advances, the gut microbiota in these mouse models,\
              \ including standard SPF models, is rarely profiled at the genomic level\
              \ or cultured in the laboratory, nor robustly controlled to understand\
              \ the contribution of general gut bacteria to experimental outcomes.\\\
              n\\nTo quantify the variability of the widely used DSS model of IBD\
              \ and to investigate primary factors contributing to this variability,\
              \ we undertook a large-scale experiment using 579 genetically identical\
              \ laboratory mice in a single animal facility. Incorporating standardized\
              \ phenotyping, microbiome analysis and metadata collection, this approach\
              \ was designed to identify and validate the causes of variability for\
              \ standard experimental endpoints (weight loss and intestinal pathology).\
              \ Using a data-driven approach we identified, from gut microbiome data,\
              \ candidate bacterial taxa driving weight loss and intestinal inflammation.\
              \ Functional validation with cultured isolates suggests that these specific\
              \ bacterial strains can determine experimental outcomes in gnotobiotic\
              \ mice. Thus, using an experimental approach for microbiome discovery,\
              \ we identified the previously undescribed mouse gut bacteria Duncaniella\
              \ muricolitica and Alistipes okayasuensis, found frequently in mouse\
              \ colonies around the world, that impact outcomes in the DSS model of\
              \ colitis and may be acting as pathobionts.\\n\\n## Results\\n\\n###\
              \ Disease severity is highly variable in the DSS mouse model\\n\\nWe\
              \ administered 1.5% DSS through the drinking water for 7 days to 579\
              \ identically housed, SPF wild-type C57BL/6N mice (297 males, 282 females;\
              \ median age 11 weeks; s.d. 12 days) from 14 distinct parental lineages\
              \ (that is, founder matings derived from a single breeding pair). We\
              \ observed extensive variability in experimental endpoints in these\
              \ genetically identical mice at 10 days post DSS treatment, with histological\
              \ assessment of intestinal pathology of the mid and distal colon ranging\
              \ from severe inflammation, characterized by extensive crypt loss, leukocytic\
              \ infiltration and edema, to no visible inflammation (Fig. 1a,b). Substantial\
              \ variation was also observed in the weight change of mice treated with\
              \ DSS, with the response ranging from 12% weight gain to 30% weight\
              \ loss across the cohort (Fig. 1c). Regression analysis considering\
              \ histology scores and weight loss demonstrated limited correlation\
              \ (R2 = 0.27), suggesting that weight loss and intestinal pathology\
              \ outcomes, common experimental endpoint measures in the DSS model,\
              \ may be partially independent responses to DSS (Fig. 1d). This relationship\
              \ is consistent with systemic complications contributing to experimental\
              \ endpoints in the DSS model.Fig. 1Disease severity is highly variable\

              n### Gut microbiota is major driver of variable response to DSS\\n\\\
              nTo identify the primary factors determining disease outcome, we established\
              \ a random forest classifier model incorporating mouse sex, age, lineage,\
              \ parents, mouse room and experimental date to assess the relative importance\
              \ of each of these factors (Extended Data Fig. 1). The strongest predictive\
              \ factor for weight loss and histology score, both together and independently\
              \ in these genetically identical C57BL/6N mice maintained under standardized\
              \ SPF conditions within the same facility, was parental lineage, with\
              \ correlation analysis confirming these associations (P < 0.01, Kruskal–Wallis;\
              \ Extended Data Fig. 1).\\n\\nSince all mice were derived from the same\
              \ genetic founder stock, the most likely mediator of their DSS phenotype\
              \ was an extrinsic lineage-specific factor. However, to exclude the\
              \ role of host genetics or epigenetic differences between colonies,\
              \ and to determine whether the microbiota alone could be responsible\
              \ for the observed phenotypic variation, fecal samples were collected\
              \ from SPF mice (without DSS treatment) from parental lineages that\
              \ represented extremes of disease outcome and were used to colonize\
              \ C57BL/6N germ-free mice. These colonized recipient mice were then\
              \ subjected to DSS treatment involving daily weight measurements, with\
              \ colon sections collected and analyzed histologically 10 days after\
              \ the initiation of DSS treatment. Recipient mice exhibited both weight\
              \ loss and pathology scores not statistically different from those observed\
              \ in the respective donor mouse lineages, but differing significantly\
              \ between disease- and non-associated lineages (P = 0.0002, paired t-test;\
              \ Fig. 2a). From these results it is clear that, independent of other\
              \ factors such as host genetics or epigenetic lineage-specific factors,\
              \ the microbiota is sufficient to produce the observed variation in\
              \ phenotypic response to DSS administration.Fig. 2Discovery of candidate\

              \ drive disease variability\\n\\nHaving established the importance of\
              \ the microbiota in mediation of phenotypic outcomes to DSS in genetically\
              \ identical mice, we next sought to understand the degree of variability\
              \ in the mouse microbiota across a single facility, and to define changes\
              \ in the microbiota that occur with DSS treatment. Fecal samples were\
              \ collected before DSS treatment and 10 days after DSS exposure, and\
              \ subjected to taxonomic profiling with 16 S ribosomal RNA amplicon\
              \ sequencing to determine microbiota community composition. Consistent\
              \ with previous reports of gastrointestinal inflammation, this analysis\
              \ demonstrated a clear separation of microbiome community between pre-\
              \ and post-DSS samples (Fig. 2b,c and Extended Data Figs. 2 and 3) and\
              \ a significant reduction in bacterial diversity (Shannon diversity\
              \ index, P = 0.0357; Fig. 2d)12. Although expansion of Proteobacteria\
              \ is often associated with gut microbiome dysbiosis, while an increase\
              \ in Proteobacteria was observed post DSS (P < 0.05, Kolmogorov–Smirnov\
              \ test), limited association was observed between weight loss and Proteobacteria\
              \ proportion either pre (Fig. 2e; Spearman correlation, 0.196) or post\
              \ DSS treatment (Fig. 2e; Spearman correlation, −0.289). This suggests\
              \ that other gut bacteria may be contributing to the observed variation\
              \ in DSS resistance and susceptibility.\\n\\nGiven the transmissibility\
              \ of disease phenotype we observed in the germ-free mouse experiments,\
              \ we reasoned that the observed phenotypic variation was primarily dependent\
              \ on baseline microbiota composition before DSS treatment. To understand\
              \ the composition of microbiota associated with increased risk of disease\
              \ outcome, we applied linear discriminant analysis to gut microbiota\
              \ composition before and after DSS exposure24. This unsupervised analysis\
              \ leveraged the variability between mouse lineage-specific bacteria\
              \ to identify the bacterial taxa that most closely predict DSS response.\
              \ Using this approach, we identified two statistically different bacterial\
              \ taxa associated with no disease, and five statistically different\
              \ bacterial taxa associated with >5% weight loss. Notably, no relationship\
              \ was observed between the occurrence or abundance of these isolates\
              \ in mice before DSS exposure, and equivalent predictive bacterial taxa\
              \ were not identified within the microbiota of mice after DSS exposure.\
              \ Our results suggest that the presence of specific gut bacterial taxa\
              \ before DSS exposure may influence disease severity and outcome, possibly\
              \ by either priming or protection from disease.\\n\\n### Isolation of\
              \ bacterial species for functional validation\\n\\nWhile we show clear\
              \ associations between specific bacterial taxa and DSS-mediated disease\
              \ outcome using 16 S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing, accurate taxonomic\
              \ identification to strain level and experimental validation require\
              \ the isolation and genome sequencing of pure clonal cultures of bacterial\
              \ strains. To target and purify bacterial strains, we next performed\
              \ broad-based culture of ~2,000 bacterial colonies from mouse fecal\
              \ samples. The resulting isolates were identified by capillary 16 S\
              \ rRNA gene sequencing and included four previously identified bacterial\
              \ taxa, two ‘disease associated’ and two ‘health associated’. These\
              \ isolates were subjected to whole-genome sequencing and genomic analysis\
              \ to aid in precise taxonomic and phylogenetic assignment (Extended\
              \ Data Fig. 4). In addition, we performed extensive phenotypic characterization\
              \ and comparative genome analyses of these four species (Methods) as\
              \ a basis to provisionally name the health-associated bacteria Anaerostipes\
              \ faecis and Sangeribacter muris and the disease-associated bacteria\
              \ Duncaniella muricolitica and Alistipes okayasuensis; of note, the\
              \ last three species are mouse specific. Examination of the relative\
              \ abundance of each of these species before DSS treatment identified\
              \ significantly higher levels of A. faecis (P = 0264, t-test) and S.\
              \ muris (P = 0.0010, t-test) in those mice without weight loss, and\
              \ significantly higher levels of D. muricolitica (P = 0.0351, t-test)\
              \ and A. okayasuensis (P = 0.0006, t-test) in mice that experienced\
              \ >5% weight loss (Fig. 2f).\\n\\nWe next repeated the DSS experimental\
              \ model in either germ-free mice or germ-free mice stably monocolonized\
              \ for 4 weeks with one of these four bacterial strains (Extended Data\
              \ Figs. 5a and 6). Control germ-free mice treated with DSS neither lost\
              \ weight (Fig. 3a) nor experienced mortality (Fig. 3b) over the course\
              \ of the experiment, suggesting that the presence of gut bacteria is\
              \ important in triggering overt disease in our facility. Comparable\
              \ experimental outcomes were observed in DSS-treated, germ-free mice\
              \ monocolonized with either of the health-associated bacteria, which\
              \ did not lose weight or develop intestinal pathology (Fig. 3a) nor\
              \ experienced significant mortality (Fig. 3b). In contrast, when DSS-treated\
              \ mice were monocolonized with either of the disease-associated bacteria,\
              \ we observed more rapid and greater weight loss (Fig. 3a) and significantly\
              \ reduced survival (Fig. 3b). Therefore, we identified and validated\
              \ D. muricolitica and A. okayasuensis as mouse bacteria that can promote\
              \ disease not observed in mice monocolonized with the commensal bacteria\

              \ in the intestine potentially caused by disease-associated versus health-associated\
              \ species, we next examined histology, immune cell populations and cytokine\
              \ production. The human-colonizing A. faecis and the facility-prevalent\
              \ D. muricolitica were chosen as exemplary disease- and health-associated\
              \ bacteria, respectively, for these analyses. Flow cytometric analysis\
              \ of intestinal lamina propria leukocytes isolated from germ-free mice\
              \ monocolonized for 4 weeks with either A. faecis or D. muricolitica\
              \ revealed that colonization with either strain did not significantly\
              \ impact the composition of intestinal leukocyte and lymphocyte subsets\
              \ (Extended Data Figs. 5b,c and 6). However, the perturbation and epithelial\
              \ disruption induced by DSS led to significantly increased inflammatory\
              \ CD64+CD11c+ monocytes/macrophages in the lamina propria compartment\
              \ of the large intestine in D. muricolitica monocolonized mice, but\
              \ not in A. faecis monocolonized mice (Extended Data Figs. 5c,d and\
              \ 6). These monocytes have been shown to play a pathogenic role in the\
              \ intestine in the context of Helicobacter-induced inflammation25. This\
              \ suggests that, although neither pathogenic nor immunogenic at homeostasis,\
              \ D. muricolitica drives increased inflammatory responses in the wake\
              \ of epithelial damage whereas health-associated A. faecis does not.\
              \ Importantly, while histological samples taken after 7 days of DSS\
              \ treatment from colons and caeca of D. muricolitica monocolonized mice\
              \ occasionally exhibited features of severe inflammation, this was not\
              \ statistically different from that of A. faecis monocolonized mice\
              \ (Fig. 3c,d) and did not consistently correspond to the weight loss\
              \ observed. This again suggests that weight loss in the DSS model may\
              \ not always correlate with intestinal inflammation and pathology.\\\
              n\\nTo determine whether the presence of D. muricolitica or A. faecis\
              \ had a positive or negative correlation with weight change, we next\
              \ examined 20 independent mice and assessed the relationship between\
              \ bacterial levels using quantitative PCR (qPCR) before DSS treatment\
              \ and weight change observed at day 10. This analysis identified a positive\
              \ correlation between weight change and pre-DSS A. faecis abundance\
              \ (R = 0.3679, P = 0.0046; Fig. 3e). Similarly, a negative correlation\
              \ was observed between weight change and D. muricolitica abundance (R2\
              \ = 0.3626, P = 0.0050; Fig. 3e). This independent confirmation provides\
              \ further validation of the relationship between these species and the\
              \ severity of DSS colitis; however, additional work is needed to confirm\
              \ their roles as pathobionts.\\n\\n### Global distribution and prevalence\
              \ in other mouse facilities\\n\\nBecause D. muricolitica and A. okayasuensis\
              \ affected the outcome of DSS colitis in our mouse facility, we next\
              \ explored the presence and distribution of these bacteria in other\
              \ mouse facilities around the world. To do so, we first generated a\
              \ global representation of laboratory mouse intestinal microbiomes by\
              \ curating 582 publicly available shotgun metagenome samples from ‘control’,\
              \ SPF mice. We combined this dataset with shotgun metagenomes from feces\
              \ of 40 mice at the Wellcome Sanger Institute to yield a global mouse\
              \ gut microbiome dataset covering 31 institutes across 12 countries.\
              \ We then determined the prevalence and abundance of health-associated\
              \ bacteria S. muris and A. faecis and disease-associated bacteria D.\
              \ muricolitica and A. okayasuensis in this mouse microbiome dataset.\\\
              n\\nDuncaniella muricolitica and A. okayasuensis were both dominant\
              \ members of the mouse microbiome, present in 54.5 and 47.9% of samples\
              \ and with a mean abundance of 0.52 and 0.48% reads per sample, respectively.\
              \ Importantly, D. muricolitica and A. okayasuensis were each detected\
              \ in 80.6% (25/31) of the institutes included in the analyses (Fig.\
              \ 4), and there were only three institutes that did not contain either\
              \ of these species. For comparison, among health-associated species\
              \ S. muris was the most dominant in the mouse gut microbiota, present\
              \ in 96.5% of samples with a mean abundance of 6.2% reads, while A.\
              \ faecis was a relatively minor species, present in 5.9% of samples\
              \ with a mean abundance of 0.22% reads. S. muris was present in all\
              \ (31/31) of the institutes included in the analyses, whereas A. faecis\
              \ was detected in 25.8% (8/31). The abundance of each species also differed\
              \ between institutes (Fig. 4). Thus, we show that mouse-derived bacteria\
              \ cultured from our institute are common mouse symbionts and, importantly,\
              \ D. muricolitica and A. okayasuensis are common, but not ubiquitous,\
              \ in animal facilities around the world.Fig. 4Global epidemiology and\

              n\\n## Disease severity is highly variable in the DSS mouse model\\\
              n\\nWe administered 1.5% DSS through the drinking water for 7 days to\
              \ 579 identically housed, SPF wild-type C57BL/6N mice (297 males, 282\
              \ females; median age 11 weeks; s.d. 12 days) from 14 distinct parental\
              \ lineages (that is, founder matings derived from a single breeding\
              \ pair). We observed extensive variability in experimental endpoints\
              \ in these genetically identical mice at 10 days post DSS treatment,\
              \ with histological assessment of intestinal pathology of the mid and\
              \ distal colon ranging from severe inflammation, characterized by extensive\
              \ crypt loss, leukocytic infiltration and edema, to no visible inflammation\
              \ (Fig. 1a,b). Substantial variation was also observed in the weight\
              \ change of mice treated with DSS, with the response ranging from 12%\
              \ weight gain to 30% weight loss across the cohort (Fig. 1c). Regression\
              \ analysis considering histology scores and weight loss demonstrated\
              \ limited correlation (R2 = 0.27), suggesting that weight loss and intestinal\
              \ pathology outcomes, common experimental endpoint measures in the DSS\
              \ model, may be partially independent responses to DSS (Fig. 1d). This\
              \ relationship is consistent with systemic complications contributing\
              \ to experimental endpoints in the DSS model.Fig. 1Disease severity\

              \ variable response to DSS\\n\\nTo identify the primary factors determining\
              \ disease outcome, we established a random forest classifier model incorporating\
              \ mouse sex, age, lineage, parents, mouse room and experimental date\
              \ to assess the relative importance of each of these factors (Extended\
              \ Data Fig. 1). The strongest predictive factor for weight loss and\
              \ histology score, both together and independently in these genetically\
              \ identical C57BL/6N mice maintained under standardized SPF conditions\
              \ within the same facility, was parental lineage, with correlation analysis\
              \ confirming these associations (P < 0.01, Kruskal–Wallis; Extended\
              \ Data Fig. 1).\\n\\nSince all mice were derived from the same genetic\
              \ founder stock, the most likely mediator of their DSS phenotype was\
              \ an extrinsic lineage-specific factor. However, to exclude the role\
              \ of host genetics or epigenetic differences between colonies, and to\
              \ determine whether the microbiota alone could be responsible for the\
              \ observed phenotypic variation, fecal samples were collected from SPF\
              \ mice (without DSS treatment) from parental lineages that represented\
              \ extremes of disease outcome and were used to colonize C57BL/6N germ-free\
              \ mice. These colonized recipient mice were then subjected to DSS treatment\
              \ involving daily weight measurements, with colon sections collected\
              \ and analyzed histologically 10 days after the initiation of DSS treatment.\
              \ Recipient mice exhibited both weight loss and pathology scores not\
              \ statistically different from those observed in the respective donor\
              \ mouse lineages, but differing significantly between disease- and non-associated\
              \ lineages (P = 0.0002, paired t-test; Fig. 2a). From these results\
              \ it is clear that, independent of other factors such as host genetics\
              \ or epigenetic lineage-specific factors, the microbiota is sufficient\
              \ to produce the observed variation in phenotypic response to DSS administration.Fig.\

              \ drive disease variability\\n\\nHaving established the importance of\
              \ the microbiota in mediation of phenotypic outcomes to DSS in genetically\
              \ identical mice, we next sought to understand the degree of variability\
              \ in the mouse microbiota across a single facility, and to define changes\
              \ in the microbiota that occur with DSS treatment. Fecal samples were\
              \ collected before DSS treatment and 10 days after DSS exposure, and\
              \ subjected to taxonomic profiling with 16 S ribosomal RNA amplicon\
              \ sequencing to determine microbiota community composition. Consistent\
              \ with previous reports of gastrointestinal inflammation, this analysis\
              \ demonstrated a clear separation of microbiome community between pre-\
              \ and post-DSS samples (Fig. 2b,c and Extended Data Figs. 2 and 3) and\
              \ a significant reduction in bacterial diversity (Shannon diversity\
              \ index, P = 0.0357; Fig. 2d)12. Although expansion of Proteobacteria\
              \ is often associated with gut microbiome dysbiosis, while an increase\
              \ in Proteobacteria was observed post DSS (P < 0.05, Kolmogorov–Smirnov\
              \ test), limited association was observed between weight loss and Proteobacteria\
              \ proportion either pre (Fig. 2e; Spearman correlation, 0.196) or post\
              \ DSS treatment (Fig. 2e; Spearman correlation, −0.289). This suggests\
              \ that other gut bacteria may be contributing to the observed variation\
              \ in DSS resistance and susceptibility.\\n\\nGiven the transmissibility\
              \ of disease phenotype we observed in the germ-free mouse experiments,\
              \ we reasoned that the observed phenotypic variation was primarily dependent\
              \ on baseline microbiota composition before DSS treatment. To understand\
              \ the composition of microbiota associated with increased risk of disease\
              \ outcome, we applied linear discriminant analysis to gut microbiota\
              \ composition before and after DSS exposure24. This unsupervised analysis\
              \ leveraged the variability between mouse lineage-specific bacteria\
              \ to identify the bacterial taxa that most closely predict DSS response.\
              \ Using this approach, we identified two statistically different bacterial\
              \ taxa associated with no disease, and five statistically different\
              \ bacterial taxa associated with >5% weight loss. Notably, no relationship\
              \ was observed between the occurrence or abundance of these isolates\
              \ in mice before DSS exposure, and equivalent predictive bacterial taxa\
              \ were not identified within the microbiota of mice after DSS exposure.\
              \ Our results suggest that the presence of specific gut bacterial taxa\
              \ before DSS exposure may influence disease severity and outcome, possibly\
              \ by either priming or protection from disease.\\n\\n## Isolation of\
              \ bacterial species for functional validation\\n\\nWhile we show clear\
              \ associations between specific bacterial taxa and DSS-mediated disease\
              \ outcome using 16 S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing, accurate taxonomic\
              \ identification to strain level and experimental validation require\
              \ the isolation and genome sequencing of pure clonal cultures of bacterial\
              \ strains. To target and purify bacterial strains, we next performed\
              \ broad-based culture of ~2,000 bacterial colonies from mouse fecal\
              \ samples. The resulting isolates were identified by capillary 16 S\
              \ rRNA gene sequencing and included four previously identified bacterial\
              \ taxa, two ‘disease associated’ and two ‘health associated’. These\
              \ isolates were subjected to whole-genome sequencing and genomic analysis\
              \ to aid in precise taxonomic and phylogenetic assignment (Extended\
              \ Data Fig. 4). In addition, we performed extensive phenotypic characterization\
              \ and comparative genome analyses of these four species (Methods) as\
              \ a basis to provisionally name the health-associated bacteria Anaerostipes\
              \ faecis and Sangeribacter muris and the disease-associated bacteria\
              \ Duncaniella muricolitica and Alistipes okayasuensis; of note, the\
              \ last three species are mouse specific. Examination of the relative\
              \ abundance of each of these species before DSS treatment identified\
              \ significantly higher levels of A. faecis (P = 0264, t-test) and S.\
              \ muris (P = 0.0010, t-test) in those mice without weight loss, and\
              \ significantly higher levels of D. muricolitica (P = 0.0351, t-test)\
              \ and A. okayasuensis (P = 0.0006, t-test) in mice that experienced\
              \ >5% weight loss (Fig. 2f).\\n\\nWe next repeated the DSS experimental\
              \ model in either germ-free mice or germ-free mice stably monocolonized\
              \ for 4 weeks with one of these four bacterial strains (Extended Data\
              \ Figs. 5a and 6). Control germ-free mice treated with DSS neither lost\
              \ weight (Fig. 3a) nor experienced mortality (Fig. 3b) over the course\
              \ of the experiment, suggesting that the presence of gut bacteria is\
              \ important in triggering overt disease in our facility. Comparable\
              \ experimental outcomes were observed in DSS-treated, germ-free mice\
              \ monocolonized with either of the health-associated bacteria, which\
              \ did not lose weight or develop intestinal pathology (Fig. 3a) nor\
              \ experienced significant mortality (Fig. 3b). In contrast, when DSS-treated\
              \ mice were monocolonized with either of the disease-associated bacteria,\
              \ we observed more rapid and greater weight loss (Fig. 3a) and significantly\
              \ reduced survival (Fig. 3b). Therefore, we identified and validated\
              \ D. muricolitica and A. okayasuensis as mouse bacteria that can promote\
              \ disease not observed in mice monocolonized with the commensal bacteria\

              \ in the intestine potentially caused by disease-associated versus health-associated\
              \ species, we next examined histology, immune cell populations and cytokine\
              \ production. The human-colonizing A. faecis and the facility-prevalent\
              \ D. muricolitica were chosen as exemplary disease- and health-associated\
              \ bacteria, respectively, for these analyses. Flow cytometric analysis\
              \ of intestinal lamina propria leukocytes isolated from germ-free mice\
              \ monocolonized for 4 weeks with either A. faecis or D. muricolitica\
              \ revealed that colonization with either strain did not significantly\
              \ impact the composition of intestinal leukocyte and lymphocyte subsets\
              \ (Extended Data Figs. 5b,c and 6). However, the perturbation and epithelial\
              \ disruption induced by DSS led to significantly increased inflammatory\
              \ CD64+CD11c+ monocytes/macrophages in the lamina propria compartment\
              \ of the large intestine in D. muricolitica monocolonized mice, but\
              \ not in A. faecis monocolonized mice (Extended Data Figs. 5c,d and\
              \ 6). These monocytes have been shown to play a pathogenic role in the\
              \ intestine in the context of Helicobacter-induced inflammation25. This\
              \ suggests that, although neither pathogenic nor immunogenic at homeostasis,\
              \ D. muricolitica drives increased inflammatory responses in the wake\
              \ of epithelial damage whereas health-associated A. faecis does not.\
              \ Importantly, while histological samples taken after 7 days of DSS\
              \ treatment from colons and caeca of D. muricolitica monocolonized mice\
              \ occasionally exhibited features of severe inflammation, this was not\
              \ statistically different from that of A. faecis monocolonized mice\
              \ (Fig. 3c,d) and did not consistently correspond to the weight loss\
              \ observed. This again suggests that weight loss in the DSS model may\
              \ not always correlate with intestinal inflammation and pathology.\\\
              n\\nTo determine whether the presence of D. muricolitica or A. faecis\
              \ had a positive or negative correlation with weight change, we next\
              \ examined 20 independent mice and assessed the relationship between\
              \ bacterial levels using quantitative PCR (qPCR) before DSS treatment\
              \ and weight change observed at day 10. This analysis identified a positive\
              \ correlation between weight change and pre-DSS A. faecis abundance\
              \ (R = 0.3679, P = 0.0046; Fig. 3e). Similarly, a negative correlation\
              \ was observed between weight change and D. muricolitica abundance (R2\
              \ = 0.3626, P = 0.0050; Fig. 3e). This independent confirmation provides\
              \ further validation of the relationship between these species and the\
              \ severity of DSS colitis; however, additional work is needed to confirm\
              \ their roles as pathobionts.\\n\\n## Global distribution and prevalence\
              \ in other mouse facilities\\n\\nBecause D. muricolitica and A. okayasuensis\
              \ affected the outcome of DSS colitis in our mouse facility, we next\
              \ explored the presence and distribution of these bacteria in other\
              \ mouse facilities around the world. To do so, we first generated a\
              \ global representation of laboratory mouse intestinal microbiomes by\
              \ curating 582 publicly available shotgun metagenome samples from ‘control’,\
              \ SPF mice. We combined this dataset with shotgun metagenomes from feces\
              \ of 40 mice at the Wellcome Sanger Institute to yield a global mouse\
              \ gut microbiome dataset covering 31 institutes across 12 countries.\
              \ We then determined the prevalence and abundance of health-associated\
              \ bacteria S. muris and A. faecis and disease-associated bacteria D.\
              \ muricolitica and A. okayasuensis in this mouse microbiome dataset.\\\
              n\\nDuncaniella muricolitica and A. okayasuensis were both dominant\
              \ members of the mouse microbiome, present in 54.5 and 47.9% of samples\
              \ and with a mean abundance of 0.52 and 0.48% reads per sample, respectively.\
              \ Importantly, D. muricolitica and A. okayasuensis were each detected\
              \ in 80.6% (25/31) of the institutes included in the analyses (Fig.\
              \ 4), and there were only three institutes that did not contain either\
              \ of these species. For comparison, among health-associated species\
              \ S. muris was the most dominant in the mouse gut microbiota, present\
              \ in 96.5% of samples with a mean abundance of 6.2% reads, while A.\
              \ faecis was a relatively minor species, present in 5.9% of samples\
              \ with a mean abundance of 0.22% reads. S. muris was present in all\
              \ (31/31) of the institutes included in the analyses, whereas A. faecis\
              \ was detected in 25.8% (8/31). The abundance of each species also differed\
              \ between institutes (Fig. 4). Thus, we show that mouse-derived bacteria\
              \ cultured from our institute are common mouse symbionts and, importantly,\
              \ D. muricolitica and A. okayasuensis are common, but not ubiquitous,\
              \ in animal facilities around the world.Fig. 4Global epidemiology and\

              n\\n## Discussion\\n\\nDespite experimental variability in the DSS mouse\
              \ model, which limits the interpretation and translation of data, the\
              \ model is increasingly used in basic research (>6,000 DSS model publications\
              \ on PubMed) and by the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries.\
              \ Cohousing, heterozygote mating and other experimental procedures have\
              \ been used in an attempt to normalize the microbiota within experiments\
              \ and ensure direct measures of the effects of mouse genetic background\
              \ on disease phenotype rather than indirect and unknown microbiota-associated\
              \ effects26. In our approach we leveraged this variability in DSS outcome,\
              \ in combination with microbiome analysis, machine learning, anerobic\
              \ culturing and germ-free mouse validation experiments, to gain relevant\
              \ biological insight into microbiota determinants of DSS disease. While\
              \ this consideration of the microbiome did not completely eliminate\
              \ the impact of multidimensionality in the DSS model, we identified\
              \ and undertook experimental validation of D. muricolitica and A. okayasuensis,\
              \ both of which have a dominant effect on DSS outcome.\\n\\nInterestingly,\
              \ D. muricolitica and A. okayasuensis are phylogenetically distinct\
              \ from each other and neither had computationally predicted virulence\
              \ factors within their genome. While it remains unclear how these isolates\
              \ contribute to DSS disease, both exhibit a potential for polysaccharide\
              \ utilization that may mediate this relationship through interaction\
              \ with the mucus layer. We also noted that weight loss and intestinal\
              \ pathology do not always correlate, so they should not necessarily\
              \ be used as surrogates for each other. Similarly, substantial weight\
              \ loss was observed in monocolonized mice even in the absence of severe\
              \ inflammation, suggesting that activation of key pathways alone can\
              \ have a substantial impact on experimental outcome. Together, these\
              \ insights raise the need for further experimental study of host interactions\
              \ and the biology of these important mouse-specific bacteria.\\n\\nWe\
              \ propose that researchers should consider monitoring for D. muricolitica\
              \ and A. okayasuensis in their mouse facilities, as is undertaken for\
              \ other immunophenotyped-affecting microbes such as segmented filamentous\
              \ bacteria27. In some cases, precolonization of animals with these bacteria,\
              \ if they are not present in the facility, may yield better experimental\
              \ control and increase confidence in this important and widely used\
              \ mouse model of human disease. Overall, our work suggests that the\
              \ application of metagenomics techniques to report microbiota composition,\
              \ in addition to the genetic and disease phenotypes being described,\
              \ should represent a standard minimum requirement for the DSS mouse\
              \ model. We have deposited the D. muricolitis, A. okayasuensis, S. muris\
              \ and A. faecis strains and genomes in public repositories to support\
              \ this work.\\n\\n## Methods\\n\\n### Mouse models\\n\\nMice were maintained\
              \ under either germ-free or SPF conditions at the Wellcome Sanger Institute\
              \ Home Office-approved facility, with all procedures carried out in\
              \ accordance with the United Kingdom Animals (Scientific Procedures)\
              \ Act of 1986 under Home Office approval (PPL no. 80/2643). Germ-free\
              \ mice were maintained in positive-pressure isolators (Bell), with feces\
              \ tested by culture, microscopy and PCR to ensure sterility. Consumables\
              \ were autoclaved at 121 °C for 15 min before introduction into the\
              \ isolators. For experimentation, cages were opened in a vaporized hydrogen\
              \ peroxide-sterilized, class II cabinet (Bioquell), with fecal transplant\
              \ and monocolonized gnotobiotic lines generated by weekly oral gavage\
              \ over a 3-week period. Materials were prepared in Dulbecco’s PBS at\
              \ 100 mg ml–1 immediately before administration under anaerobic conditions\
              \ (10% H, 10% CO2, 80% N) in a Whitley DG250 workstation at 37 °C (ref.\
              \ 8). Mice were maintained in sterile ISOcages (Tecniplast) and housed\
              \ on ISOrack for the period of the experiment.\\n\\n### DSS colitis\
              \ challenge\\n\\nDextran sulphate sodium was administered at a concentration\
              \ of 1.5% (w/v) (Affymetrix, Inc., average molecular weight 44 kDa)\
              \ in drinking water for 7 days, followed by 3 days with regular drinking\
              \ water, to C57BL6/6N mice aged 7–16 weeks (297 male, 282 female; median\
              \ age 11 weeks; s.d. 12 days). Mice were weighed every day and culled\
              \ if weight loss reached 20% of starting weight. Average weight loss\
              \ curves were censored for each group when the first member of the group\
              \ reached this endpoint, to avoid misleading calculations of the average\
              \ using the remaining members. No statistical methods were used to predetermine\
              \ sample sizes in these experiments.\\n\\n### Histological assessment\
              \ of intestinal inflammation\\n\\nDextran sulphate sodium-treated SPF\
              \ mice were sacrificed at day 10 by cervical dislocation, and samples\
              \ from mid and distal colon taken. Tissue sections were fixed in buffered\
              \ 10% formalin, paraffin embedded, cut and stained with hematoxylin\
              \ and eosin (H&E). Colon histopathology was blind-graded semiquantitatively,\
              \ on a scale from zero to three, for four criteria: (1) degree of epithelial\
              \ hyperplasia/damage and goblet cell depletion; (2) leukocyte infiltration\
              \ in lamina propria; (3) area of tissue affected; and (4) presence of\
              \ markers of severe inflammation, including crypt abscesses, submucosal\
              \ inflammation and edema. Scores for individual criteria were added\
              \ for an overall inflammation score of between zero and 12 for each\
              \ sample. Scores from mid and distal colon were then averaged to obtain\
              \ inflammation scores for each mouse colon.\\n\\nMonocolonized, germ-free\
              \ mice were euthanized 7 days after DSS administration and samples taken\
              \ from the cecum and midcolon. Tissue sections were fixed in methacarn,\
              \ paraffin embedded, sectioned and stained with H&E. Colon and cecum\
              \ histopathology was graded on a semiquantitative scale by a pathologist\
              \ blinded to the groups. The criteria scored were (1) degree of epithelial\
              \ hyperplasia/damage and goblet cell depletion; (2) severity of leukocyte\
              \ infiltration in lamina propria; (3) extent of inflammation; and (4)\
              \ presence of markers of severe inflammation, including crypt abscesses,\
              \ submucosal inflammation and edema. Each criterion was scored on a\
              \ scale of zero to three based on previously described thresholds28\
              \ and the sum of the individual scores was recorded as an indication\
              \ of overall inflammation. For all animal experiments, treatments were\
              \ randomized by cage by researchers blinded to treatment conditions.\
              \ For statistical analysis, distribution was assumed to be normal but\
              \ this was not formally tested\\n\\n### Bacterial culture\\n\\nFecal\
              \ samples and bacterial isolates were cultured for anaerobic gastrointestinal\

        n\\nExperimental mouse models are central to basic biomedical research; however,\
        \ variability exists across genetically identical mice and mouse facilities\
        \ making comparisons difficult. Whether specific indigenous gut bacteria drive\
        \ immunophenotypic variability in mouse models of human disease remains poorly\
        \ understood. We performed a large-scale experiment using 579 genetically\
        \ identical laboratory mice from a single animal facility, designed to identify\
        \ the causes of disease variability in the widely used dextran sulphate sodium\
        \ mouse model of inflammatory bowel disease. Commonly used treatment endpoint\
        \ measures—weight loss and intestinal pathology—showed limited correlation\
        \ and varied across mouse lineages. Analysis of the gut microbiome, coupled\
        \ with machine learning and targeted anaerobic culturing, identified and isolated\
        \ two previously undescribed species, Duncaniella muricolitica and Alistipes\
        \ okayasuensis, and demonstrated that they exert dominant effects in the dextran\
        \ sulphate sodium model leading to variable treatment endpoint measures. We\
        \ show that the identified gut microbial species are common, but not ubiquitous,\
        \ in mouse facilities around the world, and suggest that researchers monitor\
        \ for these species to provide experimental design opportunities for improved\
        \ mouse models of human intestinal diseases.\\n\\n## Main\\n\\nExperimental\
        \ mouse models are central to basic biomedical research and serve as important\
        \ preclinical models in drug discovery for a variety of human diseases, including\
        \ autoimmune and metabolic disorders, cancers and infections. Unfortunately,\
        \ there is tremendous variability in disease penetrance and reproducibility\
        \ among genetically identical mice within and between mouse facilities, limiting\
        \ the utility of many commonly used models1–3. Specific-pathogen-free (SPF)\
        \ protocols have been successfully employed to control the confounding effects\
        \ that can be caused by known bacterial pathogens, but we lack equivalent\
        \ knowledge of the effects of the diverse, uncharacterized symbiotic bacteria\
        \ within the indigenous gut microbiota of mice. While our knowledge of the\
        \ human gut microbiota in health and disease has expanded extensively with\
        \ large-scale microbiome studies, comprehensive computational bacterial discovery4,5\
        \ and extensive genome-sequenced bacterial collections6–9, equivalent investigations\
        \ in mouse models have remained limited. The vast differences in species type,\
        \ composition and dispersal between human and mouse microbiotas highlight\
        \ the importance of efforts to culture mouse-specific bacteria and to validate\
        \ their functions during intestinal homeostasis and disease10,11.\\n\\nInflammatory\
        \ bowel disease (IBD) research relies heavily on laboratory mice to understand\
        \ colitis and the role of host genetics in disease resistance and susceptibility.\
        \ Detailed immune characterization shows colitis induction with specific microbial\
        \ communities12 or species colonization with Helicobacter spp.13,14, Enterobacteriaceae15,\
        \ Bilophila wadsworthia16 or segmented filamentous bacteria17. Potential genetic\
        \ modulators of IBD are routinely assessed through administration of dextran\
        \ sulphate sodium (DSS) at various concentrations in drinking water, which\
        \ acts by damaging the gut epithelial barrier to trigger inflammatory disease12,13.\
        \ In germ-free mice, immune-mediated colitis is largely absent although reduced\
        \ barrier function can introduce susceptibility at higher DSS concentrations18.\
        \ Similarly, dietary changes in both germ-free and SPF mice can determine\
        \ DSS susceptibility in a microbiome-dependent and -independent manner19,\
        \ and highly specific protection is provided by the presence of Clostridium\
        \ immunis20–23. Despite these advances, the gut microbiota in these mouse\
        \ models, including standard SPF models, is rarely profiled at the genomic\
        \ level or cultured in the laboratory, nor robustly controlled to understand\
        \ the contribution of general gut bacteria to experimental outcomes.\\n\\\
        nTo quantify the variability of the widely used DSS model of IBD and to investigate\
        \ primary factors contributing to this variability, we undertook a large-scale\
        \ experiment using 579 genetically identical laboratory mice in a single animal\
        \ facility. Incorporating standardized phenotyping, microbiome analysis and\
        \ metadata collection, this approach was designed to identify and validate\
        \ the causes of variability for standard experimental endpoints (weight loss\
        \ and intestinal pathology). Using a data-driven approach we identified, from\
        \ gut microbiome data, candidate bacterial taxa driving weight loss and intestinal\
        \ inflammation. Functional validation with cultured isolates suggests that\
        \ these specific bacterial strains can determine experimental outcomes in\
        \ gnotobiotic mice. Thus, using an experimental approach for microbiome discovery,\
        \ we identified the previously undescribed mouse gut bacteria Duncaniella\
        \ muricolitica and Alistipes okayasuensis, found frequently in mouse colonies\
        \ around the world, that impact outcomes in the DSS model of colitis and may\
        \ be acting as pathobionts.\\n\\n## Results\\n\\n### Disease severity is highly\
        \ variable in the DSS mouse model\\n\\nWe administered 1.5% DSS through the\
        \ drinking water for 7 days to 579 identically housed, SPF wild-type C57BL/6N\
        \ mice (297 males, 282 females; median age 11 weeks; s.d. 12 days) from 14\
        \ distinct parental lineages (that is, founder matings derived from a single\
        \ breeding pair). We observed extensive variability in experimental endpoints\
        \ in these genetically identical mice at 10 days post DSS treatment, with\
        \ histological assessment of intestinal pathology of the mid and distal colon\
        \ ranging from severe inflammation, characterized by extensive crypt loss,\
        \ leukocytic infiltration and edema, to no visible inflammation (Fig. 1a,b).\
        \ Substantial variation was also observed in the weight change of mice treated\
        \ with DSS, with the response ranging from 12% weight gain to 30% weight loss\
        \ across the cohort (Fig. 1c). Regression analysis considering histology scores\
        \ and weight loss demonstrated limited correlation (R2 = 0.27), suggesting\
        \ that weight loss and intestinal pathology outcomes, common experimental\
        \ endpoint measures in the DSS model, may be partially independent responses\
        \ to DSS (Fig. 1d). This relationship is consistent with systemic complications\
        \ contributing to experimental endpoints in the DSS model.Fig. 1Disease severity\
        \ is highly variable in the DSS mouse model.a, Representative images of extremes\
        \ of midcolon inflammatory response in wild-type C57/BL6 mice after treatment\

        \ exposed to DSS treatment. d, Relationship between weight change and histology\
        \ scores across all 579 mice. R2 = 0.273.\\n\\n### Gut microbiota is major\
        \ driver of variable response to DSS\\n\\nTo identify the primary factors\
        \ determining disease outcome, we established a random forest classifier model\
        \ incorporating mouse sex, age, lineage, parents, mouse room and experimental\
        \ date to assess the relative importance of each of these factors (Extended\
        \ Data Fig. 1). The strongest predictive factor for weight loss and histology\
        \ score, both together and independently in these genetically identical C57BL/6N\
        \ mice maintained under standardized SPF conditions within the same facility,\
        \ was parental lineage, with correlation analysis confirming these associations\
        \ (P < 0.01, Kruskal–Wallis; Extended Data Fig. 1).\\n\\nSince all mice were\
        \ derived from the same genetic founder stock, the most likely mediator of\
        \ their DSS phenotype was an extrinsic lineage-specific factor. However, to\
        \ exclude the role of host genetics or epigenetic differences between colonies,\
        \ and to determine whether the microbiota alone could be responsible for the\
        \ observed phenotypic variation, fecal samples were collected from SPF mice\
        \ (without DSS treatment) from parental lineages that represented extremes\
        \ of disease outcome and were used to colonize C57BL/6N germ-free mice. These\
        \ colonized recipient mice were then subjected to DSS treatment involving\
        \ daily weight measurements, with colon sections collected and analyzed histologically\
        \ 10 days after the initiation of DSS treatment. Recipient mice exhibited\
        \ both weight loss and pathology scores not statistically different from those\
        \ observed in the respective donor mouse lineages, but differing significantly\
        \ between disease- and non-associated lineages (P = 0.0002, paired t-test;\
        \ Fig. 2a). From these results it is clear that, independent of other factors\
        \ such as host genetics or epigenetic lineage-specific factors, the microbiota\
        \ is sufficient to produce the observed variation in phenotypic response to\
        \ DSS administration.Fig. 2Discovery of candidate bacterial taxa associated\

        \ data\\n\\n### Discovery of bacteria that drive disease variability\\n\\\
        nHaving established the importance of the microbiota in mediation of phenotypic\
        \ outcomes to DSS in genetically identical mice, we next sought to understand\
        \ the degree of variability in the mouse microbiota across a single facility,\
        \ and to define changes in the microbiota that occur with DSS treatment. Fecal\
        \ samples were collected before DSS treatment and 10 days after DSS exposure,\
        \ and subjected to taxonomic profiling with 16 S ribosomal RNA amplicon sequencing\
        \ to determine microbiota community composition. Consistent with previous\
        \ reports of gastrointestinal inflammation, this analysis demonstrated a clear\
        \ separation of microbiome community between pre- and post-DSS samples (Fig.\
        \ 2b,c and Extended Data Figs. 2 and 3) and a significant reduction in bacterial\
        \ diversity (Shannon diversity index, P = 0.0357; Fig. 2d)12. Although expansion\
        \ of Proteobacteria is often associated with gut microbiome dysbiosis, while\
        \ an increase in Proteobacteria was observed post DSS (P < 0.05, Kolmogorov–Smirnov\
        \ test), limited association was observed between weight loss and Proteobacteria\
        \ proportion either pre (Fig. 2e; Spearman correlation, 0.196) or post DSS\
        \ treatment (Fig. 2e; Spearman correlation, −0.289). This suggests that other\
        \ gut bacteria may be contributing to the observed variation in DSS resistance\
        \ and susceptibility.\\n\\nGiven the transmissibility of disease phenotype\
        \ we observed in the germ-free mouse experiments, we reasoned that the observed\
        \ phenotypic variation was primarily dependent on baseline microbiota composition\
        \ before DSS treatment. To understand the composition of microbiota associated\
        \ with increased risk of disease outcome, we applied linear discriminant analysis\
        \ to gut microbiota composition before and after DSS exposure24. This unsupervised\
        \ analysis leveraged the variability between mouse lineage-specific bacteria\
        \ to identify the bacterial taxa that most closely predict DSS response. Using\
        \ this approach, we identified two statistically different bacterial taxa\
        \ associated with no disease, and five statistically different bacterial taxa\
        \ associated with >5% weight loss. Notably, no relationship was observed between\
        \ the occurrence or abundance of these isolates in mice before DSS exposure,\
        \ and equivalent predictive bacterial taxa were not identified within the\
        \ microbiota of mice after DSS exposure. Our results suggest that the presence\
        \ of specific gut bacterial taxa before DSS exposure may influence disease\
        \ severity and outcome, possibly by either priming or protection from disease.\\\
        n\\n### Isolation of bacterial species for functional validation\\n\\nWhile\
        \ we show clear associations between specific bacterial taxa and DSS-mediated\
        \ disease outcome using 16 S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing, accurate taxonomic\
        \ identification to strain level and experimental validation require the isolation\
        \ and genome sequencing of pure clonal cultures of bacterial strains. To target\
        \ and purify bacterial strains, we next performed broad-based culture of ~2,000\
        \ bacterial colonies from mouse fecal samples. The resulting isolates were\
        \ identified by capillary 16 S rRNA gene sequencing and included four previously\
        \ identified bacterial taxa, two ‘disease associated’ and two ‘health associated’.\
        \ These isolates were subjected to whole-genome sequencing and genomic analysis\
        \ to aid in precise taxonomic and phylogenetic assignment (Extended Data Fig.\
        \ 4). In addition, we performed extensive phenotypic characterization and\
        \ comparative genome analyses of these four species (Methods) as a basis to\
        \ provisionally name the health-associated bacteria Anaerostipes faecis and\
        \ Sangeribacter muris and the disease-associated bacteria Duncaniella muricolitica\
        \ and Alistipes okayasuensis; of note, the last three species are mouse specific.\
        \ Examination of the relative abundance of each of these species before DSS\
        \ treatment identified significantly higher levels of A. faecis (P = 0264,\
        \ t-test) and S. muris (P = 0.0010, t-test) in those mice without weight loss,\
        \ and significantly higher levels of D. muricolitica (P = 0.0351, t-test)\
        \ and A. okayasuensis (P = 0.0006, t-test) in mice that experienced >5% weight\
        \ loss (Fig. 2f).\\n\\nWe next repeated the DSS experimental model in either\
        \ germ-free mice or germ-free mice stably monocolonized for 4 weeks with one\
        \ of these four bacterial strains (Extended Data Figs. 5a and 6). Control\
        \ germ-free mice treated with DSS neither lost weight (Fig. 3a) nor experienced\
        \ mortality (Fig. 3b) over the course of the experiment, suggesting that the\
        \ presence of gut bacteria is important in triggering overt disease in our\
        \ facility. Comparable experimental outcomes were observed in DSS-treated,\
        \ germ-free mice monocolonized with either of the health-associated bacteria,\
        \ which did not lose weight or develop intestinal pathology (Fig. 3a) nor\
        \ experienced significant mortality (Fig. 3b). In contrast, when DSS-treated\
        \ mice were monocolonized with either of the disease-associated bacteria,\
        \ we observed more rapid and greater weight loss (Fig. 3a) and significantly\
        \ reduced survival (Fig. 3b). Therefore, we identified and validated D. muricolitica\
        \ and A. okayasuensis as mouse bacteria that can promote disease not observed\
        \ in mice monocolonized with the commensal bacteria S. muris and A. faecis.Fig.\

        \ in the intestine potentially caused by disease-associated versus health-associated\
        \ species, we next examined histology, immune cell populations and cytokine\
        \ production. The human-colonizing A. faecis and the facility-prevalent D.\
        \ muricolitica were chosen as exemplary disease- and health-associated bacteria,\
        \ respectively, for these analyses. Flow cytometric analysis of intestinal\
        \ lamina propria leukocytes isolated from germ-free mice monocolonized for\
        \ 4 weeks with either A. faecis or D. muricolitica revealed that colonization\
        \ with either strain did not significantly impact the composition of intestinal\
        \ leukocyte and lymphocyte subsets (Extended Data Figs. 5b,c and 6). However,\
        \ the perturbation and epithelial disruption induced by DSS led to significantly\
        \ increased inflammatory CD64+CD11c+ monocytes/macrophages in the lamina propria\
        \ compartment of the large intestine in D. muricolitica monocolonized mice,\
        \ but not in A. faecis monocolonized mice (Extended Data Figs. 5c,d and 6).\
        \ These monocytes have been shown to play a pathogenic role in the intestine\
        \ in the context of Helicobacter-induced inflammation25. This suggests that,\
        \ although neither pathogenic nor immunogenic at homeostasis, D. muricolitica\
        \ drives increased inflammatory responses in the wake of epithelial damage\
        \ whereas health-associated A. faecis does not. Importantly, while histological\
        \ samples taken after 7 days of DSS treatment from colons and caeca of D.\
        \ muricolitica monocolonized mice occasionally exhibited features of severe\
        \ inflammation, this was not statistically different from that of A. faecis\
        \ monocolonized mice (Fig. 3c,d) and did not consistently correspond to the\
        \ weight loss observed. This again suggests that weight loss in the DSS model\
        \ may not always correlate with intestinal inflammation and pathology.\\n\\\
        nTo determine whether the presence of D. muricolitica or A. faecis had a positive\
        \ or negative correlation with weight change, we next examined 20 independent\
        \ mice and assessed the relationship between bacterial levels using quantitative\
        \ PCR (qPCR) before DSS treatment and weight change observed at day 10. This\
        \ analysis identified a positive correlation between weight change and pre-DSS\
        \ A. faecis abundance (R = 0.3679, P = 0.0046; Fig. 3e). Similarly, a negative\
        \ correlation was observed between weight change and D. muricolitica abundance\
        \ (R2 = 0.3626, P = 0.0050; Fig. 3e). This independent confirmation provides\
        \ further validation of the relationship between these species and the severity\
        \ of DSS colitis; however, additional work is needed to confirm their roles\
        \ as pathobionts.\\n\\n### Global distribution and prevalence in other mouse\
        \ facilities\\n\\nBecause D. muricolitica and A. okayasuensis affected the\
        \ outcome of DSS colitis in our mouse facility, we next explored the presence\
        \ and distribution of these bacteria in other mouse facilities around the\
        \ world. To do so, we first generated a global representation of laboratory\
        \ mouse intestinal microbiomes by curating 582 publicly available shotgun\
        \ metagenome samples from ‘control’, SPF mice. We combined this dataset with\
        \ shotgun metagenomes from feces of 40 mice at the Wellcome Sanger Institute\
        \ to yield a global mouse gut microbiome dataset covering 31 institutes across\
        \ 12 countries. We then determined the prevalence and abundance of health-associated\
        \ bacteria S. muris and A. faecis and disease-associated bacteria D. muricolitica\
        \ and A. okayasuensis in this mouse microbiome dataset.\\n\\nDuncaniella muricolitica\
        \ and A. okayasuensis were both dominant members of the mouse microbiome,\
        \ present in 54.5 and 47.9% of samples and with a mean abundance of 0.52 and\
        \ 0.48% reads per sample, respectively. Importantly, D. muricolitica and A.\
        \ okayasuensis were each detected in 80.6% (25/31) of the institutes included\
        \ in the analyses (Fig. 4), and there were only three institutes that did\
        \ not contain either of these species. For comparison, among health-associated\
        \ species S. muris was the most dominant in the mouse gut microbiota, present\
        \ in 96.5% of samples with a mean abundance of 6.2% reads, while A. faecis\
        \ was a relatively minor species, present in 5.9% of samples with a mean abundance\
        \ of 0.22% reads. S. muris was present in all (31/31) of the institutes included\
        \ in the analyses, whereas A. faecis was detected in 25.8% (8/31). The abundance\
        \ of each species also differed between institutes (Fig. 4). Thus, we show\
        \ that mouse-derived bacteria cultured from our institute are common mouse\
        \ symbionts and, importantly, D. muricolitica and A. okayasuensis are common,\
        \ but not ubiquitous, in animal facilities around the world.Fig. 4Global epidemiology\

        \ administered 1.5% DSS through the drinking water for 7 days to 579 identically\
        \ housed, SPF wild-type C57BL/6N mice (297 males, 282 females; median age\
        \ 11 weeks; s.d. 12 days) from 14 distinct parental lineages (that is, founder\
        \ matings derived from a single breeding pair). We observed extensive variability\
        \ in experimental endpoints in these genetically identical mice at 10 days\
        \ post DSS treatment, with histological assessment of intestinal pathology\
        \ of the mid and distal colon ranging from severe inflammation, characterized\
        \ by extensive crypt loss, leukocytic infiltration and edema, to no visible\
        \ inflammation (Fig. 1a,b). Substantial variation was also observed in the\
        \ weight change of mice treated with DSS, with the response ranging from 12%\
        \ weight gain to 30% weight loss across the cohort (Fig. 1c). Regression analysis\
        \ considering histology scores and weight loss demonstrated limited correlation\
        \ (R2 = 0.27), suggesting that weight loss and intestinal pathology outcomes,\
        \ common experimental endpoint measures in the DSS model, may be partially\
        \ independent responses to DSS (Fig. 1d). This relationship is consistent\
        \ with systemic complications contributing to experimental endpoints in the\
        \ DSS model.Fig. 1Disease severity is highly variable in the DSS mouse model.a,\

        \ to DSS\\n\\nTo identify the primary factors determining disease outcome,\
        \ we established a random forest classifier model incorporating mouse sex,\
        \ age, lineage, parents, mouse room and experimental date to assess the relative\
        \ importance of each of these factors (Extended Data Fig. 1). The strongest\
        \ predictive factor for weight loss and histology score, both together and\
        \ independently in these genetically identical C57BL/6N mice maintained under\
        \ standardized SPF conditions within the same facility, was parental lineage,\
        \ with correlation analysis confirming these associations (P < 0.01, Kruskal–Wallis;\
        \ Extended Data Fig. 1).\\n\\nSince all mice were derived from the same genetic\
        \ founder stock, the most likely mediator of their DSS phenotype was an extrinsic\
        \ lineage-specific factor. However, to exclude the role of host genetics or\
        \ epigenetic differences between colonies, and to determine whether the microbiota\
        \ alone could be responsible for the observed phenotypic variation, fecal\
        \ samples were collected from SPF mice (without DSS treatment) from parental\
        \ lineages that represented extremes of disease outcome and were used to colonize\
        \ C57BL/6N germ-free mice. These colonized recipient mice were then subjected\
        \ to DSS treatment involving daily weight measurements, with colon sections\
        \ collected and analyzed histologically 10 days after the initiation of DSS\
        \ treatment. Recipient mice exhibited both weight loss and pathology scores\
        \ not statistically different from those observed in the respective donor\
        \ mouse lineages, but differing significantly between disease- and non-associated\
        \ lineages (P = 0.0002, paired t-test; Fig. 2a). From these results it is\
        \ clear that, independent of other factors such as host genetics or epigenetic\
        \ lineage-specific factors, the microbiota is sufficient to produce the observed\
        \ variation in phenotypic response to DSS administration.Fig. 2Discovery of\

        n\\nHaving established the importance of the microbiota in mediation of phenotypic\
        \ outcomes to DSS in genetically identical mice, we next sought to understand\
        \ the degree of variability in the mouse microbiota across a single facility,\
        \ and to define changes in the microbiota that occur with DSS treatment. Fecal\
        \ samples were collected before DSS treatment and 10 days after DSS exposure,\
        \ and subjected to taxonomic profiling with 16 S ribosomal RNA amplicon sequencing\
        \ to determine microbiota community composition. Consistent with previous\
        \ reports of gastrointestinal inflammation, this analysis demonstrated a clear\
        \ separation of microbiome community between pre- and post-DSS samples (Fig.\
        \ 2b,c and Extended Data Figs. 2 and 3) and a significant reduction in bacterial\
        \ diversity (Shannon diversity index, P = 0.0357; Fig. 2d)12. Although expansion\
        \ of Proteobacteria is often associated with gut microbiome dysbiosis, while\
        \ an increase in Proteobacteria was observed post DSS (P < 0.05, Kolmogorov–Smirnov\
        \ test), limited association was observed between weight loss and Proteobacteria\
        \ proportion either pre (Fig. 2e; Spearman correlation, 0.196) or post DSS\
        \ treatment (Fig. 2e; Spearman correlation, −0.289). This suggests that other\
        \ gut bacteria may be contributing to the observed variation in DSS resistance\
        \ and susceptibility.\\n\\nGiven the transmissibility of disease phenotype\
        \ we observed in the germ-free mouse experiments, we reasoned that the observed\
        \ phenotypic variation was primarily dependent on baseline microbiota composition\
        \ before DSS treatment. To understand the composition of microbiota associated\
        \ with increased risk of disease outcome, we applied linear discriminant analysis\
        \ to gut microbiota composition before and after DSS exposure24. This unsupervised\
        \ analysis leveraged the variability between mouse lineage-specific bacteria\
        \ to identify the bacterial taxa that most closely predict DSS response. Using\
        \ this approach, we identified two statistically different bacterial taxa\
        \ associated with no disease, and five statistically different bacterial taxa\
        \ associated with >5% weight loss. Notably, no relationship was observed between\
        \ the occurrence or abundance of these isolates in mice before DSS exposure,\
        \ and equivalent predictive bacterial taxa were not identified within the\
        \ microbiota of mice after DSS exposure. Our results suggest that the presence\
        \ of specific gut bacterial taxa before DSS exposure may influence disease\
        \ severity and outcome, possibly by either priming or protection from disease.\\\
        n\\n## Isolation of bacterial species for functional validation\\n\\nWhile\
        \ we show clear associations between specific bacterial taxa and DSS-mediated\
        \ disease outcome using 16 S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing, accurate taxonomic\
        \ identification to strain level and experimental validation require the isolation\
        \ and genome sequencing of pure clonal cultures of bacterial strains. To target\
        \ and purify bacterial strains, we next performed broad-based culture of ~2,000\
        \ bacterial colonies from mouse fecal samples. The resulting isolates were\
        \ identified by capillary 16 S rRNA gene sequencing and included four previously\
        \ identified bacterial taxa, two ‘disease associated’ and two ‘health associated’.\
        \ These isolates were subjected to whole-genome sequencing and genomic analysis\
        \ to aid in precise taxonomic and phylogenetic assignment (Extended Data Fig.\
        \ 4). In addition, we performed extensive phenotypic characterization and\
        \ comparative genome analyses of these four species (Methods) as a basis to\
        \ provisionally name the health-associated bacteria Anaerostipes faecis and\
        \ Sangeribacter muris and the disease-associated bacteria Duncaniella muricolitica\
        \ and Alistipes okayasuensis; of note, the last three species are mouse specific.\
        \ Examination of the relative abundance of each of these species before DSS\
        \ treatment identified significantly higher levels of A. faecis (P = 0264,\
        \ t-test) and S. muris (P = 0.0010, t-test) in those mice without weight loss,\
        \ and significantly higher levels of D. muricolitica (P = 0.0351, t-test)\
        \ and A. okayasuensis (P = 0.0006, t-test) in mice that experienced >5% weight\
        \ loss (Fig. 2f).\\n\\nWe next repeated the DSS experimental model in either\
        \ germ-free mice or germ-free mice stably monocolonized for 4 weeks with one\
        \ of these four bacterial strains (Extended Data Figs. 5a and 6). Control\
        \ germ-free mice treated with DSS neither lost weight (Fig. 3a) nor experienced\
        \ mortality (Fig. 3b) over the course of the experiment, suggesting that the\
        \ presence of gut bacteria is important in triggering overt disease in our\
        \ facility. Comparable experimental outcomes were observed in DSS-treated,\
        \ germ-free mice monocolonized with either of the health-associated bacteria,\
        \ which did not lose weight or develop intestinal pathology (Fig. 3a) nor\
        \ experienced significant mortality (Fig. 3b). In contrast, when DSS-treated\
        \ mice were monocolonized with either of the disease-associated bacteria,\
        \ we observed more rapid and greater weight loss (Fig. 3a) and significantly\
        \ reduced survival (Fig. 3b). Therefore, we identified and validated D. muricolitica\
        \ and A. okayasuensis as mouse bacteria that can promote disease not observed\
        \ in mice monocolonized with the commensal bacteria S. muris and A. faecis.Fig.\

        \ in the intestine potentially caused by disease-associated versus health-associated\
        \ species, we next examined histology, immune cell populations and cytokine\
        \ production. The human-colonizing A. faecis and the facility-prevalent D.\
        \ muricolitica were chosen as exemplary disease- and health-associated bacteria,\
        \ respectively, for these analyses. Flow cytometric analysis of intestinal\
        \ lamina propria leukocytes isolated from germ-free mice monocolonized for\
        \ 4 weeks with either A. faecis or D. muricolitica revealed that colonization\
        \ with either strain did not significantly impact the composition of intestinal\
        \ leukocyte and lymphocyte subsets (Extended Data Figs. 5b,c and 6). However,\
        \ the perturbation and epithelial disruption induced by DSS led to significantly\
        \ increased inflammatory CD64+CD11c+ monocytes/macrophages in the lamina propria\
        \ compartment of the large intestine in D. muricolitica monocolonized mice,\
        \ but not in A. faecis monocolonized mice (Extended Data Figs. 5c,d and 6).\
        \ These monocytes have been shown to play a pathogenic role in the intestine\
        \ in the context of Helicobacter-induced inflammation25. This suggests that,\
        \ although neither pathogenic nor immunogenic at homeostasis, D. muricolitica\
        \ drives increased inflammatory responses in the wake of epithelial damage\
        \ whereas health-associated A. faecis does not. Importantly, while histological\
        \ samples taken after 7 days of DSS treatment from colons and caeca of D.\
        \ muricolitica monocolonized mice occasionally exhibited features of severe\
        \ inflammation, this was not statistically different from that of A. faecis\
        \ monocolonized mice (Fig. 3c,d) and did not consistently correspond to the\
        \ weight loss observed. This again suggests that weight loss in the DSS model\
        \ may not always correlate with intestinal inflammation and pathology.\\n\\\
        nTo determine whether the presence of D. muricolitica or A. faecis had a positive\
        \ or negative correlation with weight change, we next examined 20 independent\
        \ mice and assessed the relationship between bacterial levels using quantitative\
        \ PCR (qPCR) before DSS treatment and weight change observed at day 10. This\
        \ analysis identified a positive correlation between weight change and pre-DSS\
        \ A. faecis abundance (R = 0.3679, P = 0.0046; Fig. 3e). Similarly, a negative\
        \ correlation was observed between weight change and D. muricolitica abundance\
        \ (R2 = 0.3626, P = 0.0050; Fig. 3e). This independent confirmation provides\
        \ further validation of the relationship between these species and the severity\
        \ of DSS colitis; however, additional work is needed to confirm their roles\
        \ as pathobionts.\\n\\n## Global distribution and prevalence in other mouse\
        \ facilities\\n\\nBecause D. muricolitica and A. okayasuensis affected the\
        \ outcome of DSS colitis in our mouse facility, we next explored the presence\
        \ and distribution of these bacteria in other mouse facilities around the\
        \ world. To do so, we first generated a global representation of laboratory\
        \ mouse intestinal microbiomes by curating 582 publicly available shotgun\
        \ metagenome samples from ‘control’, SPF mice. We combined this dataset with\
        \ shotgun metagenomes from feces of 40 mice at the Wellcome Sanger Institute\
        \ to yield a global mouse gut microbiome dataset covering 31 institutes across\
        \ 12 countries. We then determined the prevalence and abundance of health-associated\
        \ bacteria S. muris and A. faecis and disease-associated bacteria D. muricolitica\
        \ and A. okayasuensis in this mouse microbiome dataset.\\n\\nDuncaniella muricolitica\
        \ and A. okayasuensis were both dominant members of the mouse microbiome,\
        \ present in 54.5 and 47.9% of samples and with a mean abundance of 0.52 and\
        \ 0.48% reads per sample, respectively. Importantly, D. muricolitica and A.\
        \ okayasuensis were each detected in 80.6% (25/31) of the institutes included\
        \ in the analyses (Fig. 4), and there were only three institutes that did\
        \ not contain either of these species. For comparison, among health-associated\
        \ species S. muris was the most dominant in the mouse gut microbiota, present\
        \ in 96.5% of samples with a mean abundance of 6.2% reads, while A. faecis\
        \ was a relatively minor species, present in 5.9% of samples with a mean abundance\
        \ of 0.22% reads. S. muris was present in all (31/31) of the institutes included\
        \ in the analyses, whereas A. faecis was detected in 25.8% (8/31). The abundance\
        \ of each species also differed between institutes (Fig. 4). Thus, we show\
        \ that mouse-derived bacteria cultured from our institute are common mouse\
        \ symbionts and, importantly, D. muricolitica and A. okayasuensis are common,\
        \ but not ubiquitous, in animal facilities around the world.Fig. 4Global epidemiology\

        n\\n## Discussion\\n\\nDespite experimental variability in the DSS mouse model,\
        \ which limits the interpretation and translation of data, the model is increasingly\
        \ used in basic research (>6,000 DSS model publications on PubMed) and by\
        \ the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. Cohousing, heterozygote\
        \ mating and other experimental procedures have been used in an attempt to\
        \ normalize the microbiota within experiments and ensure direct measures of\
        \ the effects of mouse genetic background on disease phenotype rather than\
        \ indirect and unknown microbiota-associated effects26. In our approach we\
        \ leveraged this variability in DSS outcome, in combination with microbiome\
        \ analysis, machine learning, anerobic culturing and germ-free mouse validation\
        \ experiments, to gain relevant biological insight into microbiota determinants\
        \ of DSS disease. While this consideration of the microbiome did not completely\
        \ eliminate the impact of multidimensionality in the DSS model, we identified\
        \ and undertook experimental validation of D. muricolitica and A. okayasuensis,\
        \ both of which have a dominant effect on DSS outcome.\\n\\nInterestingly,\
        \ D. muricolitica and A. okayasuensis are phylogenetically distinct from each\
        \ other and neither had computationally predicted virulence factors within\
        \ their genome. While it remains unclear how these isolates contribute to\
        \ DSS disease, both exhibit a potential for polysaccharide utilization that\
        \ may mediate this relationship through interaction with the mucus layer.\
        \ We also noted that weight loss and intestinal pathology do not always correlate,\
        \ so they should not necessarily be used as surrogates for each other. Similarly,\
        \ substantial weight loss was observed in monocolonized mice even in the absence\
        \ of severe inflammation, suggesting that activation of key pathways alone\
        \ can have a substantial impact on experimental outcome. Together, these insights\
        \ raise the need for further experimental study of host interactions and the\
        \ biology of these important mouse-specific bacteria.\\n\\nWe propose that\
        \ researchers should consider monitoring for D. muricolitica and A. okayasuensis\
        \ in their mouse facilities, as is undertaken for other immunophenotyped-affecting\
        \ microbes such as segmented filamentous bacteria27. In some cases, precolonization\
        \ of animals with these bacteria, if they are not present in the facility,\
        \ may yield better experimental control and increase confidence in this important\
        \ and widely used mouse model of human disease. Overall, our work suggests\
        \ that the application of metagenomics techniques to report microbiota composition,\
        \ in addition to the genetic and disease phenotypes being described, should\
        \ represent a standard minimum requirement for the DSS mouse model. We have\
        \ deposited the D. muricolitis, A. okayasuensis, S. muris and A. faecis strains\
        \ and genomes in public repositories to support this work.\\n\\n## Methods\\\
        n\\n### Mouse models\\n\\nMice were maintained under either germ-free or SPF\
        \ conditions at the Wellcome Sanger Institute Home Office-approved facility,\
        \ with all procedures carried out in accordance with the United Kingdom Animals\
        \ (Scientific Procedures) Act of 1986 under Home Office approval (PPL no.\
        \ 80/2643). Germ-free mice were maintained in positive-pressure isolators\
        \ (Bell), with feces tested by culture, microscopy and PCR to ensure sterility.\
        \ Consumables were autoclaved at 121 °C for 15 min before introduction into\
        \ the isolators. For experimentation, cages were opened in a vaporized hydrogen\
        \ peroxide-sterilized, class II cabinet (Bioquell), with fecal transplant\
        \ and monocolonized gnotobiotic lines generated by weekly oral gavage over\
        \ a 3-week period. Materials were prepared in Dulbecco’s PBS at 100 mg ml–1\
        \ immediately before administration under anaerobic conditions (10% H, 10%\
        \ CO2, 80% N) in a Whitley DG250 workstation at 37 °C (ref. 8). Mice were\
        \ maintained in sterile ISOcages (Tecniplast) and housed on ISOrack for the\
        \ period of the experiment.\\n\\n### DSS colitis challenge\\n\\nDextran sulphate\
        \ sodium was administered at a concentration of 1.5% (w/v) (Affymetrix, Inc.,\
        \ average molecular weight 44 kDa) in drinking water for 7 days, followed\
        \ by 3 days with regular drinking water, to C57BL6/6N mice aged 7–16 weeks\
        \ (297 male, 282 female; median age 11 weeks; s.d. 12 days). Mice were weighed\
        \ every day and culled if weight loss reached 20% of starting weight. Average\
        \ weight loss curves were censored for each group when the first member of\
        \ the group reached this endpoint, to avoid misleading calculations of the\
        \ average using the remaining members. No statistical methods were used to\
        \ predetermine sample sizes in these experiments.\\n\\n### Histological assessment\
        \ of intestinal inflammation\\n\\nDextran sulphate sodium-treated SPF mice\
        \ were sacrificed at day 10 by cervical dislocation, and samples from mid\
        \ and distal colon taken. Tissue sections were fixed in buffered 10% formalin,\
        \ paraffin embedded, cut and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Colon\
        \ histopathology was blind-graded semiquantitatively, on a scale from zero\
        \ to three, for four criteria: (1) degree of epithelial hyperplasia/damage\
        \ and goblet cell depletion; (2) leukocyte infiltration in lamina propria;\
        \ (3) area of tissue affected; and (4) presence of markers of severe inflammation,\
        \ including crypt abscesses, submucosal inflammation and edema. Scores for\
        \ individual criteria were added for an overall inflammation score of between\
        \ zero and 12 for each sample. Scores from mid and distal colon were then\
        \ averaged to obtain inflammation scores for each mouse colon.\\n\\nMonocolonized,\
        \ germ-free mice were euthanized 7 days after DSS administration and samples\
        \ taken from the cecum and midcolon. Tissue sections were fixed in methacarn,\
        \ paraffin embedded, sectioned and stained with H&E. Colon and cecum histopathology\
        \ was graded on a semiquantitative scale by a pathologist blinded to the groups.\
        \ The criteria scored were (1) degree of epithelial hyperplasia/damage and\
        \ goblet cell depletion; (2) severity of leukocyte infiltration in lamina\
        \ propria; (3) extent of inflammation; and (4) presence of markers of severe\
        \ inflammation, including crypt abscesses, submucosal inflammation and edema.\
        \ Each criterion was scored on a scale of zero to three based on previously\
        \ described thresholds28 and the sum of the individual scores was recorded\
        \ as an indication of overall inflammation. For all animal experiments, treatments\
        \ were randomized by cage by researchers blinded to treatment conditions.\
        \ For statistical analysis, distribution was assumed to be normal but this\
        \ was not formally tested\\n\\n### Bacterial culture\\n\\nFecal samples and\
        \ bacterial isolates were cultured for anaerobic gastrointestinal bacteria\
        \ under anaerobic conditions (10% H, 10% CO2, 80% N) in a Whitley DG250 workstation\
        \ at 37 °C (ref. 8). Fecal samples were homogenized in reduced PBS (0.1 g\
        \ ml–1 PBS), serially diluted and plated directly onto YCFA agar supplemented\
        \ with 0.002 g ml−1 each of glucose, maltose and cellobiose. Colonies were\
        \ picked, restreaked to purity and identified using 16 S rRNA gene sequencing.\\\
        n\\n### Microbiota profiling and analysis\\n\\nFecal samples were collected\
        \ directly from mice and immediately stored at −80 °C until DNA extraction.\
        \ DNA was extracted from samples using the FastDNA Spin Kit for Soil (MPBio)\
        \ and stored at −20 °C until metagenomic sequencing. DNA samples were quantified\
        \ using a Qubit 4 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher). 16 S rRNA amplicon-based profiling\
        \ was performed using the FastDNA Spin Kit for Soil (MP Biomedicals) on 300\
        \ mg of fecal sample from each mouse. The V1–V2 region of 16 S rRNA genes\
        \ was amplified with a Q5 High-Fidelity Polymerase Kit (New England Biolabs):\
        \ F': AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACAC-TATGGTAATT-CC-AGMGTTYGATYMTGGCTCAG; R':\
        \ CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGATACGAGACTGATTAGTCAGTCAGAAGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAG. Each\
        \ PCR amplification was performed as four independent amplifications and pooled\
        \ in equimolar amounts for 150-base-paired (bp)-end sequencing with the Illumina\
        \ MiSeq platform. For shotgun metagenomic sequencing, samples with >100 ng\
        \ of DNA material were processed onward to paired-end (2 × 150 bp) metagenomics\
        \ sequencing on the HiSeq 4000 platform as per standard manufacturer library\
        \ preparation and sequencing protocols.\\n\\n### Metagenomic data analysis\\\
        n\\nAnalysis of 16 S rRNA amplicon sequences was performed with mothur MiSeq\
        \ SOP v.1.42.3 using SILVA v.132 (ref. 29). The 16 S rRNA gene alignments\
        \ were used to determine maximum likelihood phylogeny using FastTree v.2.1.10\
        \ (ref. 30). Phylogenetic trees were visualized and edited using iTOL31. Shotgun\
        \ metagenomic reads were filtered for quality and adapter sequences using\
        \ KneadData v.0.7.3, with default settings. Host reads were removed from samples\
        \ using the GRCm39 reference genome and Bowtie2 v.2.3.5. In addition, reads\
        \ were aligned to the Phi X 174 genome and removed. Taxonomic classification\
        \ of metagenomic reads was performed using Kraken2 v.2.0.8 and a custom databas...\n\

  reason: The actual output contains no relevant information about the footnote requested.
    Instead, it shows an error message indicating a rate limit exceeded for the AI
    model. This completely fails to address the question or provide any of the expected
    information about Table 3's footnote, resulting in the lowest possible score.

    from the Anthropic API. This completely fails to address the question or provide
    any of the expected details about Juan L. Ramos, resulting in a total lack of
    alignment with the evaluation criteria.

    ## Conclusions Section of PMC4831113


    Here is the **Conclusions** section from the paper "High-quality draft genome
    sequence and description of Haemophilus massiliensis sp. nov.":


    ---


    ### Conclusions


    On the basis of phenotypic, phylogenetic and genomic analyses, we formally propose
    the creation of **Haemophilus massiliensis** sp. nov. that contains strain FF7T
    (CSUR P859 = DSM 28247) which is the type strain. The strain was isolated from
    a peritoneal fluid specimen from a 44-year-old Senegalese woman admitted to Hôpital
    Principal in Dakar, Senegal.


    ### Description of Haemophilus massiliensis sp. nov.


    *Haemophilus massiliensis* (mas.il.i.en''sis. L. gen. masc. n. massiliensis, of
    Massilia, the Latin name of Marseille where strain FF7T was characterized).


    *Haemophilus massiliensis* is a facultatively anaerobic Gram-negative bacterium,
    non-endospore forming and non-motile. Colonies are not haemolytic, round, and
    light with a size of 0.5-1 mm on blood-enriched Colombia agar. Cells are rod-shaped
    with a mean length of 2.6 μm (range 2.0-3.2 μm) and a mean diameter of 0.35 μm
    (range 0.2-0.5 μm). Growth occurs between 25 and 45 °C, with optimal growth occurring
    at 37 °C. Catalase and oxidase reactions are positive. Positive reactions are
    also observed for acid phosphatase, leucine arylamidase, esterase, alkaline phosphatase,
    Naphthol-AS-BI-phosphohydrolase, L-arginine, esculin, ferric citrate, and urea.
    *Haemophilus massiliensis* strain FF7T is susceptible to penicillin, amoxicillin,
    amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, imipenem, gentamicin, ceftriaxone and doxycycline
    but resistant to vancomycin, nitrofurantoin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole.


    The type strain is FF7T (= CSUR P859 = DSM 28247) and was isolated from the peritoneal
    fluid of a 44-year-old Senegalese woman suffering from pelvic peritonitis in Dakar,
    Senegal.


    ---


    The conclusions formally propose the establishment of a new bacterial species,
    *Haemophilus massiliensis*, based on comprehensive phenotypic, phylogenetic, and
    genomic analyses. The section also provides the formal taxonomic description of
    the new species, including its morphological, physiological, and biochemical characteristics.'

      ### Conclusions


      On the basis of phenotypic, phylogenetic and genomic analyses, we formally propose
      the creation of **Haemophilus massiliensis** sp. nov. that contains strain FF7T
      (CSUR P859 = DSM 28247) which is the type strain. The strain was isolated from
      a peritoneal fluid specimen from a 44-year-old Senegalese woman admitted to
      Hôpital Principal in Dakar, Senegal.


      ### Description of Haemophilus massiliensis sp. nov.


      *Haemophilus massiliensis* (mas.il.i.en''sis. L. gen. masc. n. massiliensis,
      of Massilia, the Latin name of Marseille where strain FF7T was characterized).


      *Haemophilus massiliensis* is a facultatively anaerobic Gram-negative bacterium,
      non-endospore forming and non-motile. Colonies are not haemolytic, round, and
      light with a size of 0.5-1 mm on blood-enriched Colombia agar. Cells are rod-shaped
      with a mean length of 2.6 μm (range 2.0-3.2 μm) and a mean diameter of 0.35
      μm (range 0.2-0.5 μm). Growth occurs between 25 and 45 °C, with optimal growth
      occurring at 37 °C. Catalase and oxidase reactions are positive. Positive reactions
      are also observed for acid phosphatase, leucine arylamidase, esterase, alkaline
      phosphatase, Naphthol-AS-BI-phosphohydrolase, L-arginine, esculin, ferric citrate,
      and urea. *Haemophilus massiliensis* strain FF7T is susceptible to penicillin,
      amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, imipenem, gentamicin, ceftriaxone
      and doxycycline but resistant to vancomycin, nitrofurantoin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole.


      The type strain is FF7T (= CSUR P859 = DSM 28247) and was isolated from the
      peritoneal fluid of a 44-year-old Senegalese woman suffering from pelvic peritonitis
      in Dakar, Senegal.

              \ of a 44-year-old woman who suffered from pelvic peritonitis. This\
              \ strain exhibited a 16S rRNA sequence similarity of 94.8 % 16S rRNA\
              \ sequence identity with Haemophilus parasuis, the phylogenetically\
              \ closest species with a name with standing in nomenclature and a poor\
              \ MALDI-TOF MS score (1.32 to 1.56) that does not allow any reliable\
              \ identification. Using a polyphasic study made of phenotypic and genomic\
              \ analyses, strain FF7T was a Gram-negative, facultatively anaerobic\
              \ rod and member of the family Pasteurellaceae. It exhibited a genome\

              \ 2,319 protein-coding and 67 RNA genes, including 6 rRNA operons. On\
              \ the basis of these data, we propose the creation of Haemophilus massiliensis\

              n## Electronic supplementary material\\nThe online version of this article\
              \ (doi:10.1186/s40793-016-0150-1) contains supplementary material, which\
              \ is available to authorized users.\\n\\n## Introduction\\n\\nThe genus\
              \ Haemophilus (Winslow et al. 1917) was described in 1917 [1] and currently\
              \ meningitis, bacteremia, sinusitis, and/or pneumonia [2].\\n\\nThe\
              \ current taxonomic classification of prokaryotes relies on a combination\
              \ of phenotypic and genotypic characteristics [3, 4]; including 16S\
              \ rRNA sequence similarity, G + C content and DNA-DNA hybridization.\
              \ However, these tools suffer from various drawbacks, mainly due to\
              \ their threshold values that are not applicable to all species or genera\
              \ [5, 6]. With the development of cost-effective, high-throughput sequencing\
              \ techniques, dozens of thousands of bacterial genome sequences have\
              \ been made available in public databases [7]. Recently, we developed\
              \ a strategy named taxono-genomics in which genomic and phenotypic characteristics,\
              \ notably the MALDI-TOF-MS spectrum, are systematically compared to\
              \ the phylogenetically-closest species with a name with standing in\
              \ nomenclature [8, 9].\\n\\nThe strain FF7T was isolated from the peritoneal\
              \ fluid of a Senegalese woman suffering from pelvic peritonitis complicating\
              \ a ruptured ovarian abscess. She was admitted to Hôpital Principal\
              \ in Dakar, Senegal. Haemophilus massiliensis is a Gram-negative, facultatively\
              \ anaerobic, oxidase and catalase-positive and non-motile rod shaped\
              \ bacterium. This microorganism was cultivated as part of the MALDI-TOF-MS\
              \ implementation in Hôpital Principal in Dakar, aiming at improving\
              \ the routine laboratory identification of bacterial strains in Senegal\
              \ [10].\\n\\nHere, we present a summary classification and a set of\
              \ features for Haemophilus massiliensis sp. nov. together with the description\
              \ of the complete genome sequencing and annotation. These characteristics\
              \ support the circumscription of the species Haemophilus massiliensis.\\\

              nIn June 2013, a bacterial strain (Table 1) was isolated by cultivation\
              \ on 5 % sheep blood-enriched Columbia agar (BioMérieux, Marcy l'Etoile,\
              \ France) of a peritoneal fluid specimen obtained from a 44-year-old\
              \ Senegalese woman who suffered from pelvic peritonitis that had complicated\
              \ a ruptured ovarian abscess [10] and hospitalized in Hôpital Principal\

              \ Growth was obtained between 25 and 45 °C, with the optimal growth\
              \ temperature being 37 °C. Colonies were 0.5 mm in diameter and non-hemolytic\
              \ on 5 % sheep blood-enriched Columbia agar (BioMérieux). Gram staining\
              \ showed rod-shaped Gram-negative bacilli that were not motile and unable\
              \ to form spores (Fig. 2). In electron microscopy, cells had a mean\
              \ length of 2.6 μm (range 2.0-3.2 μm) and width of 0.35 μm (range 0.2-0.5\
              \ μm) (Fig. 2). Growth of the strain was tested under anaerobic and\
              \ microaerophilic conditions using GENbag anaer and GENbag microaer\
              \ systems, respectively (BioMérieux), and under aerobic conditions,\
              \ with or without 5 % CO2. Optimal growth was observed at 37 °C under\
              \ aerobic and microaerophilic conditions. Strain FF7T exhibited oxidase\
              \ and catalase activities. Using an API ZYM strip (BioMérieux), positive\
              \ reactions were observed for acid phosphatase, leucine arylamidase,\
              \ esterase, alkaline phosphatase and Naphthol-AS-BI-phosphohydrolase.\
              \ Negative reactions were noted for α-chymotrypsin, cystine arylamidase,\

              \ α-mannosidase, α-fucosidase, and N-acetyl-β-glucosaminidase. Using\
              \ API 20NE (BioMérieux), positive reactions were obtained for L-arginine,\
              \ esculin, ferric citrate and urea but negative reactions were observed\
              \ for D-glucose, L-arabinose, D-maltose, D-mannose, D-mannitol, potassium\
              \ gluconate and N-acetyl-glucosamine. Haemophilusmassiliensis strain\
              \ FF7T is susceptible to penicillin, amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic\

              \ temperatures (25 °C, 30 °C, 37 °C, 45 °C, and 56 °C) were tested.\
              \ Growth was obtained between 25 and 45 °C, with the optimal growth\

              \ systems, respectively (BioMérieux), and under aerobic conditions,\
              \ with or without 5 % CO2. Optimal growth was observed at 37 °C under\
              \ aerobic and microaerophilic conditions. Strain FF7T exhibited oxidase\
              \ and catalase activities. Using an API ZYM strip (BioMérieux), positive\
              \ reactions were observed for acid phosphatase, leucine arylamidase,\

              n\\nHaemophilus massiliensis sp. nov., strain FF7T (= CSUR P859= DSM\
              \ 28247) was grown aerobically on 5 % sheep blood-enriched Columbia\
              \ agar (BioMérieux) at 37 °C. Bacteria grown on four Petri dishes were\
              \ resuspended in 5x100 μL of TE buffer; 150 μL of this suspension was\
              \ diluted in 350 μL TE buffer 10X, 25 μL proteinase K and 50 μL sodium\
              \ dodecyl sulfate for lysis treatment. This preparation was incubated\
              \ overnight at 56 °C. Extracted DNA was purified using 3 successive\
              \ phenol-chloroform extractions and ethanol precipitations. Following\
              \ centrifugation, the DNA was suspended in 65 μL EB buffer. The genomic\
              \ DNA (gDNA) concentration was measured at 14.7 ng/μl using the Qubit\
              \ assay with the high sensitivity kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad,\
              \ CA, USA).\\n\\n### Genome sequencing and assembly\\n\\nGenomic DNA\
              \ of Haemophilus massiliensis FF7T was sequenced on the MiSeq sequencer\
              \ (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) with the Mate-Pair strategy. The gDNA\
              \ was barcoded in order to be mixed with 11 other projects with the\
              \ Nextera Mate-Pair sample prep kit (Illumina). The Mate-Pair library\
              \ was prepared with 1 μg of genomic DNA using the Nextera Mate-Pair\
              \ Illumina guide. The gDNA sample was simultaneously fragmented and\
              \ tagged with a Mate-Pair junction adapter. The pattern of the fragmentation\
              \ was validated on an Agilent 2100 BioAnalyzer (Agilent Technologies,\
              \ Santa Clara, CA, USA) with a DNA 7500 labchip. The DNA fragments ranged\
              \ in size from 1 kb up to 10 kb with an optimal size at 4.08 kb. No\
              \ size selection was performed and only 464 ng of tagmented fragments\
              \ were circularized. The circularized DNA was mechanically sheared to\
              \ small fragments with an optimal at 569 bp on the Covaris S2 device\
              \ in microtubes (Covaris, Woburn, MA, USA). The library profile was\
              \ visualized on a High Sensitivity Bioanalyzer LabChip (Agilent Technologies)\
              \ and the final library concentration was measured at 24.42 nmol/L.\
              \ The libraries were normalized at 2nM and pooled. After a denaturation\
              \ step and dilution at 15 pM, the pool of libraries was loaded onto\
              \ the reagent cartridge and then onto the instrument along with the\
              \ flow cell. Automated cluster generation and sequencing run were performed\
              \ in a single 39-h-run in a 2x251-bp. Total information of 10.1Gb was\
              \ obtained from a 1,189 K/mm2 cluster density with a cluster passing\
              \ quality control filters of 99.1 % (22,579,000 clusters). Within this\
              \ run, the index representation for Haemophilus massiliensis was 9.72\
              \ %. The 1,976,771 paired reads were filtered according to the read\
              \ qualities. These reads were trimmed, then assembled using the CLC\
              \ genomicsWB4 software. Finally, the draft genome of Haemophilusmassiliensis\
              \ consists of 9 scaffolds with 46 contigs and generated a genome size\
              \ of 2.4 Mb with a 46.0 % G + C content.\\n\\n### Genome annotation\\\

              \ parameters but the predicted ORFs were excluded if they spanned a\

              \ searched against the GenBank database [15] and the Clusters of Orthologous\
              \ Groups databases using BLASTP. The tRNAScanSE tool [16] was used to\
              \ find tRNA genes, whereas ribosomal RNAs were found using RNAmmer [17]\
              \ and BLASTn against the GenBank database. Lipoprotein signal peptides\
              \ and the number of transmembrane helices were predicted using SignalP\
              \ [18] and TMHMM [19] respectively. ORFans were identified if their\
              \ BLASTP E-value was lower than 1e-03 for alignment length greater than\
              \ 80 amino acids. If alignment lengths were smaller than 80 amino acids,\
              \ we used an E-value of 1e-05. Such parameter thresholds have already\
              \ been used in previous works to define ORFans. Artemis [20] was used\
              \ for data management and DNA Plotter [21] for visualization of genomic\
              \ features. The Mauve alignment tool (version 2.3.1) was used for multiple\
              \ genomic sequence alignment [22]. To estimate the mean level of nucleotide\
              \ sequence similarity at the genome level, we used the AGIOS home-made\
              \ software [9]. Briefly, this software combines the Proteinortho software\
              \ [23] for detecting orthologous proteins in pairwise genomic comparisons,\

              \ of nucleotide sequence identity among orthologous ORFs using the Needleman-Wunsch\
              \ global alignment algorithm. The script created to calculate AGIOS\

          ### Conclusions


          On the basis of phenotypic, phylogenetic and genomic analyses, we formally
          propose the creation of **Haemophilus massiliensis** sp. nov. that contains
          strain FF7T (CSUR P859 = DSM 28247) which is the type strain. The strain
          was isolated from a peritoneal fluid specimen from a 44-year-old Senegalese
          woman admitted to Hôpital Principal in Dakar, Senegal.


          ### Description of Haemophilus massiliensis sp. nov.


          *Haemophilus massiliensis* (mas.il.i.en''sis. L. gen. masc. n. massiliensis,
          of Massilia, the Latin name of Marseille where strain FF7T was characterized).


          *Haemophilus massiliensis* is a facultatively anaerobic Gram-negative bacterium,
          non-endospore forming and non-motile. Colonies are not haemolytic, round,
          and light with a size of 0.5-1 mm on blood-enriched Colombia agar. Cells
          are rod-shaped with a mean length of 2.6 μm (range 2.0-3.2 μm) and a mean
          diameter of 0.35 μm (range 0.2-0.5 μm). Growth occurs between 25 and 45

          The conclusions formally propose the establishment of a new bacterial species,
          *Haemophilus massiliensis*, based on comprehensive phenotypic, phylogenetic,

        nStrain FF7T was isolated from the peritoneal fluid of a 44-year-old woman\
        \ who suffered from pelvic peritonitis. This strain exhibited a 16S rRNA sequence\
        \ similarity of 94.8 % 16S rRNA sequence identity with Haemophilus parasuis,\
        \ the phylogenetically closest species with a name with standing in nomenclature\
        \ and a poor MALDI-TOF MS score (1.32 to 1.56) that does not allow any reliable\
        \ identification. Using a polyphasic study made of phenotypic and genomic\
        \ analyses, strain FF7T was a Gram-negative, facultatively anaerobic rod and\
        \ member of the family Pasteurellaceae. It exhibited a genome of 2,442,548\
        \ bp long genome (one chromosome but no plasmid) contains 2,319 protein-coding\
        \ and 67 RNA genes, including 6 rRNA operons. On the basis of these data,\
        \ we propose the creation of Haemophilus massiliensis sp. nov. with strain\
        \ FF7T (= CSUR P859 = DSM 28247) as the type strain.\\n## Electronic supplementary\

        n\\n## Introduction\\n\\nThe genus Haemophilus (Winslow et al. 1917) was described\
        \ in 1917 [1] and currently meningitis, bacteremia, sinusitis, and/or pneumonia\
        \ [2].\\n\\nThe current taxonomic classification of prokaryotes relies on\
        \ a combination of phenotypic and genotypic characteristics [3, 4]; including\
        \ 16S rRNA sequence similarity, G + C content and DNA-DNA hybridization. However,\
        \ these tools suffer from various drawbacks, mainly due to their threshold\
        \ values that are not applicable to all species or genera [5, 6]. With the\
        \ development of cost-effective, high-throughput sequencing techniques, dozens\
        \ of thousands of bacterial genome sequences have been made available in public\
        \ databases [7]. Recently, we developed a strategy named taxono-genomics in\
        \ which genomic and phenotypic characteristics, notably the MALDI-TOF-MS spectrum,\
        \ are systematically compared to the phylogenetically-closest species with\
        \ a name with standing in nomenclature [8, 9].\\n\\nThe strain FF7T was isolated\
        \ from the peritoneal fluid of a Senegalese woman suffering from pelvic peritonitis\
        \ complicating a ruptured ovarian abscess. She was admitted to Hôpital Principal\
        \ in Dakar, Senegal. Haemophilus massiliensis is a Gram-negative, facultatively\
        \ anaerobic, oxidase and catalase-positive and non-motile rod shaped bacterium.\
        \ This microorganism was cultivated as part of the MALDI-TOF-MS implementation\
        \ in Hôpital Principal in Dakar, aiming at improving the routine laboratory\
        \ identification of bacterial strains in Senegal [10].\\n\\nHere, we present\
        \ a summary classification and a set of features for Haemophilus massiliensis\
        \ sp. nov. together with the description of the complete genome sequencing\
        \ and annotation. These characteristics support the circumscription of the\
        \ species Haemophilus massiliensis.\\n\\n## Organism information\\n\\n###\
        \ Classification and features\\n\\nIn June 2013, a bacterial strain (Table\
        \ 1) was isolated by cultivation on 5 % sheep blood-enriched Columbia agar\
        \ (BioMérieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France) of a peritoneal fluid specimen obtained\
        \ from a 44-year-old Senegalese woman who suffered from pelvic peritonitis\
        \ that had complicated a ruptured ovarian abscess [10] and hospitalized in\
        \ Hôpital Principal de Dakar, Senegal. The strain could not be identified\
        \ using MALDI-TOF-MS. Strain FF7T exhibited a 94.8 % 16S rRNA sequence identity\
        \ with Haemophilus parasuis strain ATCC 19417T (GenBank accession number AY362909),\
        \ the phylogenetically-closest bacterial species with a validly published\
        \ name (Fig. 1). These values were lower than the 98.7 % 16S rRNA gene sequence\
        \ threshold recommended by Meier-Kolthoff et al., 2013 to delineate a new\
        \ species within phylum Proteobacteria without carrying out wet lab or digital\

        \ massiliensis sp. nov., strain FF7T (= CSUR P859= DSM 28247) was grown aerobically\
        \ on 5 % sheep blood-enriched Columbia agar (BioMérieux) at 37 °C. Bacteria\
        \ grown on four Petri dishes were resuspended in 5x100 μL of TE buffer; 150\
        \ μL of this suspension was diluted in 350 μL TE buffer 10X, 25 μL proteinase\
        \ K and 50 μL sodium dodecyl sulfate for lysis treatment. This preparation\
        \ was incubated overnight at 56 °C. Extracted DNA was purified using 3 successive\
        \ phenol-chloroform extractions and ethanol precipitations. Following centrifugation,\
        \ the DNA was suspended in 65 μL EB buffer. The genomic DNA (gDNA) concentration\
        \ was measured at 14.7 ng/μl using the Qubit assay with the high sensitivity\
        \ kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA).\\n\\n### Genome sequencing and\
        \ assembly\\n\\nGenomic DNA of Haemophilus massiliensis FF7T was sequenced\
        \ on the MiSeq sequencer (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) with the Mate-Pair\
        \ strategy. The gDNA was barcoded in order to be mixed with 11 other projects\
        \ with the Nextera Mate-Pair sample prep kit (Illumina). The Mate-Pair library\
        \ was prepared with 1 μg of genomic DNA using the Nextera Mate-Pair Illumina\
        \ guide. The gDNA sample was simultaneously fragmented and tagged with a Mate-Pair\
        \ junction adapter. The pattern of the fragmentation was validated on an Agilent\
        \ 2100 BioAnalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) with a DNA\
        \ 7500 labchip. The DNA fragments ranged in size from 1 kb up to 10 kb with\
        \ an optimal size at 4.08 kb. No size selection was performed and only 464\
        \ ng of tagmented fragments were circularized. The circularized DNA was mechanically\
        \ sheared to small fragments with an optimal at 569 bp on the Covaris S2 device\
        \ in microtubes (Covaris, Woburn, MA, USA). The library profile was visualized\
        \ on a High Sensitivity Bioanalyzer LabChip (Agilent Technologies) and the\
        \ final library concentration was measured at 24.42 nmol/L. The libraries\
        \ were normalized at 2nM and pooled. After a denaturation step and dilution\
        \ at 15 pM, the pool of libraries was loaded onto the reagent cartridge and\

        \ using Prodigal [14] with default parameters but the predicted ORFs were\
        \ excluded if they spanned a sequencing gap region. The predicted bacterial\
        \ protein sequences were searched against the GenBank database [15] and the\
        \ Clusters of Orthologous Groups databases using BLASTP. The tRNAScanSE tool\
        \ [16] was used to find tRNA genes, whereas ribosomal RNAs were found using\
        \ RNAmmer [17] and BLASTn against the GenBank database. Lipoprotein signal\
        \ peptides and the number of transmembrane helices were predicted using SignalP\
        \ [18] and TMHMM [19] respectively. ORFans were identified if their BLASTP\
        \ E-value was lower than 1e-03 for alignment length greater than 80 amino\
        \ acids. If alignment lengths were smaller than 80 amino acids, we used an\
        \ E-value of 1e-05. Such parameter thresholds have already been used in previous\
        \ works to define ORFans. Artemis [20] was used for data management and DNA\
        \ Plotter [21] for visualization of genomic features. The Mauve alignment\
        \ tool (version 2.3.1) was used for multiple genomic sequence alignment [22].\
        \ To estimate the mean level of nucleotide sequence similarity at the genome\
        \ level, we used the AGIOS home-made software [9]. Briefly, this software\
        \ combines the Proteinortho software [23] for detecting orthologous proteins\
        \ in pairwise genomic comparisons, then retrieves the corresponding genes\
        \ and determines the mean percentage of nucleotide sequence identity among\
        \ orthologous ORFs using the Needleman-Wunsch global alignment algorithm.\
        \ The script created to calculate AGIOS values was named MAGi and is written\
        \ in perl and bioperl modules. GGDC analysis was also performed using the\
        \ GGDC web server as previously reported [24, 25].\\n\\n## Genome project\

        \ massiliensis sp. nov., strain FF7T (= CSUR P859= DSM 28247) was grown aerobically\
        \ on 5 % sheep blood-enriched Columbia agar (BioMérieux) at 37 °C. Bacteria\
        \ grown on four Petri dishes were resuspended in 5x100 μL of TE buffer; 150\
        \ μL of this suspension was diluted in 350 μL TE buffer 10X, 25 μL proteinase\
        \ K and 50 μL sodium dodecyl sulfate for lysis treatment. This preparation\
        \ was incubated overnight at 56 °C. Extracted DNA was purified using 3 successive\
        \ phenol-chloroform extractions and ethanol precipitations. Following centrifugation,\
        \ the DNA was suspended in 65 μL EB buffer. The genomic DNA (gDNA) concentration\
        \ was measured at 14.7 ng/μl using the Qubit assay with the high sensitivity\
        \ kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA).\\n\\n## Genome sequencing and\
        \ assembly\\n\\nGenomic DNA of Haemophilus massiliensis FF7T was sequenced\
        \ on the MiSeq sequencer (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) with the Mate-Pair\
        \ strategy. The gDNA was barcoded in order to be mixed with 11 other projects\
        \ with the Nextera Mate-Pair sample prep kit (Illumina). The Mate-Pair library\
        \ was prepared with 1 μg of genomic DNA using the Nextera Mate-Pair Illumina\
        \ guide. The gDNA sample was simultaneously fragmented and tagged with a Mate-Pair\
        \ junction adapter. The pattern of the fragmentation was validated on an Agilent\
        \ 2100 BioAnalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) with a DNA\
        \ 7500 labchip. The DNA fragments ranged in size from 1 kb up to 10 kb with\
        \ an optimal size at 4.08 kb. No size selection was performed and only 464\
        \ ng of tagmented fragments were circularized. The circularized DNA was mechanically\
        \ sheared to small fragments with an optimal at 569 bp on the Covaris S2 device\
        \ in microtubes (Covaris, Woburn, MA, USA). The library profile was visualized\
        \ on a High Sensitivity Bioanalyzer LabChip (Agilent Technologies) and the\
        \ final library concentration was measured at 24.42 nmol/L. The libraries\
        \ were normalized at 2nM and pooled. After a denaturation step and dilution\
        \ at 15 pM, the pool of libraries was loaded onto the reagent cartridge and\
        \ then onto the instrument along with the flow cell. Automated cluster generation\
        \ and sequencing run were performed in a single 39-h-run in a 2x251-bp. Total\

        \ coding genes and 67 were RNA genes, including six complete rRNA operons.\
        \ A total of 1,885 genes (79.5 %) were assigned a putative function. A total\
        \ of 36 genes were identified as ORFans (1.5 %). The remaining genes were\
        \ annotated as hypothetical proteins. The properties and statistics of the\
        \ genome are summarized in Table 3 and Fig. 3. The distribution of genes into\

        \ 1917) was described in 1917 [1] and currently meningitis, bacteremia, sinusitis,\
        \ and/or pneumonia [2].The current taxonomic classification of prokaryotes\
        \ relies on a combination of phenotypic and genotypic characteristics [3,\
        \ 4]; including 16S rRNA sequence similarity, G + C content and DNA-DNA hybridization.\
        \ However, these tools suffer from various drawbacks, mainly due to their\
        \ threshold values that are not applicable to all species or genera [5, 6].\
        \ With the development of cost-effective, high-throughput sequencing techniques,\
        \ dozens of thousands of bacterial genome sequences have been made available\
        \ in public databases [7]. Recently, we developed a strategy named taxono-genomics\
        \ in which genomic and phenotypic characteristics, notably the MALDI-TOF-MS\
        \ spectrum, are systematically compared to the phylogenetically-closest species\
        \ with a name with standing in nomenclature [8, 9].The strain FF7T was isolated\
        \ from the peritoneal fluid of a Senegalese woman suffering from pelvic peritonitis\
        \ complicating a ruptured ovarian abscess. She was admitted to Hôpital Principal\
        \ in Dakar, Senegal. Haemophilus massiliensis is a Gram-negative, facultatively\
        \ anaerobic, oxidase and catalase-positive and non-motile rod shaped bacterium.\
        \ This microorganism was cultivated as part of the MALDI-TOF-MS implementation\
        \ in Hôpital Principal in Dakar, aiming at improving the routine laboratory\
        \ identification of bacterial strains in Senegal [10].Here, we present a summary\
        \ classification and a set of features for Haemophilus massiliensis sp. nov.\

    \ answer:\nBased on PMID 33926573, **yes, microbes from alkaline sulphidic tailings\
    \ do show evidence of oxidative stress responses**. \n\n## Key Evidence from the\
    \ Study:\n\n### 1. **Extensive Oxidative Stress Response Systems Detected**\n\
    The study found that dominant microbial species in the alkaline sulphidic tailings\
    \ possessed **powerful resistance systems for oxidative stresses**. Specifically,\
    \ the researchers detected multiple oxidative stress response genes across the\
    \ analyzed microorganisms:\n\n- **Glutathione S-transferase genes (GT)** - found\
    \ in 5/8 genera\n- **Methylglyoxal detoxification genes (Glo)** - found in 7/8\
    \ genera  \n- **SAM-dependent methyltransferase genes (SAM)** - found in 2/8 genera\n\
    - **Ferroxidase genes (Fr)** - found in 8/8 genera\n- **Oxidative stress response\
    \ genes (NO)** - found in 3/8 genera\n- **Superoxide dismutase genes (SOD)** -\
    \ found in 7/8 genera\n\n### 2. **Environmental Sources of Oxidative Stress**\n\
    The study explains why these microbes need such extensive oxidative stress defenses:\n\
    \n- **Iron-mediated oxidative damage**: The Fenton reaction of intracellular Fe²⁺\
    \ with superoxide is described as \"fatal to cells\"\n- **High metal content**:\
    \ The tailings contain ~1300 mg/kg Cu, ~1800 mg/kg Pb, and ~2900 mg/kg Zn\n- **Sulphide\
    \ weathering processes**: Generate reactive species that can cause oxidative damage\n\
    \n### 3. **Specific Protective Mechanisms**\nThe researchers identified several\
    \ key protective strategies:\n\n- **Iron homeostasis**: Genes for iron uptake\
    \ systems (pit, SDP, efu) and ferroxidases to manage iron levels\n- **Antioxidant\
    \ enzymes**: Superoxide dismutases to neutralize superoxide radicals\n- **Detoxification\
    \ systems**: Methylglyoxal detoxification and glutaredoxin systems\n- **Cellular\
    \ protection**: Glutathione S-transferases for general oxidative protection\n\n\
    ### **Important Note: Retracted Publication**\nIt's crucial to note that this\
    \ paper has been **retracted** (as indicated in the metadata: \"Retracted Publication\"\
    \ and reference to retraction in 2024). Therefore, while the findings suggest\
    \ oxidative stress responses in alkaline sulphidic tailings microbes, these results\
    \ should be interpreted with caution and additional independent studies would\
    \ be needed to confirm these findings.\n\nThe evidence presented in the original\
    \ study strongly suggested that microbes in alkaline sulphidic tailings environments\
    \ do indeed experience and respond to significant oxidative stresses through multiple\
    \ sophisticated molecular mechanisms."

      \ showing a retraction notice from June 2024). However, I can still analyze\
      \ the original findings to answer your question about oxidative stress in microbes\
      \ from alkaline sulphidic tailings.\n\nLet me get the full text to provide a\
      \ detailed answer:\nBased on PMID 33926573, **yes, microbes from alkaline sulphidic\
      \ tailings do show evidence of oxidative stress responses**. \n\n## Key Evidence\
      \ from the Study:\n\n### 1. **Extensive Oxidative Stress Response Systems Detected**\n\
      The study found that dominant microbial species in the alkaline sulphidic tailings\
      \ possessed **powerful resistance systems for oxidative stresses**. Specifically,\
      \ the researchers detected multiple oxidative stress response genes across the\
      \ analyzed microorganisms:\n\n- **Glutathione S-transferase genes (GT)** - found\
      \ in 5/8 genera\n- **Methylglyoxal detoxification genes (Glo)** - found in 7/8\
      \ genera  \n- **SAM-dependent methyltransferase genes (SAM)** - found in 2/8\
      \ genera\n- **Ferroxidase genes (Fr)** - found in 8/8 genera\n- **Oxidative\
      \ stress response genes (NO)** - found in 3/8 genera\n- **Superoxide dismutase\
      \ genes (SOD)** - found in 7/8 genera\n\n### 2. **Environmental Sources of Oxidative\
      \ Stress**\nThe study explains why these microbes need such extensive oxidative\
      \ stress defenses:\n\n- **Iron-mediated oxidative damage**: The Fenton reaction\
      \ of intracellular Fe²⁺ with superoxide is described as \"fatal to cells\"\n\
      - **High metal content**: The tailings contain ~1300 mg/kg Cu, ~1800 mg/kg Pb,\
      \ and ~2900 mg/kg Zn\n- **Sulphide weathering processes**: Generate reactive\
      \ species that can cause oxidative damage\n\n### 3. **Specific Protective Mechanisms**\n\
      The researchers identified several key protective strategies:\n\n- **Iron homeostasis**:\
      \ Genes for iron uptake systems (pit, SDP, efu) and ferroxidases to manage iron\
      \ levels\n- **Antioxidant enzymes**: Superoxide dismutases to neutralize superoxide\
      \ radicals\n- **Detoxification systems**: Methylglyoxal detoxification and glutaredoxin\
      \ systems\n- **Cellular protection**: Glutathione S-transferases for general\
      \ oxidative protection\n\n### **Important Note: Retracted Publication**\nIt's\
      \ crucial to note that this paper has been **retracted** (as indicated in the\
      \ metadata: \"Retracted Publication\" and reference to retraction in 2024).\
      \ Therefore, while the findings suggest oxidative stress responses in alkaline\
      \ sulphidic tailings microbes, these results should be interpreted with caution\
      \ and additional independent studies would be needed to confirm these findings.\n\
      \nThe evidence presented in the original study strongly suggested that microbes\
      \ in alkaline sulphidic tailings environments do indeed experience and respond\
      \ to significant oxidative stresses through multiple sophisticated molecular\
      \ mechanisms."

              n\\nMine tailings are milled residue wastes of ore processing. Those\
              \ of metal mines, typically Pb/Zn/Cu/Ni, always contain abundant sulphides\
              \ that are mostly pyrite based, e.g. FeS2. Due to the high reactivity\
              \ of sulphides, high levels of metals and salinity can be generated\
              \ by the coupled weathering of sulphide and carbonate wastes [1]. This\
              \ makes mine tailings a rather hostile environment to microbes, while\
              \ still a considerable amount cells, though with a relatively low diversity\
              \ compared with normal soils, had been detected therein [1]. The contribution\
              \ of microbial activities to the weathering of sulphides has long been\
              \ recognized in mine tailings. At the acid mine drainage (AMD) site\
              \ of Iron Mountain, Calif., Thiobacillus ferrooxidans and Leptospirillum\
              \ ferrooxidans were found to be dominant in the community and contribute\
              \ to the generation of AMD [2]. In a copper bioleaching heap, sulfurophilic\
              \ and iron-ophilic acidophilic bacteria were found to actively colonize\
              \ the mineral surface [3]. These microbes show adaptability to extremely\
              \ acidic environment and play an important role in the sustainability\
              \ of this system. With the advent of the modern molecular tools, community\
              \ genomics of microbial consortia in acid mine environments has been\
              \ well explored [4, 5], while that of alkaline mine tailings has not\
              \ been extensively studied. Alkaline mine environment is normally subjected\
              \ to revegetation which requires the establishment of soil function\
              \ including microbial diversity [6].\\n\\nMicrobial community networks\
              \ related to sulphide weathering in neutralized tailings have been determined\
              \ [7, 8], yet these studies are based on mainly 16S rRNA gene detection\
              \ and then possible functions of the community members are inferred\
              \ from physiological information of known related pure cultures. This\
              \ approach is useful but is highly limited and speculative with regard\
              \ to approximating the community metabolic capabilities related to the\
              \ in situ elemental cycling and adaptation strategies. In contrast,\
              \ metagenome-based analyses enable reconstruction of nearly complete\
              \ genomes of microbial community members. Such analyses provides detailed\
              \ insights of metabolic capabilities and enables estimating the possible\
              \ contributions of populations to the community processes [5]. Metagenomic\
              \ approaches have been successfully used to resolve the microbial biogeochemical\
              \ potential in saline sea water [9, 10], and to reconstruct microbial\
              \ metabolism in AMD. It is found that acidophilic bacteria community\
              \ in AMD has a microbial diversity higher than expected [11, 12]. Recently,\
              \ draft genomes acquired through metagenomics have been used to understand\
              \ the bacterial colonization of the infant gut [13] and microbial systems\
              \ in hypersaline lakes [14].\\n\\nIn this study, we analyzed metagenomes\
              \ of alkaline sulphidic tailings from a tailings storage facility of\
              \ northwest Queensland. Microbial metabolic capabilities for stress\
              \ resistance and elemental cycling were implied through the annotation\
              \ of 10 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from the tailings metagenomes.\
              \ The results may provide further understanding on biogeochemistry of\
              \ alkaline sulphidic tailings and valuable inference for tailings revegetation\
              \ practice.\\n\\n## Materials and methods\\n\\n### Sampling\\n\\nSampling\
              \ sites and methods have been described in our previous studies [15,\
              \ 16]. Briefly, base metal mine tailings were sampled from a storage\
              \ facility Mt Isa, northwest Queensland. The microbial community structure\
              \ based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing related to revegetation has been\
              \ determined and described elsewhere. The tailings mainly comprise of\
              \ quartz, dolomite, pyrite, gypsum and kaolinite, and contain approximately\
              \ 1300, 1800 and 2900 mg/kg of residue Cu, Pb and Zn, respectively.\
              \ The 16S-based amplicon sequencing reveals that the dominant microbial\
              \ species in the tailings include Rubrobacter spp. of the Actinobacteria,\
              \ Truepera spp. of the Deinococcus-Thermus, and Thioalkalivibrio spp.\
              \ and Thiobacillus spp. of the Proteobacteria. No substantial changes\
              \ were detected of the microbial community structure in summer and in\
              \ winter [6], and dominant species changed little in spite of significant\
              \ increases in diversity detected along with the revegetation efforts\
              \ [15].\\n\\n### Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH)\\n\\nCells\
              \ from the tailings samples were firstly enriched by a sucrose density\
              \ centrifugation [17], followed by the standard FISH procedure for soil\
              \ with minor modifications [18, 19]. To obtain sufficient microbial\
              \ cells from the tailings, quadruplicates with 5 g of tailings each\
              \ were used for cell enrichment. Oligonucleotide probes were used for\
              \ detecting bacteria (mixed EUB338) and archaea (ARCH915) [20]. The\
              \ hybridized samples were observed within 24 h of performing the FISH\
              \ and images were taken using a ZEISS LSM 510 META Confocal Microscope.\
              \ For enumeration of microorganisms, from each sample a total of 30\
              \ confocal acquisitions were taken, and 21 quality images were used\
              \ to determine the cell abundances using DAIME 1.3 [21].\\n\\n### DNA\

              \ DNA Isolation Kit (MO BIO Laboratories, Inc.), after cell enrichment\
              \ using the previously described protocol [17]. A total of seven DNA\
              \ samples of tailings samples were subjected to shotgun sequencing.\
              \ The sequencing was done at the Institute for Molecular Bioscience,\
              \ The University of Queensland, using Illumina MiSeq with paired-end\
              \ 300 bp reads. The detailed sequencing method is described in our previous\
              \ study [16].\\n\\n### Bioinformatics\\n\\nFor the purpose of high quality\
              \ assembly of the metagenome, the seven metagenomes were pooled together\
              \ and analyzed using the flexible pipeline MetaWRAP [22] for genome-resolved\
              \ metagenomic data analysis. The assembly module was used for sequence\
              \ assembly. The assembly contigs obtained were all longer than 1000\
              \ bp. The workflow of MaxBin2 in MetaWRAP was used for contig encapsulation.\
              \ MetaWRAP provides three assembly pipelines, namely Concoct, Metabat2\
              \ and Maxbin2, and after comparison Maxbin2 was chose for subsequent\
              \ analysis [23]. Then the obtained bins were further analyzed for species\
              \ annotation. Species annotation was performed in the annotate_bins\
              \ module, based on the NCBI_nt and NCBI_tax databases. Taxator-tk was\
              \ used for the classification of each contig, and a bin as a whole was\
              \ estimated to annotate species. CheckM was used for the quality assessment\
              \ of the assembled bins (MAGs; https://ecogenomics.github.io/CheckM/).\
              \ For gene annotation, a cutoff E value of 10− 6 and an identity of\
              \ 70% were used. Metawrap was run on a 42-core, 192 GB RAM server. Bins\

              n\\n### The environment\\n\\nThe tailings studied are basically neutral/alkaline\
              \ in pH and of a high level of residue heavy metals, salinity and sulphidic\
              \ minerals. Salinity and metal release in sulphidic tailings is mostly\
              \ from the coupled weathering of sulphides and carbonates. The microbially-mediated\
              \ and chemical-mediated weathering of sulphides would have both occurred\
              \ in the amended and revegetated tailings [15]. The microbial processes\
              \ may become as important as the chemical weathering processes in neutral/alkaline\
              \ sulphidic tailings, where the redox potential of oxygen and ferric\
              \ is reduced by the high pH and ferrous can be oxidized more easily\
              \ with diverse electron-acceptors (e.g. nitrate) [25]. Moreover, increased\
              \ nutrients supplied from the organic matter amendment and plant roots,\
              \ as indicated by our previous studies, is very likely resulting in\
              \ increased activities of the sulphide weathering microorganisms [6].\\\
              n\\n### Cell abundance in the tailings\\n\\nCell abundance in the tailings\
              \ was enumerated using conventional FISH. We examined samples by FISH\
              \ that were prepared as either sterilized raw tailings, the raw tailings\
              \ or a cell enrichment obtained from the tailings by sucrose density\
              \ gradient centrifugation. Strong background fluorescence was observed\
              \ and direct observation of cell fluorescence was impossible for raw\
              \ tailings materials. Background fluorescence is a common problem for\
              \ cell enumeration in soil-like materials using FISH, and can be strong\
              \ in metal tailings due to the presence of abundant uranium, lead and\
              \ molybdenum minerals.\\n\\nThe FISH images taken on tailings samples\
              \ prepared by cell enrichment were of good quality and suitable for\
              \ cell enumeration (Fig. 1). The bacterial cell number in the tailings\
              \ was estimated to be approximately 107 cells/g tailings, assuming the\
              \ cell extraction efficiency to be 10%. Bacteria made up the major component\
              \ of the cells and Archaea were only scarcely detected. We did not detect\
              \ any difference of the cell abundances between the tailings with and\
              \ without revegetation. The bacterial and archaeal cell abundances in\
              \ these tailings is close to those reported for other base metal tailings\
              \ [7, 20]. Fig. 1A representative FISH image (magnification, × 100)\
              \ of the bacterial (green, FITC dyes) and archaeal cells (red, Cy3 dyes)\
              \ detected in the tailing\\n\\n### The community genomics\\n\\nThe analysis\
              \ of 5 Gb of sequenced DNA obtained from the tailing samples resulted\
              \ in 10 genomic bins belonging to eight genera (Table 1). Five of the\
              \ 10 MAGs, Rubrobacter sp., Truepera sp., Thioalkalivibrio sp., Acidimicrobium\
              \ sp. and Rhodomicrobium sp., had high completeness of > 90% and a contamination\
              \ rate of 1.35–4.87%. Our previous studies based on 16S rRNA amplicon\
              \ sequencing showed that these 5 genera on average accounted for > 12%\
              \ of the total communities in the tailings sampled. These 5 MAGs were\
              \ of high quality, which were binned with an N50 of 9307–32,314 bp,\
              \ with the longest contigs ranging between 51,994–209,767 bp and the\
              \ number of coding sequences ranging between 2963 and 4168. Five other\
              \ bins were obtained of a lower quality but with a completeness > 50%.\
              \ These results enabled the metabolic capacities of the communities\
              \ to be determined and these capacities could be related to the tailings’\
              \ bio-weathering. All the microbial genetic features discussed here\
              \ were based on the annotation of contigs with a length > 8000 bp. Restricting\
              \ the analyses to large contigs would serve to minimize system errors\
              \ such as those caused by sequencing and bioinformatic assembly. This\
              \ metagenomic-based analysis allows a comprehensive estimation of the\
              \ community metabolic networks [5]. Additionally, the sequencing depth\
              \ obtained here was much greater than that of previous metagenomic studies\
              \ of other tailings communities [26], which in this instance enabled\
              \ good estimations of the community metabolic capabilities. Table 1General\

              \ the near complete MAGs, Rubrobacter sp., Thioalkalivibrio sp. and\
              \ Thiobacillus sp., were identified to have prominent capacities for\
              \ acquiring energy and stress resistance in the tailing environment\
              \ (Table 2). Rubrobacter sp. had a wide spectrum of genes for utilizing\
              \ polysaccharides and aromatic compounds, such as the pca [27], sal\
              \ [28], cat [29] and bpa [27] operons. This kind of capability would\
              \ be particularly important considering tailings are an oligotrophic\
              \ environment [15], and in this instance, the organic amendment for\
              \ revegetation in the form of woodchips would have caused an increase\
              \ in content of polysaccharides and chitin [30]. However, it is worth\
              \ noting that the N content of the tailings and woodchips was very low,\
              \ which would have impeded the decomposition of the woodchips in the\
              \ long run [31]. Our recent studies report a very slow decomposition\
              \ of litter amendment in the tailings. Nonetheless, the utilization\
              \ of diverse organic molecules such as polysaccharides and aromatic\
              \ compounds may be a vital survival strategy for these microbes after\
              \ depleting easily labile and soluble organic carbon. Table 2Genetic\

              nThe ability of microbes to cope with salinity and metal (loid) stress\
              \ in the tailings was evident in the annotated MAGs. Various genes for\
              \ osmotic stress resistance were detected in the MAGs of Rubrobacter\
              \ sp., Truepera sp., Thioalkalivibrio sp., and Acidimicrobium sp.. These\
              \ included bet and pro systems that code for the choline monooxygenase/betaine\
              \ aldehyde dehydrogenase pathway [27] and for the L-proline glycine\
              \ betaine ABC transport system [28], respectively. Genes coding for\
              \ resistance to all the metals Zn, Cd, As, Cu and Pb were detected in\
              \ all genera. Impressively, multiple copies of czc, encoding for Co-Zn-Cd\
              \ resistance, were frequently detected in one contig (Fig. 3). All the\
              \ MAGs contained both the pco and cop systems for Cu resistance, and\
              \ 6 out of the 8 genera had both the ACR3 and ars systems for As resistance\
              \ (Table 2). The high frequency of these systems emphasizes the importance\
              \ of metal resistance for microbial survival in the tailings [16]. Fig.\

              \ details can be found in the notes of Table 2\\n\\nSulphidic metal\
              \ tailings are an environment where multiple stresses will occur. This\
              \ includes those of oxidative damage (such as from free Fe2+ [32]),\
              \ salinity [29], moisture content changes [34], and extremely high levels\
              \ of heavy metals [33]. The Fenton reaction of intracellular Fe2+ by\
              \ superoxide is fatal to cells [32]. We detected genes for ferroxidase\
              \ (Fig. 4) and superoxide dismutases as well as genes for Fe uptake\
              \ systems (e.g. Fur, pit) in almost all the tailings MAGs. Likely, these\
              \ genes are providing these microorganisms with defenses against oxidative\
              \ stress. Other protection mechanisms like methylglyoxal detoxification\
              \ genes [35] and glutaredoxin genes [36] were also detected in most\
              \ of the MAGs. Fig. 4A Neighbor-Joining tree showing the phylogenetics\
              \ of the ferroxidase genes recovered from the binned genomes in this\

              \ Sulphide oxidation and salinity generation\\n\\nKEGG annotation successfully\
              \ reconstructed the metabolic capacity of sulphide oxidation and nitrogen\
              \ cycling of the microbial consortia, which may be vital for the survival\
              \ of the community via inter-species cooperation (Fig. 5). Two microbial\
              \ pathways for sulphide oxidation, the direct contact pathway and indirect\
              \ pathway [37, 38], may exist in the tailings (Fig. 5). Thioalkalivibrio\
              \ sp., Acidimicrobium sp. and Thiobacillus sp. are well known sulfur\
              \ oxidizers able to respire on sulphides [39, 40], and in this study\
              \ dsr (organized as dsrABCKJOPR) and sox (organized as soxXYZABH) genes\
              \ for sulphur oxidation were found in these three MAGs from the tailings.\
              \ Thioalkalivibrio sp. and Thiobacillus sp. were both found to harbor\
              \ novel conserved genes (Blr3520 genes) annotated for sulfur oxidation\
              \ as well. In addition, msh operons encoding mannose-sensitive haemagglutinin\
              \ (MSHA)-like pilus for cell attachment to substrates [41] were detected\
              \ in the Thioalkalivibrio sp. genome. This indicated the ability of\
              \ Thioalkalivibrio sp. to attach to pyrite surfaces for oxidation activities.\
              \ Microbes can colonize and etch pyrite surfaces directly and oxidize\
              \ the released sulfur, which was recently observed during ferric-catalyzed\
              \ pyrite oxidation [38]. The features detected in the abovementioned\
              \ genomes coincide with this model. It is thus suggested that in the\
              \ oxic layer of the tailings Thioalkalivibrio sp., Acidimicrobium sp.\
              \ and Thiobacillus sp. may colonize and oxidize sulphides particles\
              \ directly, causing mineral dissolution and contributing to the elevated\
              \ levels of salinity and metals in the pore water. Fig. 5A conceptual\
              \ diagram depicting the microbial mediated sulphide oxidation resulting\
              \ salinity and N depletion in the tailings. DMO, direct microbial oxidation;\
              \ IO, inorganic oxidation; IMO, indirect microbial oxidation\\n\\nGenomic\
              \ features detected here also inferred an indirect oxidation of sulphides\
              \ in the tailings through the coupled reactions of ferrous oxidation\
              \ and nitrate reduction which may occur in an anoxic layer. Diverse\
              \ ferroxidases were detected in all the MAGs (Table 2), indicating intensive\
              \ microbial activities to regenerate ferric which is a strong oxidant\
              \ for sulphide dissolution [38]. Additionally, a full set of denitrification\
              \ genes (nar, nir, nor, nos) were detected in the Thioalkalivibrio sp.\
              \ and Thiobacillus sp. MAGs. It has been determined that total nitrogen\
              \ is extremely low (< 0.006%) in the tailings and most of this is in\
              \ the form of microbial biomass (50–100%) [15]. There is the possibility\
              \ that anaerobic microbial sulphide oxidation has occurred here with\
              \ nitrate as electron acceptor. Other studies showed that pyrite minerals\
              \ of nano-size were oxidized by Thiobacillus denitrificans with nitrate\
              \ as electron acceptor [42]. Sulphides in the tailings used in this\
              \ study may favor this indirect pathway due to their texture dominated\
              \ by fine silt when nitrate is present. This claim about the role of\
              \ nitrate in sulfide oxidation requires experimental verification in\
              \ purposely designed physiological tests.\\n\\nNitrogen deficiency is\
              \ a common problem in tailings limiting plant growth, and its microbial\
              \ cycling has not been well studied for neutral/alkaline metal tailings\
              \ [15]. Our results highlight the possibility of nitrate-depletion by\
              \ microbial sulphides oxidation as well as by CO oxidation [33] in the\
              \ tailings. Nitrogen fixing mechanisms in the tailings remains largely\
              \ unknown. The key nitrogen fixing genes were not detected, with only\
              \ nifU present in the Rubrobacter sp. and Acidimicrobium sp. MAGs.\\\
              n\\n## The environment\\n\\nThe tailings studied are basically neutral/alkaline\
              \ in pH and of a high level of residue heavy metals, salinity and sulphidic\
              \ minerals. Salinity and metal release in sulphidic tailings is mostly\
              \ from the coupled weathering of sulphides and carbonates. The microbially-mediated\
              \ and chemical-mediated weathering of sulphides would have both occurred\
              \ in the amended and revegetated tailings [15]. The microbial processes\
              \ may become as important as the chemical weathering processes in neutral/alkaline\
              \ sulphidic tailings, where the redox potential of oxygen and ferric\
              \ is reduced by the high pH and ferrous can be oxidized more easily\
              \ with diverse electron-acceptors (e.g. nitrate) [25]. Moreover, increased\
              \ nutrients supplied from the organic matter amendment and plant roots,\
              \ as indicated by our previous studies, is very likely resulting in\
              \ increased activities of the sulphide weathering microorganisms [6].\\\
              n\\n## Cell abundance in the tailings\\n\\nCell abundance in the tailings\
              \ was enumerated using conventional FISH. We examined samples by FISH\
              \ that were prepared as either sterilized raw tailings, the raw tailings\
              \ or a cell enrichment obtained from the tailings by sucrose density\
              \ gradient centrifugation. Strong background fluorescence was observed\
              \ and direct observation of cell fluorescence was impossible for raw\
              \ tailings materials. Background fluorescence is a common problem for\
              \ cell enumeration in soil-like materials using FISH, and can be strong\
              \ in metal tailings due to the presence of abundant uranium, lead and\
              \ molybdenum minerals.\\n\\nThe FISH images taken on tailings samples\
              \ prepared by cell enrichment were of good quality and suitable for\
              \ cell enumeration (Fig. 1). The bacterial cell number in the tailings\
              \ was estimated to be approximately 107 cells/g tailings, assuming the\
              \ cell extraction efficiency to be 10%. Bacteria made up the major component\
              \ of the cells and Archaea were only scarcely detected. We did not detect\
              \ any difference of the cell abundances between the tailings with and\
              \ without revegetation. The bacterial and archaeal cell abundances in\
              \ these tailings is close to those reported for other base metal tailings\
              \ [7, 20]. Fig. 1A representative FISH image (magnification, × 100)\
              \ of the bacterial (green, FITC dyes) and archaeal cells (red, Cy3 dyes)\
              \ detected in the tailing\\n\\n## The community genomics\\n\\nThe analysis\
              \ of 5 Gb of sequenced DNA obtained from the tailing samples resulted\
              \ in 10 genomic bins belonging to eight genera (Table 1). Five of the\
              \ 10 MAGs, Rubrobacter sp., Truepera sp., Thioalkalivibrio sp., Acidimicrobium\
              \ sp. and Rhodomicrobium sp., had high completeness of > 90% and a contamination\
              \ rate of 1.35–4.87%. Our previous studies based on 16S rRNA amplicon\
              \ sequencing showed that these 5 genera on average accounted for > 12%\
              \ of the total communities in the tailings sampled. These 5 MAGs were\
              \ of high quality, which were binned with an N50 of 9307–32,314 bp,\
              \ with the longest contigs ranging between 51,994–209,767 bp and the\
              \ number of coding sequences ranging between 2963 and 4168. Five other\
              \ bins were obtained of a lower quality but with a completeness > 50%.\
              \ These results enabled the metabolic capacities of the communities\
              \ to be determined and these capacities could be related to the tailings’\
              \ bio-weathering. All the microbial genetic features discussed here\
              \ were based on the annotation of contigs with a length > 8000 bp. Restricting\
              \ the analyses to large contigs would serve to minimize system errors\
              \ such as those caused by sequencing and bioinformatic assembly. This\
              \ metagenomic-based analysis allows a comprehensive estimation of the\
              \ community metabolic networks [5]. Additionally, the sequencing depth\
              \ obtained here was much greater than that of previous metagenomic studies\
              \ of other tailings communities [26], which in this instance enabled\
              \ good estimations of the community metabolic capabilities. Table 1General\

              \ the near complete MAGs, Rubrobacter sp., Thioalkalivibrio sp. and\
              \ Thiobacillus sp., were identified to have prominent capacities for\
              \ acquiring energy and stress resistance in the tailing environment\
              \ (Table 2). Rubrobacter sp. had a wide spectrum of genes for utilizing\
              \ polysaccharides and aromatic compounds, such as the pca [27], sal\
              \ [28], cat [29] and bpa [27] operons. This kind of capability would\
              \ be particularly important considering tailings are an oligotrophic\
              \ environment [15], and in this instance, the organic amendment for\
              \ revegetation in the form of woodchips would have caused an increase\
              \ in content of polysaccharides and chitin [30]. However, it is worth\
              \ noting that the N content of the tailings and woodchips was very low,\
              \ which would have impeded the decomposition of the woodchips in the\
              \ long run [31]. Our recent studies report a very slow decomposition\
              \ of litter amendment in the tailings. Nonetheless, the utilization\
              \ of diverse organic molecules such as polysaccharides and aromatic\
              \ compounds may be a vital survival strategy for these microbes after\
              \ depleting easily labile and soluble organic carbon. Table 2Genetic\

              \ (Fig. 2). The findings imply these genera can utilize atmospheric\

              nThe ability of microbes to cope with salinity and metal (loid) stress\
              \ in the tailings was evident in the annotated MAGs. Various genes for\
              \ osmotic stress resistance were detected in the MAGs of Rubrobacter\
              \ sp., Truepera sp., Thioalkalivibrio sp., and Acidimicrobium sp.. These\
              \ included bet and pro systems that code for the choline monooxygenase/betaine\
              \ aldehyde dehydrogenase pathway [27] and for the L-proline glycine\
              \ betaine ABC transport system [28], respectively. Genes coding for\
              \ resistance to all the metals Zn, Cd, As, Cu and Pb were detected in\
              \ all genera. Impressively, multiple copies of czc, encoding for Co-Zn-Cd\
              \ resistance, were frequently detected in one contig (Fig. 3). All the\
              \ MAGs contained both the pco and cop systems for Cu resistance, and\
              \ 6 out of the 8 genera had both the ACR3 and ars systems for As resistance\
              \ (Table 2). The high frequency of these systems emphasizes the importance\
              \ of metal resistance for microbial survival in the tailings [16]. Fig.\

              \ tailings are an environment where multiple stresses will occur. This\
              \ includes those of oxidative damage (such as from free Fe2+ [32]),\
              \ salinity [29], moisture content changes [34], and extremely high levels\
              \ of heavy metals [33]. The Fenton reaction of intracellular Fe2+ by\
              \ superoxide is fatal to cells [32]. We detected genes for ferroxidase\
              \ (Fig. 4) and superoxide dismutases as well as genes for Fe uptake\
              \ systems (e.g. Fur, pit) in almost all the tailings MAGs. Likely, these\
              \ genes are providing these microorganisms with defenses against oxidative\
              \ stress. Other protection mechanisms like methylglyoxal detoxification\
              \ genes [35] and glutaredoxin genes [36] were also detected in most\
              \ of the MAGs. Fig. 4A Neighbor-Joining tree showing the phylogenetics\

              \ reconstructed the metabolic capacity of sulphide oxidation and nitrogen\
              \ cycling of the microbial consortia, which may be vital for the survival\
              \ of the community via inter-species cooperation (Fig. 5). Two microbial\
              \ pathways for sulphide oxidation, the direct contact pathway and indirect\
              \ pathway [37, 38], may exist in the tailings (Fig. 5). Thioalkalivibrio\
              \ sp., Acidimicrobium sp. and Thiobacillus sp. are well known sulfur\
              \ oxidizers able to respire on sulphides [39, 40], and in this study\
              \ dsr (organized as dsrABCKJOPR) and sox (organized as soxXYZABH) genes\
              \ for sulphur oxidation were found in these three MAGs from the tailings.\
              \ Thioalkalivibrio sp. and Thiobacillus sp. were both found to harbor\
              \ novel conserved genes (Blr3520 genes) annotated for sulfur oxidation\
              \ as well. In addition, msh operons encoding mannose-sensitive haemagglutinin\
              \ (MSHA)-like pilus for cell attachment to substrates [41] were detected\
              \ in the Thioalkalivibrio sp. genome. This indicated the ability of\
              \ Thioalkalivibrio sp. to attach to pyrite surfaces for oxidation activities.\
              \ Microbes can colonize and etch pyrite surfaces directly and oxidize\
              \ the released sulfur, which was recently observed during ferric-catalyzed\
              \ pyrite oxidation [38]. The features detected in the abovementioned\
              \ genomes coincide with this model. It is thus suggested that in the\
              \ oxic layer of the tailings Thioalkalivibrio sp., Acidimicrobium sp.\
              \ and Thiobacillus sp. may colonize and oxidize sulphides particles\
              \ directly, causing mineral dissolution and contributing to the elevated\
              \ levels of salinity and metals in the pore water. Fig. 5A conceptual\

              \ salinity and N depletion in the tailings. DMO, direct microbial oxidation;\
              \ IO, inorganic oxidation; IMO, indirect microbial oxidation\\n\\nGenomic\
              \ features detected here also inferred an indirect oxidation of sulphides\
              \ in the tailings through the coupled reactions of ferrous oxidation\
              \ and nitrate reduction which may occur in an anoxic layer. Diverse\
              \ ferroxidases were detected in all the MAGs (Table 2), indicating intensive\
              \ microbial activities to regenerate ferric which is a strong oxidant\
              \ for sulphide dissolution [38]. Additionally, a full set of denitrification\
              \ genes (nar, nir, nor, nos) were detected in the Thioalkalivibrio sp.\
              \ and Thiobacillus sp. MAGs. It has been determined that total nitrogen\
              \ is extremely low (< 0.006%) in the tailings and most of this is in\
              \ the form of microbial biomass (50–100%) [15]. There is the possibility\
              \ that anaerobic microbial sulphide oxidation has occurred here with\
              \ nitrate as electron acceptor. Other studies showed that pyrite minerals\
              \ of nano-size were oxidized by Thiobacillus denitrificans with nitrate\
              \ as electron acceptor [42]. Sulphides in the tailings used in this\
              \ study may favor this indirect pathway due to their texture dominated\
              \ by fine silt when nitrate is present. This claim about the role of\
              \ nitrate in sulfide oxidation requires experimental verification in\
              \ purposely designed physiological tests.\\n\\nNitrogen deficiency is\
              \ a common problem in tailings limiting plant growth, and its microbial\
              \ cycling has not been well studied for neutral/alkaline metal tailings\
              \ [15]. Our results highlight the possibility of nitrate-depletion by\
              \ microbial sulphides oxidation as well as by CO oxidation [33] in the\
              \ tailings. Nitrogen fixing mechanisms in the tailings remains largely\
              \ unknown. The key nitrogen fixing genes were not detected, with only\
              \ nifU present in the Rubrobacter sp. and Acidimicrobium sp. MAGs.\\\

              BackgroundMine tailings are hostile environment. It has been well documented\
              \ that several microbes can inhabit such environment, and metagenomic\
              \ reconstruction has successfully pinpointed their activities and community\
              \ structure in acidic tailings environments. We still know little about\
              \ the microbial metabolic capacities of alkaline sulphidic environment\
              \ where microbial processes are critically important for the revegetation.\
              \ Microbial communities therein may not only provide soil functions,\
              \ but also ameliorate the environment stresses for plants’ survival.ResultsIn\
              \ this study, we detected a considerable amount of viable bacterial\
              \ and archaeal cells using fluorescent in situ hybridization in alkaline\
              \ sulphidic tailings from Mt Isa, Queensland. By taking advantage of\
              \ high-throughput sequencing and up-to-date metagenomic binning technology,\
              \ we reconstructed the microbial community structure and potential coupled\
              \ iron and nitrogen metabolism pathways in the tailings. Assembly of\
              \ 10 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), with 5 nearly complete, was\
              \ achieved. From this, detailed insights into the community metabolic\
              \ capabilities was derived. Dominant microbial species were seen to\
              \ possess powerful resistance systems for osmotic, metal and oxidative\
              \ stresses. Additionally, these community members had metabolic capabilities\
              \ for sulphide oxidation, for causing increased salinity and metal release,\
              \ and for leading to N depletion.ConclusionsHere our results show that\
              \ a considerable amount of microbial cells inhabit the mine tailings,\
              \ who possess a variety of genes for stress response. Metabolic reconstruction\
              \ infers that the microbial consortia may actively accelerate the sulphide\
              \ weathering and N depletion therein.\",\n    \"introduction\": \"IntroductionMine\
              \ tailings are milled residue wastes of ore processing. Those of metal\
              \ mines, typically Pb/Zn/Cu/Ni, always contain abundant sulphides that\
              \ are mostly pyrite based, e.g. FeS2. Due to the high reactivity of\
              \ sulphides, high levels of metals and salinity can be generated by\
              \ the coupled weathering of sulphide and carbonate wastes [1]. This\
              \ makes mine tailings a rather hostile environment to microbes, while\
              \ still a considerable amount cells, though with a relatively low diversity\
              \ compared with normal soils, had been detected therein [1]. The contribution\
              \ of microbial activities to the weathering of sulphides has long been\
              \ recognized in mine tailings. At the acid mine drainage (AMD) site\
              \ of Iron Mountain, Calif., Thiobacillus ferrooxidans and Leptospirillum\
              \ ferrooxidans were found to be dominant in the community and contribute\
              \ to the generation of AMD [2]. In a copper bioleaching heap, sulfurophilic\
              \ and iron-ophilic acidophilic bacteria were found to actively colonize\
              \ the mineral surface [3]. These microbes show adaptability to extremely\
              \ acidic environment and play an important role in the sustainability\
              \ of this system. With the advent of the modern molecular tools, community\
              \ genomics of microbial consortia in acid mine environments has been\
              \ well explored [4, 5], while that of alkaline mine tailings has not\
              \ been extensively studied. Alkaline mine environment is normally subjected\
              \ to revegetation which requires the establishment of soil function\
              \ including microbial diversity [6].Microbial community networks related\
              \ to sulphide weathering in neutralized tailings have been determined\
              \ [7, 8], yet these studies are based on mainly 16S rRNA gene detection\
              \ and then possible functions of the community members are inferred\
              \ from physiological information of known related pure cultures. This\
              \ approach is useful but is highly limited and speculative with regard\
              \ to approximating the community metabolic capabilities related to the\
              \ in situ elemental cycling and adaptation strategies. In contrast,\
              \ metagenome-based analyses enable reconstruction of nearly complete\
              \ genomes of microbial community members. Such analyses provides detailed\
              \ insights of metabolic capabilities and enables estimating the possible\
              \ contributions of populations to the community processes [5]. Metagenomic\
              \ approaches have been successfully used to resolve the microbial biogeochemical\
              \ potential in saline sea water [9, 10], and to reconstruct microbial\
              \ metabolism in AMD. It is found that acidophilic bacteria community\
              \ in AMD has a microbial diversity higher than expected [11, 12]. Recently,\
              \ draft genomes acquired through metagenomics have been used to understand\
              \ the bacterial colonization of the infant gut [13] and microbial systems\

              \ Queensland. Microbial metabolic capabilities for stress resistance\
              \ and elemental cycling were implied through the annotation of 10 metagenome-assembled\
              \ genomes (MAGs) from the tailings metagenomes. The results may provide\
              \ further understanding on biogeochemistry of alkaline sulphidic tailings\

        text: "Based on PMID 33926573, **yes, microbes from alkaline sulphidic tailings\
          \ do show evidence of oxidative stress responses**. \n\n## Key Evidence\
          \ from the Study:\n\n### 1. **Extensive Oxidative Stress Response Systems\
          \ Detected**\nThe study found that dominant microbial species in the alkaline\
          \ sulphidic tailings possessed **powerful resistance systems for oxidative\
          \ stresses**. Specifically, the researchers detected multiple oxidative\
          \ stress response genes across the analyzed microorganisms:\n\n- **Glutathione\
          \ S-transferase genes (GT)** - found in 5/8 genera\n- **Methylglyoxal detoxification\
          \ genes (Glo)** - found in 7/8 genera  \n- **SAM-dependent methyltransferase\
          \ genes (SAM)** - found in 2/8 genera\n- **Ferroxidase genes (Fr)** - found\
          \ in 8/8 genera\n- **Oxidative stress response genes (NO)** - found in 3/8\
          \ genera\n- **Superoxide dismutase genes (SOD)** - found in 7/8 genera\n\
          \n### 2. **Environmental Sources of Oxidative Stress**\nThe study explains\
          \ why these microbes need such extensive oxidative stress defenses:\n\n\
          - **Iron-mediated oxidative damage**: The Fenton reaction of intracellular\
          \ Fe²⁺ with superoxide is described as \"fatal to cells\"\n- **High metal\
          \ content**: The tailings contain ~1300 mg/kg Cu, ~1800 mg/kg Pb, and ~2900\
          \ mg/kg Zn\n- **Sulphide weathering processes**: Generate reactive species\
          \ that can cause oxidative damage\n\n### 3. **Specific Protective Mechanisms**\n\
          The researchers identified several key protective strategies:\n\n- **Iron\
          \ homeostasis**: Genes for iron uptake systems (pit, SDP, efu) and ferroxidases\
          \ to manage iron levels\n- **Antioxidant enzymes**: Superoxide dismutases\
          \ to neutralize superoxide radicals\n- **Detoxification systems**: Methylglyoxal\
          \ detoxification and glutaredoxin systems\n- **Cellular protection**: Glutathione\
          \ S-transferases for general oxidative protection\n\n### **Important Note:\
          \ Retracted Publication**\nIt's crucial to note that this paper has been\
          \ **retracted** (as indicated in the metadata: \"Retracted Publication\"\
          \ and reference to retraction in 2024). Therefore, while the findings suggest\
          \ oxidative stress responses in alkaline sulphidic tailings microbes, these\
          \ results should be interpreted with caution and additional independent\
          \ studies would be needed to confirm these findings.\n\nThe evidence presented\
          \ in the original study strongly suggested that microbes in alkaline sulphidic\
          \ tailings environments do indeed experience and respond to significant\
          \ oxidative stresses through multiple sophisticated molecular mechanisms."

        n\\nMine tailings are milled residue wastes of ore processing. Those of metal\
        \ mines, typically Pb/Zn/Cu/Ni, always contain abundant sulphides that are\
        \ mostly pyrite based, e.g. FeS2. Due to the high reactivity of sulphides,\
        \ high levels of metals and salinity can be generated by the coupled weathering\
        \ of sulphide and carbonate wastes [1]. This makes mine tailings a rather\
        \ hostile environment to microbes, while still a considerable amount cells,\
        \ though with a relatively low diversity compared with normal soils, had been\
        \ detected therein [1]. The contribution of microbial activities to the weathering\
        \ of sulphides has long been recognized in mine tailings. At the acid mine\
        \ drainage (AMD) site of Iron Mountain, Calif., Thiobacillus ferrooxidans\
        \ and Leptospirillum ferrooxidans were found to be dominant in the community\
        \ and contribute to the generation of AMD [2]. In a copper bioleaching heap,\
        \ sulfurophilic and iron-ophilic acidophilic bacteria were found to actively\
        \ colonize the mineral surface [3]. These microbes show adaptability to extremely\
        \ acidic environment and play an important role in the sustainability of this\
        \ system. With the advent of the modern molecular tools, community genomics\
        \ of microbial consortia in acid mine environments has been well explored\
        \ [4, 5], while that of alkaline mine tailings has not been extensively studied.\
        \ Alkaline mine environment is normally subjected to revegetation which requires\
        \ the establishment of soil function including microbial diversity [6].\\\
        n\\nMicrobial community networks related to sulphide weathering in neutralized\
        \ tailings have been determined [7, 8], yet these studies are based on mainly\
        \ 16S rRNA gene detection and then possible functions of the community members\
        \ are inferred from physiological information of known related pure cultures.\
        \ This approach is useful but is highly limited and speculative with regard\
        \ to approximating the community metabolic capabilities related to the in\
        \ situ elemental cycling and adaptation strategies. In contrast, metagenome-based\
        \ analyses enable reconstruction of nearly complete genomes of microbial community\
        \ members. Such analyses provides detailed insights of metabolic capabilities\
        \ and enables estimating the possible contributions of populations to the\
        \ community processes [5]. Metagenomic approaches have been successfully used\
        \ to resolve the microbial biogeochemical potential in saline sea water [9,\
        \ 10], and to reconstruct microbial metabolism in AMD. It is found that acidophilic\
        \ bacteria community in AMD has a microbial diversity higher than expected\
        \ [11, 12]. Recently, draft genomes acquired through metagenomics have been\
        \ used to understand the bacterial colonization of the infant gut [13] and\
        \ microbial systems in hypersaline lakes [14].\\n\\nIn this study, we analyzed\
        \ metagenomes of alkaline sulphidic tailings from a tailings storage facility\
        \ of northwest Queensland. Microbial metabolic capabilities for stress resistance\
        \ and elemental cycling were implied through the annotation of 10 metagenome-assembled\
        \ genomes (MAGs) from the tailings metagenomes. The results may provide further\
        \ understanding on biogeochemistry of alkaline sulphidic tailings and valuable\
        \ inference for tailings revegetation practice.\\n\\n## Materials and methods\\\
        n\\n### Sampling\\n\\nSampling sites and methods have been described in our\
        \ previous studies [15, 16]. Briefly, base metal mine tailings were sampled\
        \ from a storage facility Mt Isa, northwest Queensland. The microbial community\
        \ structure based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing related to revegetation has\
        \ been determined and described elsewhere. The tailings mainly comprise of\
        \ quartz, dolomite, pyrite, gypsum and kaolinite, and contain approximately\
        \ 1300, 1800 and 2900 mg/kg of residue Cu, Pb and Zn, respectively. The 16S-based\
        \ amplicon sequencing reveals that the dominant microbial species in the tailings\
        \ include Rubrobacter spp. of the Actinobacteria, Truepera spp. of the Deinococcus-Thermus,\
        \ and Thioalkalivibrio spp. and Thiobacillus spp. of the Proteobacteria. No\
        \ substantial changes were detected of the microbial community structure in\
        \ summer and in winter [6], and dominant species changed little in spite of\
        \ significant increases in diversity detected along with the revegetation\
        \ efforts [15].\\n\\n### Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH)\\n\\nCells\
        \ from the tailings samples were firstly enriched by a sucrose density centrifugation\
        \ [17], followed by the standard FISH procedure for soil with minor modifications\
        \ [18, 19]. To obtain sufficient microbial cells from the tailings, quadruplicates\
        \ with 5 g of tailings each were used for cell enrichment. Oligonucleotide\
        \ probes were used for detecting bacteria (mixed EUB338) and archaea (ARCH915)\
        \ [20]. The hybridized samples were observed within 24 h of performing the\
        \ FISH and images were taken using a ZEISS LSM 510 META Confocal Microscope.\
        \ For enumeration of microorganisms, from each sample a total of 30 confocal\
        \ acquisitions were taken, and 21 quality images were used to determine the\
        \ cell abundances using DAIME 1.3 [21].\\n\\n### DNA extraction and sequencing\\\
        n\\nDNA extraction was done using the PowerSoil® DNA Isolation Kit (MO BIO\
        \ Laboratories, Inc.), after cell enrichment using the previously described\
        \ protocol [17]. A total of seven DNA samples of tailings samples were subjected\
        \ to shotgun sequencing. The sequencing was done at the Institute for Molecular\
        \ Bioscience, The University of Queensland, using Illumina MiSeq with paired-end\
        \ 300 bp reads. The detailed sequencing method is described in our previous\
        \ study [16].\\n\\n### Bioinformatics\\n\\nFor the purpose of high quality\
        \ assembly of the metagenome, the seven metagenomes were pooled together and\
        \ analyzed using the flexible pipeline MetaWRAP [22] for genome-resolved metagenomic\
        \ data analysis. The assembly module was used for sequence assembly. The assembly\
        \ contigs obtained were all longer than 1000 bp. The workflow of MaxBin2 in\
        \ MetaWRAP was used for contig encapsulation. MetaWRAP provides three assembly\
        \ pipelines, namely Concoct, Metabat2 and Maxbin2, and after comparison Maxbin2\
        \ was chose for subsequent analysis [23]. Then the obtained bins were further\
        \ analyzed for species annotation. Species annotation was performed in the\
        \ annotate_bins module, based on the NCBI_nt and NCBI_tax databases. Taxator-tk\
        \ was used for the classification of each contig, and a bin as a whole was\
        \ estimated to annotate species. CheckM was used for the quality assessment\
        \ of the assembled bins (MAGs; https://ecogenomics.github.io/CheckM/). For\
        \ gene annotation, a cutoff E value of 10− 6 and an identity of 70% were used.\
        \ Metawrap was run on a 42-core, 192 GB RAM server. Bins were then used for\
        \ microbial metabolic pathway analysis using the online analysis platform\
        \ KEGG [24].\\n\\n## Sampling\\n\\nSampling sites and methods have been described\

        \ KEGG [24].\\n\\n## Results and discussion\\n\\n### The environment\\n\\\
        nThe tailings studied are basically neutral/alkaline in pH and of a high level\
        \ of residue heavy metals, salinity and sulphidic minerals. Salinity and metal\
        \ release in sulphidic tailings is mostly from the coupled weathering of sulphides\
        \ and carbonates. The microbially-mediated and chemical-mediated weathering\
        \ of sulphides would have both occurred in the amended and revegetated tailings\
        \ [15]. The microbial processes may become as important as the chemical weathering\
        \ processes in neutral/alkaline sulphidic tailings, where the redox potential\
        \ of oxygen and ferric is reduced by the high pH and ferrous can be oxidized\
        \ more easily with diverse electron-acceptors (e.g. nitrate) [25]. Moreover,\
        \ increased nutrients supplied from the organic matter amendment and plant\
        \ roots, as indicated by our previous studies, is very likely resulting in\
        \ increased activities of the sulphide weathering microorganisms [6].\\n\\\
        n### Cell abundance in the tailings\\n\\nCell abundance in the tailings was\
        \ enumerated using conventional FISH. We examined samples by FISH that were\
        \ prepared as either sterilized raw tailings, the raw tailings or a cell enrichment\
        \ obtained from the tailings by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Strong\
        \ background fluorescence was observed and direct observation of cell fluorescence\
        \ was impossible for raw tailings materials. Background fluorescence is a\
        \ common problem for cell enumeration in soil-like materials using FISH, and\
        \ can be strong in metal tailings due to the presence of abundant uranium,\
        \ lead and molybdenum minerals.\\n\\nThe FISH images taken on tailings samples\
        \ prepared by cell enrichment were of good quality and suitable for cell enumeration\
        \ (Fig. 1). The bacterial cell number in the tailings was estimated to be\
        \ approximately 107 cells/g tailings, assuming the cell extraction efficiency\
        \ to be 10%. Bacteria made up the major component of the cells and Archaea\
        \ were only scarcely detected. We did not detect any difference of the cell\
        \ abundances between the tailings with and without revegetation. The bacterial\
        \ and archaeal cell abundances in these tailings is close to those reported\
        \ for other base metal tailings [7, 20]. Fig. 1A representative FISH image\
        \ (magnification, × 100) of the bacterial (green, FITC dyes) and archaeal\
        \ cells (red, Cy3 dyes) detected in the tailing\\n\\n### The community genomics\\\
        n\\nThe analysis of 5 Gb of sequenced DNA obtained from the tailing samples\
        \ resulted in 10 genomic bins belonging to eight genera (Table 1). Five of\
        \ the 10 MAGs, Rubrobacter sp., Truepera sp., Thioalkalivibrio sp., Acidimicrobium\
        \ sp. and Rhodomicrobium sp., had high completeness of > 90% and a contamination\
        \ rate of 1.35–4.87%. Our previous studies based on 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing\
        \ showed that these 5 genera on average accounted for > 12% of the total communities\
        \ in the tailings sampled. These 5 MAGs were of high quality, which were binned\
        \ with an N50 of 9307–32,314 bp, with the longest contigs ranging between\
        \ 51,994–209,767 bp and the number of coding sequences ranging between 2963\
        \ and 4168. Five other bins were obtained of a lower quality but with a completeness\

        \ may have found niches within the tailings by consuming sulphides and respiring\

        \ genes in their binned MAGs. Interestingly, Rubrobacter sp. and Acidimicrobium\
        \ sp. were found to have cox operons for CO oxidation, inferring an ability\
        \ to respire on CO. CO utilization has been documented for many microbes residing\
        \ in saline environments, such as in seawater [32] and saline soils [33].\
        \ In addition, four out of the eight genera were found to contain genes for\
        \ CO2 fixation, in the form of a minimum set of cbbLSX [34] (Fig. 2). The\
        \ findings imply these genera can utilize atmospheric carbon sources, and\

        \ the environment\\n\\nThe ability of microbes to cope with salinity and metal\
        \ (loid) stress in the tailings was evident in the annotated MAGs. Various\
        \ genes for osmotic stress resistance were detected in the MAGs of Rubrobacter\
        \ sp., Truepera sp., Thioalkalivibrio sp., and Acidimicrobium sp.. These included\
        \ bet and pro systems that code for the choline monooxygenase/betaine aldehyde\
        \ dehydrogenase pathway [27] and for the L-proline glycine betaine ABC transport\
        \ system [28], respectively. Genes coding for resistance to all the metals\
        \ Zn, Cd, As, Cu and Pb were detected in all genera. Impressively, multiple\
        \ copies of czc, encoding for Co-Zn-Cd resistance, were frequently detected\
        \ in one contig (Fig. 3). All the MAGs contained both the pco and cop systems\
        \ for Cu resistance, and 6 out of the 8 genera had both the ACR3 and ars systems\
        \ for As resistance (Table 2). The high frequency of these systems emphasizes\
        \ the importance of metal resistance for microbial survival in the tailings\
        \ [16]. Fig. 3Gene clusters for metal resistance found in the binned genomes\

        \ 2\\n\\nSulphidic metal tailings are an environment where multiple stresses\
        \ will occur. This includes those of oxidative damage (such as from free Fe2+\
        \ [32]), salinity [29], moisture content changes [34], and extremely high\
        \ levels of heavy metals [33]. The Fenton reaction of intracellular Fe2+ by\
        \ superoxide is fatal to cells [32]. We detected genes for ferroxidase (Fig.\
        \ 4) and superoxide dismutases as well as genes for Fe uptake systems (e.g.\
        \ Fur, pit) in almost all the tailings MAGs. Likely, these genes are providing\
        \ these microorganisms with defenses against oxidative stress. Other protection\
        \ mechanisms like methylglyoxal detoxification genes [35] and glutaredoxin\
        \ genes [36] were also detected in most of the MAGs. Fig. 4A Neighbor-Joining\
        \ tree showing the phylogenetics of the ferroxidase genes recovered from the\
        \ binned genomes in this study. The tree was constructed using MEGA 6.06 based\
        \ on the sequence alignment using the CLUSTAL method with default parameters\\\
        n\\n### Sulphide oxidation and salinity generation\\n\\nKEGG annotation successfully\
        \ reconstructed the metabolic capacity of sulphide oxidation and nitrogen\
        \ cycling of the microbial consortia, which may be vital for the survival\
        \ of the community via inter-species cooperation (Fig. 5). Two microbial pathways\
        \ for sulphide oxidation, the direct contact pathway and indirect pathway\
        \ [37, 38], may exist in the tailings (Fig. 5). Thioalkalivibrio sp., Acidimicrobium\
        \ sp. and Thiobacillus sp. are well known sulfur oxidizers able to respire\
        \ on sulphides [39, 40], and in this study dsr (organized as dsrABCKJOPR)\
        \ and sox (organized as soxXYZABH) genes for sulphur oxidation were found\
        \ in these three MAGs from the tailings. Thioalkalivibrio sp. and Thiobacillus\
        \ sp. were both found to harbor novel conserved genes (Blr3520 genes) annotated\
        \ for sulfur oxidation as well. In addition, msh operons encoding mannose-sensitive\
        \ haemagglutinin (MSHA)-like pilus for cell attachment to substrates [41]\
        \ were detected in the Thioalkalivibrio sp. genome. This indicated the ability\
        \ of Thioalkalivibrio sp. to attach to pyrite surfaces for oxidation activities.\
        \ Microbes can colonize and etch pyrite surfaces directly and oxidize the\
        \ released sulfur, which was recently observed during ferric-catalyzed pyrite\
        \ oxidation [38]. The features detected in the abovementioned genomes coincide\
        \ with this model. It is thus suggested that in the oxic layer of the tailings\
        \ Thioalkalivibrio sp., Acidimicrobium sp. and Thiobacillus sp. may colonize\
        \ and oxidize sulphides particles directly, causing mineral dissolution and\
        \ contributing to the elevated levels of salinity and metals in the pore water.\
        \ Fig. 5A conceptual diagram depicting the microbial mediated sulphide oxidation\
        \ resulting salinity and N depletion in the tailings. DMO, direct microbial\
        \ oxidation; IO, inorganic oxidation; IMO, indirect microbial oxidation\\\
        n\\nGenomic features detected here also inferred an indirect oxidation of\
        \ sulphides in the tailings through the coupled reactions of ferrous oxidation\
        \ and nitrate reduction which may occur in an anoxic layer. Diverse ferroxidases\
        \ were detected in all the MAGs (Table 2), indicating intensive microbial\
        \ activities to regenerate ferric which is a strong oxidant for sulphide dissolution\
        \ [38]. Additionally, a full set of denitrification genes (nar, nir, nor,\
        \ nos) were detected in the Thioalkalivibrio sp. and Thiobacillus sp. MAGs.\
        \ It has been determined that total nitrogen is extremely low (< 0.006%) in\
        \ the tailings and most of this is in the form of microbial biomass (50–100%)\
        \ [15]. There is the possibility that anaerobic microbial sulphide oxidation\
        \ has occurred here with nitrate as electron acceptor. Other studies showed\
        \ that pyrite minerals of nano-size were oxidized by Thiobacillus denitrificans\
        \ with nitrate as electron acceptor [42]. Sulphides in the tailings used in\
        \ this study may favor this indirect pathway due to their texture dominated\
        \ by fine silt when nitrate is present. This claim about the role of nitrate\
        \ in sulfide oxidation requires experimental verification in purposely designed\
        \ physiological tests.\\n\\nNitrogen deficiency is a common problem in tailings\
        \ limiting plant growth, and its microbial cycling has not been well studied\
        \ for neutral/alkaline metal tailings [15]. Our results highlight the possibility\
        \ of nitrate-depletion by microbial sulphides oxidation as well as by CO oxidation\
        \ [33] in the tailings. Nitrogen fixing mechanisms in the tailings remains\
        \ largely unknown. The key nitrogen fixing genes were not detected, with only\
        \ nifU present in the Rubrobacter sp. and Acidimicrobium sp. MAGs.\\n\\n##\
        \ The environment\\n\\nThe tailings studied are basically neutral/alkaline\
        \ in pH and of a high level of residue heavy metals, salinity and sulphidic\
        \ minerals. Salinity and metal release in sulphidic tailings is mostly from\
        \ the coupled weathering of sulphides and carbonates. The microbially-mediated\
        \ and chemical-mediated weathering of sulphides would have both occurred in\
        \ the amended and revegetated tailings [15]. The microbial processes may become\
        \ as important as the chemical weathering processes in neutral/alkaline sulphidic\
        \ tailings, where the redox potential of oxygen and ferric is reduced by the\
        \ high pH and ferrous can be oxidized more easily with diverse electron-acceptors\
        \ (e.g. nitrate) [25]. Moreover, increased nutrients supplied from the organic\
        \ matter amendment and plant roots, as indicated by our previous studies,\
        \ is very likely resulting in increased activities of the sulphide weathering\
        \ microorganisms [6].\\n\\n## Cell abundance in the tailings\\n\\nCell abundance\
        \ in the tailings was enumerated using conventional FISH. We examined samples\
        \ by FISH that were prepared as either sterilized raw tailings, the raw tailings\
        \ or a cell enrichment obtained from the tailings by sucrose density gradient\
        \ centrifugation. Strong background fluorescence was observed and direct observation\
        \ of cell fluorescence was impossible for raw tailings materials. Background\
        \ fluorescence is a common problem for cell enumeration in soil-like materials\
        \ using FISH, and can be strong in metal tailings due to the presence of abundant\
        \ uranium, lead and molybdenum minerals.\\n\\nThe FISH images taken on tailings\
        \ samples prepared by cell enrichment were of good quality and suitable for\
        \ cell enumeration (Fig. 1). The bacterial cell number in the tailings was\
        \ estimated to be approximately 107 cells/g tailings, assuming the cell extraction\
        \ efficiency to be 10%. Bacteria made up the major component of the cells\
        \ and Archaea were only scarcely detected. We did not detect any difference\
        \ of the cell abundances between the tailings with and without revegetation.\
        \ The bacterial and archaeal cell abundances in these tailings is close to\
        \ those reported for other base metal tailings [7, 20]. Fig. 1A representative\
        \ FISH image (magnification, × 100) of the bacterial (green, FITC dyes) and\
        \ archaeal cells (red, Cy3 dyes) detected in the tailing\\n\\n## The community\
        \ genomics\\n\\nThe analysis of 5 Gb of sequenced DNA obtained from the tailing\
        \ samples resulted in 10 genomic bins belonging to eight genera (Table 1).\
        \ Five of the 10 MAGs, Rubrobacter sp., Truepera sp., Thioalkalivibrio sp.,\
        \ Acidimicrobium sp. and Rhodomicrobium sp., had high completeness of > 90%\
        \ and a contamination rate of 1.35–4.87%. Our previous studies based on 16S\
        \ rRNA amplicon sequencing showed that these 5 genera on average accounted\
        \ for > 12% of the total communities in the tailings sampled. These 5 MAGs\
        \ were of high quality, which were binned with an N50 of 9307–32,314 bp, with\
        \ the longest contigs ranging between 51,994–209,767 bp and the number of\
        \ coding sequences ranging between 2963 and 4168. Five other bins were obtained\
        \ of a lower quality but with a completeness > 50%. These results enabled\
        \ the metabolic capacities of the communities to be determined and these capacities\
        \ could be related to the tailings’ bio-weathering. All the microbial genetic\
        \ features discussed here were based on the annotation of contigs with a length\
        \ > 8000 bp. Restricting the analyses to large contigs would serve to minimize\
        \ system errors such as those caused by sequencing and bioinformatic assembly.\
        \ This metagenomic-based analysis allows a comprehensive estimation of the\
        \ community metabolic networks [5]. Additionally, the sequencing depth obtained\
        \ here was much greater than that of previous metagenomic studies of other\
        \ tailings communities [26], which in this instance enabled good estimations\

        \ In addition, four out of the eight genera were found to contain genes for\

        \ the environment\\n\\nThe ability of microbes to cope with salinity and metal\
        \ (loid) stress in the tailings was evident in the annotated MAGs. Various\
        \ genes for osmotic stress resistance were detected in the MAGs of Rubrobacter\
        \ sp., Truepera sp., Thioalkalivibrio sp., and Acidimicrobium sp.. These included\
        \ bet and pro systems that code for the choline monooxygenase/betaine aldehyde\
        \ dehydrogenase pathway [27] and for the L-proline glycine betaine ABC transport\
        \ system [28], respectively. Genes coding for resistance to all the metals\
        \ Zn, Cd, As, Cu and Pb were detected in all genera. Impressively, multiple\
        \ copies of czc, encoding for Co-Zn-Cd resistance, were frequently detected\
        \ in one contig (Fig. 3). All the MAGs contained both the pco and cop systems\
        \ for Cu resistance, and 6 out of the 8 genera had both the ACR3 and ars systems\
        \ for As resistance (Table 2). The high frequency of these systems emphasizes\
        \ the importance of metal resistance for microbial survival in the tailings\
        \ [16]. Fig. 3Gene clusters for metal resistance found in the binned genomes\

        \ will occur. This includes those of oxidative damage (such as from free Fe2+\
        \ [32]), salinity [29], moisture content changes [34], and extremely high\
        \ levels of heavy metals [33]. The Fenton reaction of intracellular Fe2+ by\
        \ superoxide is fatal to cells [32]. We detected genes for ferroxidase (Fig.\
        \ 4) and superoxide dismutases as well as genes for Fe uptake systems (e.g.\
        \ Fur, pit) in almost all the tailings MAGs. Likely, these genes are providing\
        \ these microorganisms with defenses against oxidative stress. Other protection\
        \ mechanisms like methylglyoxal detoxification genes [35] and glutaredoxin\
        \ genes [36] were also detected in most of the MAGs. Fig. 4A Neighbor-Joining\

        n\\n## Sulphide oxidation and salinity generation\\n\\nKEGG annotation successfully\
        \ reconstructed the metabolic capacity of sulphide oxidation and nitrogen\
        \ cycling of the microbial consortia, which may be vital for the survival\
        \ of the community via inter-species cooperation (Fig. 5). Two microbial pathways\
        \ for sulphide oxidation, the direct contact pathway and indirect pathway\
        \ [37, 38], may exist in the tailings (Fig. 5). Thioalkalivibrio sp., Acidimicrobium\
        \ sp. and Thiobacillus sp. are well known sulfur oxidizers able to respire\
        \ on sulphides [39, 40], and in this study dsr (organized as dsrABCKJOPR)\
        \ and sox (organized as soxXYZABH) genes for sulphur oxidation were found\
        \ in these three MAGs from the tailings. Thioalkalivibrio sp. and Thiobacillus\
        \ sp. were both found to harbor novel conserved genes (Blr3520 genes) annotated\
        \ for sulfur oxidation as well. In addition, msh operons encoding mannose-sensitive\
        \ haemagglutinin (MSHA)-like pilus for cell attachment to substrates [41]\
        \ were detected in the Thioalkalivibrio sp. genome. This indicated the ability\
        \ of Thioalkalivibrio sp. to attach to pyrite surfaces for oxidation activities.\
        \ Microbes can colonize and etch pyrite surfaces directly and oxidize the\
        \ released sulfur, which was recently observed during ferric-catalyzed pyrite\
        \ oxidation [38]. The features detected in the abovementioned genomes coincide\
        \ with this model. It is thus suggested that in the oxic layer of the tailings\
        \ Thioalkalivibrio sp., Acidimicrobium sp. and Thiobacillus sp. may colonize\
        \ and oxidize sulphides particles directly, causing mineral dissolution and\
        \ contributing to the elevated levels of salinity and metals in the pore water.\

        n\\nGenomic features detected here also inferred an indirect oxidation of\
        \ sulphides in the tailings through the coupled reactions of ferrous oxidation\
        \ and nitrate reduction which may occur in an anoxic layer. Diverse ferroxidases\
        \ were detected in all the MAGs (Table 2), indicating intensive microbial\
        \ activities to regenerate ferric which is a strong oxidant for sulphide dissolution\
        \ [38]. Additionally, a full set of denitrification genes (nar, nir, nor,\
        \ nos) were detected in the Thioalkalivibrio sp. and Thiobacillus sp. MAGs.\
        \ It has been determined that total nitrogen is extremely low (< 0.006%) in\
        \ the tailings and most of this is in the form of microbial biomass (50–100%)\
        \ [15]. There is the possibility that anaerobic microbial sulphide oxidation\
        \ has occurred here with nitrate as electron acceptor. Other studies showed\
        \ that pyrite minerals of nano-size were oxidized by Thiobacillus denitrificans\
        \ with nitrate as electron acceptor [42]. Sulphides in the tailings used in\
        \ this study may favor this indirect pathway due to their texture dominated\
        \ by fine silt when nitrate is present. This claim about the role of nitrate\
        \ in sulfide oxidation requires experimental verification in purposely designed\
        \ physiological tests.\\n\\nNitrogen deficiency is a common problem in tailings\
        \ limiting plant growth, and its microbial cycling has not been well studied\
        \ for neutral/alkaline metal tailings [15]. Our results highlight the possibility\
        \ of nitrate-depletion by microbial sulphides oxidation as well as by CO oxidation\
        \ [33] in the tailings. Nitrogen fixing mechanisms in the tailings remains\
        \ largely unknown. The key nitrogen fixing genes were not detected, with only\
        \ nifU present in the Rubrobacter sp. and Acidimicrobium sp. MAGs.\\n\\n\"\

        : \"IntroductionMine tailings are milled residue wastes of ore processing.\
        \ Those of metal mines, typically Pb/Zn/Cu/Ni, always contain abundant sulphides\
        \ that are mostly pyrite based, e.g. FeS2. Due to the high reactivity of sulphides,\
        \ high levels of metals and salinity can be generated by the coupled weathering\
        \ of sulphide and carbonate wastes [1]. This makes mine tailings a rather\
        \ hostile environment to microbes, while still a considerable amount cells,\
        \ though with a relatively low diversity compared with normal soils, had been\
        \ detected therein [1]. The contribution of microbial activities to the weathering\
        \ of sulphides has long been recognized in mine tailings. At the acid mine\
        \ drainage (AMD) site of Iron Mountain, Calif., Thiobacillus ferrooxidans\
        \ and Leptospirillum ferrooxidans were found to be dominant in the community\
        \ and contribute to the generation of AMD [2]. In a copper bioleaching heap,\
        \ sulfurophilic and iron-ophilic acidophilic bacteria were found to actively\
        \ colonize the mineral surface [3]. These microbes show adaptability to extremely\
        \ acidic environment and play an important role in the sustainability of this\
        \ system. With the advent of the modern molecular tools, community genomics\
        \ of microbial consortia in acid mine environments has been well explored\
        \ [4, 5], while that of alkaline mine tailings has not been extensively studied.\
        \ Alkaline mine environment is normally subjected to revegetation which requires\
        \ the establishment of soil function including microbial diversity [6].Microbial\
        \ community networks related to sulphide weathering in neutralized tailings\
        \ have been determined [7, 8], yet these studies are based on mainly 16S rRNA\
        \ gene detection and then possible functions of the community members are\
        \ inferred from physiological information of known related pure cultures.\
        \ This approach is useful but is highly limited and speculative with regard\
        \ to approximating the community metabolic capabilities related to the in\
        \ situ elemental cycling and adaptation strategies. In contrast, metagenome-based\
        \ analyses enable reconstruction of nearly complete genomes of microbial community\
        \ members. Such analyses provides detailed insights of metabolic capabilities\
        \ and enables estimating the possible contributions of populations to the\
        \ community processes [5]. Metagenomic approaches have been successfully used\
        \ to resolve the microbial biogeochemical potential in saline sea water [9,\
        \ 10], and to reconstruct microbial metabolism in AMD. It is found that acidophilic\
        \ bacteria community in AMD has a microbial diversity higher than expected\
        \ [11, 12]. Recently, draft genomes acquired through metagenomics have been\
        \ used to understand the bacterial colonization of the infant gut [13] and\
        \ microbial systems in hypersaline lakes [14].In this study, we analyzed metagenomes\
        \ of alkaline sulphidic tailings from a tailings storage facility of northwest\
        \ Queensland. Microbial metabolic capabilities for stress resistance and elemental\
        \ cycling were implied through the annotation of 10 metagenome-assembled genomes\
        \ (MAGs) from the tailings metagenomes. The results may provide further understanding\
        \ on biogeochemistry of alkaline sulphidic tailings and valuable inference\
        \ for tailings revegetation practice.\",\n    \"methods\": \"Materials and\
