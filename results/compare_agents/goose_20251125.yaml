    a generic message about being unable to retrieve the document. There is no verbatim

              \ definitions of biological complexity have been proposed: the number\
              \ of genes, cell types, or metabolic\\nprocesses within an organism.\
              \ As knowledge of biological systems has increased, it has become apparent\
              \ that these metrics\\nare often incongruent. Methodology. Here we propose\
              \ an alternative complexity metric based on the number of genetically\\\
              nuncorrelated phenotypic traits contributing to an organism\u2019s fitness.\
              \ This metric, phenotypic complexity, is more objective\\nthan previous\
              \ suggestions, as complexity is measured from a fundamental biological\
              \ perspective, that of natural selection. We\\nutilize a model linking\
              \ the equilibrium fitness (drift load) of a population to phenotypic\
              \ complexity. We then use results from\\nviral evolution experiments\
              \ to compare the phenotypic complexities of two viruses, the bacteriophage\
              \ X174 and vesicular\\nstomatitis virus, and to illustrate the consistency\
              \ of our approach and its applicability. Conclusions/Significance. Because\\\
              nDarwinian evolution through natural selection is the fundamental element\
              \ unifying all biological organisms, we propose that\\nour metric of\
              \ complexity is potentially a more relevant metric than others, based\
              \ on the count of artificially defined set of\\nobjects.\\n\\nCitation:\

              \ question in biology is how organismal complexity\\nthrough the course\
              \ of evolution [1\u20135]. Although\\nchanges\\nsignificant progress\
              \ has been made in the understanding and\\nquantifying organismal characteristics\
              \ at many level of organiza-\\ntion (DNA, proteins, metabolic networks,\
              \ cellular organization,\\norgan functions,\\nindividual behavior) much\
              \ confusion remains\\nabout how to accurately quantify organismal complexity.\
              \ Several\\nintuitive proposals have been made that take into account\
              \ simple\\nmetrics such as the number of genes or cell types. However,\
              \ these\\nsimple measures quickly lead to conflicting conclusions [2,3].\
              \ Here\\nwe propose a fundamentally different approach to measuring\\\
              norganismal complexity; as opposed to relying on bottom-up\\nmeasures\
              \ such as the number of genes an organism has, we utilize\\nan objective\
              \ biological approach: natural selection. Instead of\\nasking how complex\
              \ an organism is from our own perspective, we\\nask: how complex is\
              \ an organism from the perspective of natural\\nselection? Essentially,\
              \ this is a top-down metric of organismal\\ncomplexity that we term\
              \ phenotypic complexity.\\n\\nPhenotypic complexity quantifies the number\
              \ of genetically\\nuncorrelated phenotypic traits contributing to an\
              \ organism\u2019s\\nfitness. A phenotypic trait contributes to an organism\u2019\
              s fitness\\nonly to the extent that natural selection acts upon that\
              \ trait. Thus\\nan organismal phenotype that is no longer under selection\
              \ (for\\nexample during an evolutionary transition from a generalist\
              \ to\\nspecialist lifestyle), although expressed by the organism, contri-\\\
              ntwo\\nbutes nothing to organismal complexity. Secondly,\\nphenotypes\
              \ contribute to complexity, they must be genetically\\nseparable: some\
              \ mutations must exist that affect one phenotype\\nbut not the other.\
              \ If no such mutations exist, then although we\\nmay perceive two phenotypes\
              \ under selection, these phenotypes\\ncontribute only a single trait\\\
              ntoward determining phenotypic\\ncomplexity. As an example consider\
              \ the affinity of an enzyme for\\na substrate, and the rate at which\
              \ that substrate is converted to\\nproduct. If there are no mutations\
              \ that affect one of these traits but\\nnot the other, then these two\
              \ phenotypes are considered one, until\\n\\nif\\n\\nthe organism gains\
              \ the genetic complexity to generate variation in\\none phenotype without\
              \ affecting the second,\\nfor example by\\nevolving functionally separate\
              \ domains in the enzyme. Phenotypic\\ncomplexity is thus a combined\
              \ description of how natural selection\\nperceives organismal phenotypes\
              \ and how phenotypic variation is\\ngenerated by the organism. This\
              \ concept was first articulated by\\nOrr, and followed later by others\
              \ [6\u20138]. Notably, it is similar to\\nthe amount of\\nphysical complexity,\
              \ which is a measure of\\ninformation that an organism encodes about\
              \ its environment [4,5].\\nAn important aspect of measuring complexity\
              \ in this manner is\\nthat both the organism and the environment affect\
              \ the metric. An\\norganism with many phenotypes, but living in simple\
              \ environment\\ncould thus be just as complex as a simpler organism\
              \ in the same\\nenvironment. For example,\\nif one organism is capable\
              \ of\\nmetabolizing both lactose and glucose, while second can\\nmetabolize\
              \ only glucose, the first organism will only be designated\\nas more\
              \ complex when there is a possibility that lactose will be\\npresent\
              \ in the environment.\\n\\nAcademic Editor: Angus Buckling, Oxford University,\

              n\\n\\fRecent population genetic theory [9,10] has suggested that\\\
              nphenotypic complexity is proportional to the drift load, a quantity\\\
              nthat describes how equilibrium mean population fitness declines\\nwith\
              \ population size. This can be intuitively understood in the\\nfollowing\
              \ manner. An organism\u2019s fitness is a result of how\\nsuccessfully\
              \ it interacts with the environment. As the number of\\ninteractions\
              \ (traits) increases, it becomes difficult to simultaneously\\nmaintain\
              \ each one. Very large populations maintain nearly\\noptimal mean population\
              \ fitness regardless of phenotypic com-\\nplexity. Small populations\
              \ can maintain high average fitness only\\nwhen there are a small number\
              \ of traits (low complexity) each\\ncontributing a relatively large\
              \ amount to fitness; if there are a large\\nnumber of traits (high complexity),\
              \ each contributing only a small\\namount to fitness, then small populations\
              \ will be incapable of\\nmaintaining all of them. Thus for complex organisms,\
              \ there will be\\na large difference in mean fitness between small and\
              \ large\\npopulations; for simple organisms, this difference in average\
              \ fitness\\nwill be small.\\n\\nfirst\\n\\nThe phenotypic model used\
              \ to link drift load to phenotypic\\ncomplexity was\\nformalized by\
              \ R. A. Fisher [11]. He\\nenvisioned a multidimensional phenotypic space\
              \ in which the\\norigin of each axis corresponded to the most-fit or\
              \ optimum\\nphenotypic value. As phenotypic values depart from the origin,\\\
              nfitness decreases. The manner in which fitness declines is described\\\
              nby a monotonically decreasing function, which may take a variety\\\
              nof shapes, e.g., linear, concave-up, or \u2013down. Individuals of\
              \ equal\\nfitness but different phenotypic values trace out fitness\
              \ isoclines in\\nthe space. If an organism has only two phenotypes,\
              \ the phenotypic\\nspace is two-dimensional and the fitness isoclines\
              \ are a series of\\ncircles centered on the origin of the axes (Fig.\
              \ 1). If an organism\\nhas n number of phenotypes, phenotypic space\
              \ is n-dimensional,\\nand each fitness\\nisocline is an n-dimensional\
              \ hyper-sphere.\\nBecause of the assumed geometry of the isoclines,\
              \ this model is\\nreferred to as Fisher\u2019s Geometric Model (FGM)\
              \ of phenotypic or\\nadaptive evolution.\\n\\nA population of individuals\
              \ can be represented as a collection of\\npoints in FGM and the phenotypic\
              \ values of each point allow\\nascertainment of the fitness of each\
              \ individual. Individual fitness\\nthen determines the probability of\
              \ each individual surviving and\\nreproducing the next generation. Evolution\
              \ is thus described in\\nFGM by following the collection of points over\
              \ many generations.\\nTo generate novel genetic variation, mutations\
              \ are drawn from an\\nassumed distribution that is centered on the phenotypic\
              \ position of\\neach individual (Fig. 1). By never descending into genotypic\
              \ space,\\nFGM is analogous to quantitative genetics models. Both types\
              \ of\\nmodels assume or require only that a component of phenotype is\\\
              nheritable. However, whereas quantitative genetic models represent\\\
              npopulations by their mean and variance, FGM is an individual-\\nbased\
              \ model in which each individual is evaluated according to its\\nfitness.\\\
              n\\nFGM makes a set of\\n\\ntheoretical predictions about how\\nadaptation\
              \ tends\\nthese have been\\nto occur, and many of\\ncorroborated by\
              \ experimental results. The greater frequency of\\nsmall-sized beneficial\
              \ mutations [12], the L-shaped distribution of\\nmutations fixed throughout\
              \ evolution [13], the existence of fitness\\nequilibriums [14], and\
              \ the absence of intrinsically beneficial or\\nintrinsically deleterious\
              \ mutations have all been observed during\\nlaboratory evolution, and\
              \ all conform to the conditions set forth\\nthus appears to offer a\
              \ reasonable\\nunder FGM. The model\\nframework for the study of microbial\
              \ evolution.\\n\\nThe utility of FGM lies in the fact that it does not\
              \ require any\\nparticular assumptions about the map between phenotype\
              \ and\\ngenotype, and that the specific predictions about how fitness\\\
              nchanges during evolution appear to be robust. In the present\\n\\nPopulation\

              n\\nAlthough earlier studies on FGM model have used such linear\\nfitness\
              \ functions (for the sake of mathematical simplicity), recent\\nexperimental\
              \ studies do not seem to support the use of such\\na function [17\u2013\
              19]. Linear fitness functions give rise to dramatic\\nsynergistic epistasis.\
              \ For example, a mutation that increases the\\ndistance to the optimal\
              \ phenotype by 0.1 units may decrease\\nfitness by 10% in the optimal\
              \ genotype (which by definition has\\na fitness of 1); an analogous\
              \ mutation will decrease fitness by 50%\\nin an organism with a fitness\
              \ of 0.2; this mutation will become\\nin any genotype with a fitness\
              \ less than 0.1. Recent\\nlethal\\nexperimental work suggests that epistasis\
              \ between deleterious\\nmutations is either antagonistic [17\u201319]\
              \ or null [20]. We therefore\\ndecided to use a family of exponential\\\

              \ and shape of\\nepistasis.\\n\\nExponential-type Fitness Decline\\\
              nIn an effort to explore fitness functions more compatible with\\nexperimental\
              \ data, we studied the following family of functions.\\nf(d) = exp(2(dQ)),\\\
              nin which fitness is an exponentially decaying\\nfunction of the distance\
              \ to the optimum to the power of Q. Q is\\na parameter that modifies\
              \ the concavity of the fitness decline. As\\norganisms move away from\
              \ the optimum the effect of the mutation\\ntend to have bigger effect\
              \ if Q.1 and smaller effect if Q,1. In\\nsuch a case the fitness equilibriums\

              \ roughly to five phage generations and effective\\npopulation size\

              \ a 300-fold\\ndifference. This suggests that there is very little curvature\
              \ of the\\nfitness function.\\n\\nWe used a second set of data from\
              \ the literature, in which\\npopulations were evolved for 20 transfers\
              \ at different effective\\nsizes. Novella et al. [22] evolved four clones\

              \ of sizes two, five, and\\nfitness\\n30. They also observed a population\
              \ size-dependant\\nconvergence. Although the time for convergence was\
              \ relatively\\nshort (40 viral generations), several populations experienced\
              \ no\\nsignificant increases or decreases in fitness over all replicates\
              \ at\\na given population size, suggesting that those population were\
              \ at or\\nnear an equilibrium fitness value. We used the fitness estimates\\\
              nfrom 24 populations evolved at population sizes of two, five and\\\
              n30. Every transfer corresponded to roughly two viral generations\\\
              nand effective population size was thus approximated as two times\\\
              nthe number of viral plaques transferred.\\n\\nAdditionally, an impressive\
              \ set of data using site directed\\nmutagenesis in VSV suggests that\
              \ the concavity of fitness function\\nis slightly upward [19]. However,\
              \ in further analyses we estimate\\nQ as 1 for both the phage and the\

              \ case.\\n\\nEstimates of Phenotypic Complexity for VSV and\\nwX174\\\
              nWe applied the maximum likelihood estimator to the experimental\\nestimates\
              \ of population fitness for wX174 and VSV, and using\\na likelihood\
              \ ratio test we defined 95% confidence intervals (CI),\\nwhich we list\
              \ here in parentheses. For wX174 we found ne/Q = 45\\n(42249), and fref\
              \ = 1.245 (1.2321.26), whereas for VSV we found\\nne/Q = 10 (8212) and\
              \ fref = 1.98 (1.9422.05) (Fig. 3). In both of\\nthese cases, fref is\
              \ calculated per generation relative to the ancestral\\nvirus for wX174\
              \ and relative to a reference strain for VSV. As no\\nstrong signature\
              \ of curvature in the fitness surface has been found\\nfor either virus,\
              \ we assume that Q is approximately one.\\n\\nDISCUSSION\\nTo understand\
              \ how biological complexity changes during the\\ncourse of evolution,\
              \ a metric is needed. Previously, measures such\\nas the number of genes,\
              \ cell types or metabolic processes have\\nthey often lead to incongruent\
              \ results.\\nbeen proposed, but\\nOrganisms with more cell types do\
              \ not necessarily have more\\ngenes. Here we suggest that a metric unifying\
              \ biological systems\\nhas not been appropriately identified. To circumvent\
              \ this problem,\\nwe have developed a metric of biological complexity\
              \ termed\\nphenotypic complexity (ne). We have quantified this metric\
              \ in the\\nviruses wX174 and VSV by utilizing a population genetic model\\\
              nthat describes how phenotypic complexity affects the drift load that\\\

              \ measure of the number of\\nthat are acted upon by\\ngenetically uncorrelated\

              \ natural\\nselection is\\nthe fundamental element unifying all biological\\\
              norganisms, we propose that ne is potentially a more relevant\\nmetric\

              \ quantified the\\ndependency of the drift load (equilibrium fitness)\

              \ linear fitness\\nfunction that has been employed previously to simplify\
              \ the\\nmathematical analyses is no longer necessary. Such a function\\\
              nmakes strong assumptions about the form of the fitness landscape;\\\
              nspecifically, mutational effects become very large as fitness is\\\
              nreduced. Thus at low fitness most mutations are either lethal or of\\\
              nvery large effect, a scenario which is incompatible with what we\\\
              nhave previously observed [14].\\n\\nWe have therefore studied a more\
              \ general family of fitness\\nfunctions of the form f(d) = exp(2(dQ)),\
              \ and found that Feq(Ne,\\nne) = (12(2?Ne21)21)(ne/Q). It appears that\
              \ this equation remains\\nvalid over a much wider range of conditions\
              \ than those used in the\\ncanonical FGM, in which mutations are required\
              \ to be isotropic\\nand fitness isoclines are symmetric about the origin.\
              \ An interesting\\nfeature of this formula is that it does not require\
              \ a model in which\\nmutations can affect all phenotypic traits simultaneously.\
              \ In the\\ninitial formulation of FGM, all phenotypic axes intersect\
              \ at the\\norigin of each axis. This original FGM can be modified slightly\\\
              nsuch that some phenotypes are grouped into separate phenotypic\\nmodules,\
              \ and within a module, all phenotypes again intersect at\\neach other\u2019\
              s origin. Any mutation that occurs within a module can\\naffect only\
              \ other phenotypes within that module, and none that lie\\noutside of\
              \ it (i.e. there is no pleiotropy between modules, an idea\\nsimilar\
              \ to previous conceptions of modularity [23]). Using the\\nmore general\
              \ description of the equilibrium drift load that we have\\nderived above,\
              \ a phenotypic landscape a composed of a single\\nmodule with ne dimensions\
              \ has the same drift load function as\\na landscape composed of m independent\
              \ modules of size ne,i with\\nSi ne,i = ne because we have\\n\\n(cid:1)\\\

              n\\nOther Attempts to Estimate Phenotypic Complexity\\nRecently, another\
              \ theoretical study developed a framework to\\nestimate phenotypic complexity\
              \ [21]. The model developed used\\npredictions on the distribution of\
              \ mutational effects to estimate\\ncomplexity. This analysis, which\
              \ is completely independent from\\nours, found an interesting correlation\
              \ between gene number and\\ncomplexity in a variety of organisms ranging\
              \ from a virus to C.\\nelegans. However, for all the organisms for which\
              \ enough data\\nthe number of phenotypic\\nexisted to perform the analysis,\\\
              ndimensions estimated was very small; 0.21 phenotypic dimensions\\nfor\
              \ E. coli, 1.07 in VSV, 1\u20132 for S. cerevisiae, and 2\u20133 for\
              \ D.\\nmelanogaster and C. elegans. We think that several effects may\
              \ limit\\nthe predictive quality such a method. Firstly, mutation accumu-\\\
              nlation methods and the inherent noise in fitness estimates are very\\\
              ndifferent across species and comparison across species are thus\\ndifficult.\
              \ One illustration of this is the large variability in fitness\\nestimates\
              \ for mutations in a single species using two methods: in\\nVSV earlier\
              \ estimates (using Bateman-Mukai estimates) predicted\\na 0.002 mean\
              \ fitness effect per mutation, while more recent and\\naccurate estimates\
              \ (which introduced each mutation individually)\\nbrought the estimate\
              \ it to 14% (a 70-fold difference). Secondly,\\nneutral mutations are\
              \ not considered in the model developed by\\nMartin and Lenormand. However,\

              ncalculation of mean fitness effects of mutations even if they do\\\
              nnot affect any phenotype in the laboratory environment. Third,\\ncontrary\
              \ to our model, if phenotypes are organized in different\\nmodules (as\
              \ many data suggest), their model will provide different\\nestimates;\
              \ in other words, their model requires that all traits can be\\nsimultaneously\
              \ affected by a single mutations. All these considera-\\ntions suggest\
              \ that a second independent model should be used to\\nestimate phenotypic\
              \ complexity.\\n\\nOne of the central FGM hypotheses that we have so\
              \ far not\\naddressed is the single-peaked nature of the landscape.\
              \ Although\\nFGM contains few assumptions about the nature of the genotypic\\\
              nlandscape, the model explicitly requires a phenotypic landscape\\ncontaining\
              \ a single peak; without this, then the fitness function,\\nf(d), cannot\
              \ be described by a decreasing function. However,\\nrecent experimental\
              \ evidence over large evolutionary time scales\\nstrongly suggests that\
              \ while the genotypic landscape may contain\\nmultiple peaks, the phenotypic\
              \ landscape is generally much less\\ncomplex. Several experimental studies\
              \ using microbes have shown\\nthat a considerable amount of phenotypic\
              \ convergence occurs\\nduring evolution [24\u201327], even when organisms\
              \ begin from\\ndifferent starting points in the landscape [28]. These\
              \ phenomena\\nwould only be expected if the phenotypic landscape exhibited\\\
              na single-peak. However, the evidence for ruggedness in the genetic\\\
              nlandscape is also substantial, especially in experiments that have\\\
              nlooked at bacterial evolution of resistance to antibiotics [29]. In\\\
              nthis case, the fitness relationships between the wild type genotypes,\\\
              nresistant genotypes, compensated resistant genotypes, and sensitive\\\
              ngenotypes bearing the compensatory mutation exhibit high levels\\nof\
              \ epistasis, characteristic of a rugged genetic landscape. In other\\\
              nin which the cost of resistance was associated with\\nstudies\\na phenotype\
              \ [30],\\nfitness restoration to wild-type level was\\nsometimes observed\
              \ and, more importantly for our concern, it\\nthe phenotypic damage\\\
              nwas associated with a restoration of\\nthe resistance mutation\\nassociated\
              \ with the occurrence of\\n(transcription efficiency of\\nrifampicin\
              \ resistant mutants was\\nrestored back to the level observed in rifampicin\
              \ sensitive strain).\\nThis also suggests the singularity of the phenotypic\
              \ optimum,\\nalthough different genetic combinations may underlie this\\\
              nis focusing neither on the\\noptimum. However, as our model\\ngenetic\

              \ (ruggedness means that several mutations could be\\nneeded to restore\
              \ the effect of one) it should not be too sensitive to\\nthe small level\
              \ ruggedness of the genetic landscape described so\\nfar.\\n\\nThe Concept\
              \ of Phenotypic Complexity\\nAs discussed previously, the quantity denoted\
              \ by ne is the number\\nof genetically uncorrelated phenotypes that\
              \ are influenced by the\\naction of natural selection. The dimensions\
              \ enumerated by ne are\\nthus genetically orthogonal to each other,\
              \ and analogous to the\\naxes needed to describe the variation among\
              \ multiple phenotypes\\nmeasured on a collection of individuals and\
              \ mutants in a principal\\ncomponent analysis. However, the number of\
              \ axes enumerated by\\nne is filtered by natural selection, while in\
              \ a PCA analysis the\\nnumber of axes is limited only by the number\
              \ of independent\\nphenotypes\\nthat are measured. Because each phenotype\
              \ is\\noptimized at a value determined by each organism\u2019s ecological\\\
              nenvironment, there is a dependence of phenotypic complexity on\\nthe\
              \ complexity of\\nthe ecological niche experienced by each\\norganism;\
              \ if natural selection does not act on a phenotype, then\\nthat phenotype\
              \ does not contribute to the complexity metric.\\nFinally, although\
              \ the estimates of ne arise from an idealized model\\n\\nPLoS ONE |\

              nof magnitude smaller than either the number of nucleotides or\\neven\
              \ the number of amino acids encoded by the genomes of these\\norganisms\
              \ (5386 bp and 11,161bp in wX174 and VSV, respec-\\ntively). This agrees\
              \ with the concept of phenotypic complexity that\\nwe have defined.\
              \ Although mutations that occur at one nucleotide\\nor amino acid do\
              \ not affect\\nthey are\\ngenetically separable phenotypes), it is clearly\
              \ unlikely that each\\nnucleotide or amino acid is independently acted\
              \ up by natural\\nselection. Secondly, each estimate of complexity is\
              \ greater than the\\nnumber of genes encoded by each virus (11 and 5\
              \ for wX174 and\\nVSV, respectively). The presence of multiple functional\
              \ domains\\nwithin a single protein is consistent with an estimate of\
              \ complexity\\nthat is greater than the number of encoded proteins.\\\
              n\\nthose at another (i.e.\\n\\nAlthough we have only two estimates,\
              \ we can briefly consider\\nthem from a comparative standpoint: although\
              \ the genome size of\\nwX174 is half of VSV, our estimate of phenotypic\
              \ complexity\\nquantifies wX174 as being approximately four-fold more\
              \ complex.\\nIt is notable, then, that wX174 contains approximately\
              \ twice the\\nnumber of genes as VSV. Additionally, the lifestyle of\
              \ wX174 is\\narguably much more elaborate than that of VSV. wX174 interacts\\\
              nwith several host factors in order to perform transcription and\\nreplication;\
              \ 13 host factors are required for replication alone [31].\\nThis can\
              \ be contrasted with VSV, in which transcription and\\nreplication are\
              \ similar processes, both performed by the viral\\npolymerase. Few host\\\
              nfactors (and thus few interactions) are\\nnecessary at all during the\
              \ entire life cycle of VSV [32].\\n\\nThese estimates suggest that,\
              \ for very simple organisms such as\\nviruses, phenotypic complexity\
              \ correlates well with the number of\\ngenes in an organism, and more\
              \ specifically, with the number of\\ninteractions characteristic of\
              \ that organism [2]. This observation\\nsupports the idea that phenotypic\
              \ complexity depends on the\\ninteractions between an organism and its\
              \ environment. Genome\\nsize in itself seems to be a poor correlate\
              \ of phenotypic complexity,\\na notable result in consideration of the\
              \ very small genome sizes of\\nthese organisms. Whether\\nsuch correlations\
              \ or absence of\\ncorrelation with gene number or genome length would\
              \ hold for\\nmore complex organisms remains an open question. Nevertheless,\\\
              nby studying very simple organisms, we have shown that the use of\\\
              ndrift load could be used to estimate complexity in a novel and\\nconsistent\
              \ way. We now propose that such a method could be\\nhelpful to identify\
              \ and quantify the strongest determinants of\\nbiological complexity\
              \ of higher organisms.\\n\\nAlthough the theory presented here appears\
              \ to be quite robust,\\nit is too early to conclude that it is an accurate\
              \ reflection of the\\nunderlying biology. To be studied in an FGM framework,\\\
              n\\nPopulation Genetic Complexity\\n\\nfor population size-dependent\\\
              n\\norganisms need to present at least one phenotypic property to\\\
              nselection. Additionally, populations, even those of very small size,\\\
              nis explicitly\\nshould evolve towards a fitness equilibrium that\\\
              ndependent on population size. We found data in the literature\\nconsistent\
              \ with this expectation for one organism, VSV. We now\\nprovide further\
              \ support\\nfitness\\nequilibria by evolving populations of the bacteriophage\
              \ wX174.\\nTogether, these two data sets suggest that evolutionary analyses\\\
              nusing an FGM framework are a valid approach. Moreover, the use\\nof\
              \ very simple organisms such as viruses is useful for gaining insight\\\
              ninto metrics of complexity, as for such simple organisms, gene\\nnumber\
              \ is likely to be a very good correlate of organismal\\ncomplexity,\
              \ and this should be reflected by the metric. Although\\nour observations\
              \ are currently limited to two viral species, it is\\n(i.e. population\
              \ size-\\nclear that\\nfrom both a qualitative level\\n(that the\\ndependent\

              \ of phenotypic dimensions are reasonable)\\npredictions from FGM theory\
              \ are borne out. An assessment of\\ndrift load and phenotypic complexity\
              \ in a greater number of\\norganisms is needed before further conclusions\
              \ can be drawn.\\n\\nConclusions\\nHere we have presented a top-down\
              \ approach to quantifying\\nbiological complexity. This can be contrasted\
              \ with previously\\nproposed metrics of complexity, which have relied\
              \ on physically\\nmeasurable quantities of the organism (bottom-up approaches).\\\
              nTwo important conceptual differences separate these two ap-\\nproaches.\
              \ Most importantly, phenotypic complexity is dependent\\non both the\
              \ organism and the environmental context. An\\norganism is not complex\
              \ because it has many measurable\\nphenotypes; it is complex because\
              \ it has many phenotypes on\\nwhich natural selection acts. Secondly,\
              \ phenotypic complexity\\ndoes not rely on artificially constructed\
              \ concepts such as genes\\n[33]. As an example, if two genes are deemed\
              \ to be of equal\\nsuch a\\ncomplexity because they are functionally\
              \ equivalent,\\nmeasure necessarily ignores the subtle ways in which\
              \ each may\\nbe regulated, or spliced, or expressed within the cell.\
              \ Quantify-\\ning such multiple layers of complexity is difficult if\
              \ the metric\\nrelies on physically measurable quantities.\\n\\nHowever,\
              \ phenotypic complexity remains an inherently abstract\\nmetric. It\
              \ cannot aid in identifying the specific characteristics\\ncontributing\
              \ to the complexity of an organism. Instead, it addresses\\nthe complexity\
              \ with which natural selection views an organism, and\\nthe complexity\
              \ with which an organism is capable of generating\\nnovel phenotypic\
              \ variation. For this reason, testing how phenotypic\\ncomplexity compares\
              \ to more traditional metrics of complexity (for\\nexample, the numbers\
              \ of genes, protein interactions, or cellular\\npathways) may provide\
              \ significant insight into biological systems.\\nFinally, phenotypic\
              \ complexity (and the resulting equilibrium drift\\nload) affords a\
              \ unique opportunity to contrast the action of natural\\nselection between\
              \ different organisms or different environments in\\na very general\
              \ and unconstrained manner.\\n\\nMETHODS\\nViral Evolution\\nThe details\
              \ of experimental evolution of wX174 have been\\ndescribed previously\
              \ [14]. Briefly, phage were mutagenized in\\n250 mM hydroxylamine, 1mM\
              \ EDTA at 37uC for 140 minutes.\\nMutagenic treatment was stopped by\
              \ 100 to 1000-fold dilution\\ninto fresh media, after which they were\
              \ plated on LC agar plates\\ncontaining a bacterial lawn and grown overnight\
              \ at 32uC. From\\nthese plates, a number of plaques equal to the bottleneck\

        \ Various definitions of biological complexity have been proposed: the number\
        \ of genes, cell types, or metabolic\\nprocesses within an organism. As knowledge\
        \ of biological systems has increased, it has become apparent that these metrics\\\
        nare often incongruent. Methodology. Here we propose an alternative complexity\
        \ metric based on the number of genetically\\nuncorrelated phenotypic traits\
        \ contributing to an organism\u2019s fitness. This metric, phenotypic complexity,\
        \ is more objective\\nthan previous suggestions, as complexity is measured\
        \ from a fundamental biological perspective, that of natural selection. We\\\
        nutilize a model linking the equilibrium fitness (drift load) of a population\
        \ to phenotypic complexity. We then use results from\\nviral evolution experiments\
        \ to compare the phenotypic complexities of two viruses, the bacteriophage\
        \ X174 and vesicular\\nstomatitis virus, and to illustrate the consistency\
        \ of our approach and its applicability. Conclusions/Significance. Because\\\
        nDarwinian evolution through natural selection is the fundamental element\
        \ unifying all biological organisms, we propose that\\nour metric of complexity\
        \ is potentially a more relevant metric than others, based on the count of\

        n\\nINTRODUCTION\\nA persistent question in biology is how organismal complexity\\\
        nthrough the course of evolution [1\u20135]. Although\\nchanges\\nsignificant\
        \ progress has been made in the understanding and\\nquantifying organismal\
        \ characteristics at many level of organiza-\\ntion (DNA, proteins, metabolic\
        \ networks, cellular organization,\\norgan functions,\\nindividual behavior)\
        \ much confusion remains\\nabout how to accurately quantify organismal complexity.\
        \ Several\\nintuitive proposals have been made that take into account simple\\\
        nmetrics such as the number of genes or cell types. However, these\\nsimple\
        \ measures quickly lead to conflicting conclusions [2,3]. Here\\nwe propose\
        \ a fundamentally different approach to measuring\\norganismal complexity;\
        \ as opposed to relying on bottom-up\\nmeasures such as the number of genes\
        \ an organism has, we utilize\\nan objective biological approach: natural\
        \ selection. Instead of\\nasking how complex an organism is from our own perspective,\
        \ we\\nask: how complex is an organism from the perspective of natural\\nselection?\
        \ Essentially, this is a top-down metric of organismal\\ncomplexity that we\
        \ term phenotypic complexity.\\n\\nPhenotypic complexity quantifies the number\
        \ of genetically\\nuncorrelated phenotypic traits contributing to an organism\u2019\
        s\\nfitness. A phenotypic trait contributes to an organism\u2019s fitness\\\
        nonly to the extent that natural selection acts upon that trait. Thus\\nan\
        \ organismal phenotype that is no longer under selection (for\\nexample during\
        \ an evolutionary transition from a generalist to\\nspecialist lifestyle),\
        \ although expressed by the organism, contri-\\ntwo\\nbutes nothing to organismal\
        \ complexity. Secondly,\\nphenotypes contribute to complexity, they must be\
        \ genetically\\nseparable: some mutations must exist that affect one phenotype\\\
        nbut not the other. If no such mutations exist, then although we\\nmay perceive\
        \ two phenotypes under selection, these phenotypes\\ncontribute only a single\
        \ trait\\ntoward determining phenotypic\\ncomplexity. As an example consider\
        \ the affinity of an enzyme for\\na substrate, and the rate at which that\
        \ substrate is converted to\\nproduct. If there are no mutations that affect\
        \ one of these traits but\\nnot the other, then these two phenotypes are considered\
        \ one, until\\n\\nif\\n\\nthe organism gains the genetic complexity to generate\
        \ variation in\\none phenotype without affecting the second,\\nfor example\
        \ by\\nevolving functionally separate domains in the enzyme. Phenotypic\\\
        ncomplexity is thus a combined description of how natural selection\\nperceives\
        \ organismal phenotypes and how phenotypic variation is\\ngenerated by the\
        \ organism. This concept was first articulated by\\nOrr, and followed later\
        \ by others [6\u20138]. Notably, it is similar to\\nthe amount of\\nphysical\
        \ complexity, which is a measure of\\ninformation that an organism encodes\
        \ about its environment [4,5].\\nAn important aspect of measuring complexity\
        \ in this manner is\\nthat both the organism and the environment affect the\
        \ metric. An\\norganism with many phenotypes, but living in simple environment\\\
        ncould thus be just as complex as a simpler organism in the same\\nenvironment.\
        \ For example,\\nif one organism is capable of\\nmetabolizing both lactose\
        \ and glucose, while second can\\nmetabolize only glucose, the first organism\
        \ will only be designated\\nas more complex when there is a possibility that\
        \ lactose will be\\npresent in the environment.\\n\\nAcademic Editor: Angus\

        \ e217\\n\\n\\fRecent population genetic theory [9,10] has suggested that\\\
        nphenotypic complexity is proportional to the drift load, a quantity\\nthat\
        \ describes how equilibrium mean population fitness declines\\nwith population\
        \ size. This can be intuitively understood in the\\nfollowing manner. An organism\u2019\
        s fitness is a result of how\\nsuccessfully it interacts with the environment.\
        \ As the number of\\ninteractions (traits) increases, it becomes difficult\
        \ to simultaneously\\nmaintain each one. Very large populations maintain nearly\\\
        noptimal mean population fitness regardless of phenotypic com-\\nplexity.\
        \ Small populations can maintain high average fitness only\\nwhen there are\
        \ a small number of traits (low complexity) each\\ncontributing a relatively\
        \ large amount to fitness; if there are a large\\nnumber of traits (high complexity),\
        \ each contributing only a small\\namount to fitness, then small populations\
        \ will be incapable of\\nmaintaining all of them. Thus for complex organisms,\
        \ there will be\\na large difference in mean fitness between small and large\\\
        npopulations; for simple organisms, this difference in average fitness\\nwill\
        \ be small.\\n\\nfirst\\n\\nThe phenotypic model used to link drift load to\
        \ phenotypic\\ncomplexity was\\nformalized by R. A. Fisher [11]. He\\nenvisioned\
        \ a multidimensional phenotypic space in which the\\norigin of each axis corresponded\
        \ to the most-fit or optimum\\nphenotypic value. As phenotypic values depart\
        \ from the origin,\\nfitness decreases. The manner in which fitness declines\
        \ is described\\nby a monotonically decreasing function, which may take a\
        \ variety\\nof shapes, e.g., linear, concave-up, or \u2013down. Individuals\
        \ of equal\\nfitness but different phenotypic values trace out fitness isoclines\
        \ in\\nthe space. If an organism has only two phenotypes, the phenotypic\\\
        nspace is two-dimensional and the fitness isoclines are a series of\\ncircles\
        \ centered on the origin of the axes (Fig. 1). If an organism\\nhas n number\
        \ of phenotypes, phenotypic space is n-dimensional,\\nand each fitness\\nisocline\
        \ is an n-dimensional hyper-sphere.\\nBecause of the assumed geometry of the\
        \ isoclines, this model is\\nreferred to as Fisher\u2019s Geometric Model\
        \ (FGM) of phenotypic or\\nadaptive evolution.\\n\\nA population of individuals\
        \ can be represented as a collection of\\npoints in FGM and the phenotypic\
        \ values of each point allow\\nascertainment of the fitness of each individual.\
        \ Individual fitness\\nthen determines the probability of each individual\
        \ surviving and\\nreproducing the next generation. Evolution is thus described\
        \ in\\nFGM by following the collection of points over many generations.\\\
        nTo generate novel genetic variation, mutations are drawn from an\\nassumed\
        \ distribution that is centered on the phenotypic position of\\neach individual\
        \ (Fig. 1). By never descending into genotypic space,\\nFGM is analogous to\
        \ quantitative genetics models. Both types of\\nmodels assume or require only\
        \ that a component of phenotype is\\nheritable. However, whereas quantitative\
        \ genetic models represent\\npopulations by their mean and variance, FGM is\
        \ an individual-\\nbased model in which each individual is evaluated according\
        \ to its\\nfitness.\\n\\nFGM makes a set of\\n\\ntheoretical predictions about\
        \ how\\nadaptation tends\\nthese have been\\nto occur, and many of\\ncorroborated\
        \ by experimental results. The greater frequency of\\nsmall-sized beneficial\
        \ mutations [12], the L-shaped distribution of\\nmutations fixed throughout\
        \ evolution [13], the existence of fitness\\nequilibriums [14], and the absence\
        \ of intrinsically beneficial or\\nintrinsically deleterious mutations have\
        \ all been observed during\\nlaboratory evolution, and all conform to the\
        \ conditions set forth\\nthus appears to offer a reasonable\\nunder FGM. The\
        \ model\\nframework for the study of microbial evolution.\\n\\nThe utility\
        \ of FGM lies in the fact that it does not require any\\nparticular assumptions\
        \ about the map between phenotype and\\ngenotype, and that the specific predictions\
        \ about how fitness\\nchanges during evolution appear to be robust. In the\
        \ present\\n\\nPopulation Genetic Complexity\\n\\nFigure 1. Fisher\u2019s\
        \ geometric model in two-dimensional phenotypic\\nspace. Fitness varies along\
        \ two phenotypic axes, with the maximum\\nfitness located, for convenience,\
        \ at the origin of these axes. Any\\nindividual in a population (black point)\
        \ can thus be described by its\\nphenotypic values, which determine the fitness\
        \ of that organism. At any\\nspecific fitness, there are a number of other\
        \ phenotypic combinations\\nthat have equivalent fitness; the values of these\
        \ phenotypic combina-\\ntions establish the fitness isoclines (black circle).\
        \ From the optimum,\\nthe\\nfitness declines monotonically according to the\
        \ structure of\\nlandscape (see text). Each mutation (arrow) is drawn from\
        \ a distribution\\ncentered on the phenotypic position of each individual,\
        \ resulting in\\noffspring with new phenotypic combinations and fitness values\
        \ (white\\npoint).\\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0000217.g001\\n\\npaper, we\

        \ Taubes [9] (although\\nWagner and Gabriel [15] had worked previously on\
        \ a similar\\nquestion), and was later refined by Poon and Otto [10]. Recent\\\
        ntheoretical techniques from statistical physics now allow an exact\\nsolution\

        \ Linear fitness functions give rise to dramatic\\nsynergistic epistasis.\
        \ For example, a mutation that increases the\\ndistance to the optimal phenotype\
        \ by 0.1 units may decrease\\nfitness by 10% in the optimal genotype (which\
        \ by definition has\\na fitness of 1); an analogous mutation will decrease\
        \ fitness by 50%\\nin an organism with a fitness of 0.2; this mutation will\
        \ become\\nin any genotype with a fitness less than 0.1. Recent\\nlethal\\\
        nexperimental work suggests that epistasis between deleterious\\nmutations\
        \ is either antagonistic [17\u201319] or null [20]. We therefore\\ndecided\

        \ in a manner compatible with the assumptions\\nof FGM. From these populations\
        \ we obtained 21 measures of\\nequilibrium fitness at five different population\
        \ sizes. Every transfer\\ncorresponded roughly to five phage generations and\
        \ effective\\npopulation size was then approximated to five times the number\

        \ of the fitness function we performed\\na mutation accumulation analysis\

        \ mutations was\\nsimilar at both ends of the fitness range spanning a 300-fold\\\
        ndifference. This suggests that there is very little curvature of the\\nfitness\
        \ function.\\n\\nWe used a second set of data from the literature, in which\\\
        npopulations were evolved for 20 transfers at different effective\\nsizes.\
        \ Novella et al. [22] evolved four clones of vesicular stomatitis\\nvirus\
        \ (VSV) using plaque-to-plaque transfers of sizes two, five, and\\nfitness\\\
        n30. They also observed a population size-dependant\\nconvergence. Although\
        \ the time for convergence was relatively\\nshort (40 viral generations),\
        \ several populations experienced no\\nsignificant increases or decreases\
        \ in fitness over all replicates at\\na given population size, suggesting\
        \ that those population were at or\\nnear an equilibrium fitness value. We\
        \ used the fitness estimates\\nfrom 24 populations evolved at population sizes\
        \ of two, five and\\n30. Every transfer corresponded to roughly two viral\
        \ generations\\nand effective population size was thus approximated as two\
        \ times\\nthe number of viral plaques transferred.\\n\\nAdditionally, an impressive\
        \ set of data using site directed\\nmutagenesis in VSV suggests that the concavity\
        \ of fitness function\\nis slightly upward [19]. However, in further analyses\
        \ we estimate\\nQ as 1 for both the phage and the virus, as no clear departure\
        \ from\\n1 has been observed in either case.\\n\\nEstimates of Phenotypic\
        \ Complexity for VSV and\\nwX174\\nWe applied the maximum likelihood estimator\
        \ to the experimental\\nestimates of population fitness for wX174 and VSV,\
        \ and using\\na likelihood ratio test we defined 95% confidence intervals\
        \ (CI),\\nwhich we list here in parentheses. For wX174 we found ne/Q = 45\\\
        n(42249), and fref = 1.245 (1.2321.26), whereas for VSV we found\\nne/Q =\
        \ 10 (8212) and fref = 1.98 (1.9422.05) (Fig. 3). In both of\\nthese cases,\
        \ fref is calculated per generation relative to the ancestral\\nvirus for\
        \ wX174 and relative to a reference strain for VSV. As no\\nstrong signature\
        \ of curvature in the fitness surface has been found\\nfor either virus, we\
        \ assume that Q is approximately one.\\n\\nDISCUSSION\\nTo understand how\
        \ biological complexity changes during the\\ncourse of evolution, a metric\
        \ is needed. Previously, measures such\\nas the number of genes, cell types\
        \ or metabolic processes have\\nthey often lead to incongruent results.\\\
        nbeen proposed, but\\nOrganisms with more cell types do not necessarily have\
        \ more\\ngenes. Here we suggest that a metric unifying biological systems\\\
        nhas not been appropriately identified. To circumvent this problem,\\nwe have\
        \ developed a metric of biological complexity termed\\nphenotypic complexity\
        \ (ne). We have quantified this metric in the\\nviruses wX174 and VSV by utilizing\
        \ a population genetic model\\nthat describes how phenotypic complexity affects\
        \ the drift load that\\na population experiences.\\n\\nPhenotypic complexity\
        \ (ne)\\n\\nis a measure of the number of\\nthat are acted upon by\\ngenetically\
        \ uncorrelated phenotypes\\nnatural selection. Because Darwinian evolution\
        \ through natural\\nselection is\\nthe fundamental element unifying all biological\\\
        norganisms, we propose that ne is potentially a more relevant\\nmetric than\
        \ those previously suggested.\\n\\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org\\n\\n4\\n\\\
        nFebruary 2007 |\\n\\nIssue 2 | e217\\n\\n\\fRobustness of the Model\\nUsing\
        \ recent theoretical results we have analytically quantified the\\ndependency\
        \ of the drift load (equilibrium fitness) on the effective\\npopulation size\
        \ and phenotypic complexity. The linear fitness\\nfunction that has been employed\
        \ previously to simplify the\\nmathematical analyses is no longer necessary.\
        \ Such a function\\nmakes strong assumptions about the form of the fitness\
        \ landscape;\\nspecifically, mutational effects become very large as fitness\
        \ is\\nreduced. Thus at low fitness most mutations are either lethal or of\\\
        nvery large effect, a scenario which is incompatible with what we\\nhave previously\
        \ observed [14].\\n\\nWe have therefore studied a more general family of fitness\\\
        nfunctions of the form f(d) = exp(2(dQ)), and found that Feq(Ne,\\nne) = (12(2?Ne21)21)(ne/Q).\
        \ It appears that this equation remains\\nvalid over a much wider range of\
        \ conditions than those used in the\\ncanonical FGM, in which mutations are\
        \ required to be isotropic\\nand fitness isoclines are symmetric about the\
        \ origin. An interesting\\nfeature of this formula is that it does not require\
        \ a model in which\\nmutations can affect all phenotypic traits simultaneously.\
        \ In the\\ninitial formulation of FGM, all phenotypic axes intersect at the\\\
        norigin of each axis. This original FGM can be modified slightly\\nsuch that\
        \ some phenotypes are grouped into separate phenotypic\\nmodules, and within\
        \ a module, all phenotypes again intersect at\\neach other\u2019s origin.\
        \ Any mutation that occurs within a module can\\naffect only other phenotypes\
        \ within that module, and none that lie\\noutside of it (i.e. there is no\
        \ pleiotropy between modules, an idea\\nsimilar to previous conceptions of\
        \ modularity [23]). Using the\\nmore general description of the equilibrium\
        \ drift load that we have\\nderived above, a phenotypic landscape a composed\
        \ of a single\\nmodule with ne dimensions has the same drift load function\
        \ as\\na landscape composed of m independent modules of size ne,i with\\nSi\
        \ ne,i = ne because we have\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n1{ 2Ne{1\\n\xDE\\n\\n\xF0\\n\\\

        \ underlying FGM.\\n\\nOther Attempts to Estimate Phenotypic Complexity\\\
        nRecently, another theoretical study developed a framework to\\nestimate phenotypic\
        \ complexity [21]. The model developed used\\npredictions on the distribution\
        \ of mutational effects to estimate\\ncomplexity. This analysis, which is\
        \ completely independent from\\nours, found an interesting correlation between\
        \ gene number and\\ncomplexity in a variety of organisms ranging from a virus\
        \ to C.\\nelegans. However, for all the organisms for which enough data\\\
        nthe number of phenotypic\\nexisted to perform the analysis,\\ndimensions\
        \ estimated was very small; 0.21 phenotypic dimensions\\nfor E. coli, 1.07\
        \ in VSV, 1\u20132 for S. cerevisiae, and 2\u20133 for D.\\nmelanogaster and\
        \ C. elegans. We think that several effects may limit\\nthe predictive quality\
        \ such a method. Firstly, mutation accumu-\\nlation methods and the inherent\
        \ noise in fitness estimates are very\\ndifferent across species and comparison\
        \ across species are thus\\ndifficult. One illustration of this is the large\
        \ variability in fitness\\nestimates for mutations in a single species using\
        \ two methods: in\\nVSV earlier estimates (using Bateman-Mukai estimates)\
        \ predicted\\na 0.002 mean fitness effect per mutation, while more recent\
        \ and\\naccurate estimates (which introduced each mutation individually)\\\
        nbrought the estimate it to 14% (a 70-fold difference). Secondly,\\nneutral\
        \ mutations are not considered in the model developed by\\nMartin and Lenormand.\
        \ However, part of the mutation produced\\n\\nPopulation Genetic Complexity\\\

        \ genes useless in laboratory\\nconditions and will\\nin the\\ncalculation\
        \ of mean fitness effects of mutations even if they do\\nnot affect any phenotype\
        \ in the laboratory environment. Third,\\ncontrary to our model, if phenotypes\
        \ are organized in different\\nmodules (as many data suggest), their model\
        \ will provide different\\nestimates; in other words, their model requires\
        \ that all traits can be\\nsimultaneously affected by a single mutations.\
        \ All these considera-\\ntions suggest that a second independent model should\
        \ be used to\\nestimate phenotypic complexity.\\n\\nOne of the central FGM\
        \ hypotheses that we have so far not\\naddressed is the single-peaked nature\
        \ of the landscape. Although\\nFGM contains few assumptions about the nature\
        \ of the genotypic\\nlandscape, the model explicitly requires a phenotypic\
        \ landscape\\ncontaining a single peak; without this, then the fitness function,\\\
        nf(d), cannot be described by a decreasing function. However,\\nrecent experimental\
        \ evidence over large evolutionary time scales\\nstrongly suggests that while\
        \ the genotypic landscape may contain\\nmultiple peaks, the phenotypic landscape\
        \ is generally much less\\ncomplex. Several experimental studies using microbes\
        \ have shown\\nthat a considerable amount of phenotypic convergence occurs\\\
        nduring evolution [24\u201327], even when organisms begin from\\ndifferent\
        \ starting points in the landscape [28]. These phenomena\\nwould only be expected\
        \ if the phenotypic landscape exhibited\\na single-peak. However, the evidence\
        \ for ruggedness in the genetic\\nlandscape is also substantial, especially\
        \ in experiments that have\\nlooked at bacterial evolution of resistance to\
        \ antibiotics [29]. In\\nthis case, the fitness relationships between the\
        \ wild type genotypes,\\nresistant genotypes, compensated resistant genotypes,\
        \ and sensitive\\ngenotypes bearing the compensatory mutation exhibit high\
        \ levels\\nof epistasis, characteristic of a rugged genetic landscape. In\
        \ other\\nin which the cost of resistance was associated with\\nstudies\\\
        na phenotype [30],\\nfitness restoration to wild-type level was\\nsometimes\
        \ observed and, more importantly for our concern, it\\nthe phenotypic damage\\\
        nwas associated with a restoration of\\nthe resistance mutation\\nassociated\
        \ with the occurrence of\\n(transcription efficiency of\\nrifampicin resistant\
        \ mutants was\\nrestored back to the level observed in rifampicin sensitive\
        \ strain).\\nThis also suggests the singularity of the phenotypic optimum,\\\
        nalthough different genetic combinations may underlie this\\nis focusing neither\
        \ on the\\noptimum. However, as our model\\ngenetic nature of the adaptive\
        \ landscape, nor on the rate of\\nadaptation (ruggedness means that several\
        \ mutations could be\\nneeded to restore the effect of one) it should not\
        \ be too sensitive to\\nthe small level ruggedness of the genetic landscape\
        \ described so\\nfar.\\n\\nThe Concept of Phenotypic Complexity\\nAs discussed\
        \ previously, the quantity denoted by ne is the number\\nof genetically uncorrelated\
        \ phenotypes that are influenced by the\\naction of natural selection. The\
        \ dimensions enumerated by ne are\\nthus genetically orthogonal to each other,\
        \ and analogous to the\\naxes needed to describe the variation among multiple\
        \ phenotypes\\nmeasured on a collection of individuals and mutants in a principal\\\
        ncomponent analysis. However, the number of axes enumerated by\\nne is filtered\
        \ by natural selection, while in a PCA analysis the\\nnumber of axes is limited\
        \ only by the number of independent\\nphenotypes\\nthat are measured. Because\
        \ each phenotype is\\noptimized at a value determined by each organism\u2019\
        s ecological\\nenvironment, there is a dependence of phenotypic complexity\
        \ on\\nthe complexity of\\nthe ecological niche experienced by each\\norganism;\
        \ if natural selection does not act on a phenotype, then\\nthat phenotype\
        \ does not contribute to the complexity metric.\\nFinally, although the estimates\
        \ of ne arise from an idealized model\\n\\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org\\n\\\
        n5\\n\\nFebruary 2007 |\\n\\nIssue 2 | e217\\n\\n\\fof phenotypic evolution;\
        \ as Orr suggested previously, estimates of\\nphenotypic complexity using\
        \ FGM can be viewed as \u2018\u2018effective\u2019\u2019\\nestimates of phenotypic\
        \ complexity [6]. This concept is analogous\\nto the concept in population\
        \ genetics of effective population size,\\nNe, in which two populations with\
        \ different numbers of individuals\\nand different sex ratios might have the\
        \ same effective population\\nsize and therefore respond similarly to the\
        \ different population\\ngenetic forces. Thus two organisms, although they\
        \ may differ in\\nboth the underlying genetic mechanisms and in the complexity\
        \ of\\nthe environment in which they live, may have similar phenotypic\\ncomplexities.\
        \ The utility of the concept lies not in the implications\\nit makes about\
        \ specific phenotypes or genetic details, but in that it\\nenables a general\
        \ quantification of how an organism is affected by\\nnatural selection (the\
        \ complexity with which natural selection acts),\\nand furthermore, how this\
        \ action affects\\nthe evolutionary\\ndynamics of that organism [6].\\n\\\

        \ genomes of these\\norganisms (5386 bp and 11,161bp in wX174 and VSV, respec-\\\
        ntively). This agrees with the concept of phenotypic complexity that\\nwe\
        \ have defined. Although mutations that occur at one nucleotide\\nor amino\
        \ acid do not affect\\nthey are\\ngenetically separable phenotypes), it is\
        \ clearly unlikely that each\\nnucleotide or amino acid is independently acted\
        \ up by natural\\nselection. Secondly, each estimate of complexity is greater\
        \ than the\\nnumber of genes encoded by each virus (11 and 5 for wX174 and\\\
        nVSV, respectively). The presence of multiple functional domains\\nwithin\
        \ a single protein is consistent with an estimate of complexity\\nthat is\
        \ greater than the number of encoded proteins.\\n\\nthose at another (i.e.\\\
        n\\nAlthough we have only two estimates, we can briefly consider\\nthem from\
        \ a comparative standpoint: although the genome size of\\nwX174 is half of\
        \ VSV, our estimate of phenotypic complexity\\nquantifies wX174 as being approximately\
        \ four-fold more complex.\\nIt is notable, then, that wX174 contains approximately\
        \ twice the\\nnumber of genes as VSV. Additionally, the lifestyle of wX174\
        \ is\\narguably much more elaborate than that of VSV. wX174 interacts\\nwith\
        \ several host factors in order to perform transcription and\\nreplication;\
        \ 13 host factors are required for replication alone [31].\\nThis can be contrasted\
        \ with VSV, in which transcription and\\nreplication are similar processes,\
        \ both performed by the viral\\npolymerase. Few host\\nfactors (and thus few\
        \ interactions) are\\nnecessary at all during the entire life cycle of VSV\
        \ [32].\\n\\nThese estimates suggest that, for very simple organisms such\
        \ as\\nviruses, phenotypic complexity correlates well with the number of\\\
        ngenes in an organism, and more specifically, with the number of\\ninteractions\
        \ characteristic of that organism [2]. This observation\\nsupports the idea\
        \ that phenotypic complexity depends on the\\ninteractions between an organism\
        \ and its environment. Genome\\nsize in itself seems to be a poor correlate\
        \ of phenotypic complexity,\\na notable result in consideration of the very\
        \ small genome sizes of\\nthese organisms. Whether\\nsuch correlations or\
        \ absence of\\ncorrelation with gene number or genome length would hold for\\\
        nmore complex organisms remains an open question. Nevertheless,\\nby studying\
        \ very simple organisms, we have shown that the use of\\ndrift load could\
        \ be used to estimate complexity in a novel and\\nconsistent way. We now propose\
        \ that such a method could be\\nhelpful to identify and quantify the strongest\
        \ determinants of\\nbiological complexity of higher organisms.\\n\\nAlthough\
        \ the theory presented here appears to be quite robust,\\nit is too early\
        \ to conclude that it is an accurate reflection of the\\nunderlying biology.\
        \ To be studied in an FGM framework,\\n\\nPopulation Genetic Complexity\\\
        n\\nfor population size-dependent\\n\\norganisms need to present at least\
        \ one phenotypic property to\\nselection. Additionally, populations, even\
        \ those of very small size,\\nis explicitly\\nshould evolve towards a fitness\
        \ equilibrium that\\ndependent on population size. We found data in the literature\\\
        nconsistent with this expectation for one organism, VSV. We now\\nprovide\
        \ further support\\nfitness\\nequilibria by evolving populations of the bacteriophage\
        \ wX174.\\nTogether, these two data sets suggest that evolutionary analyses\\\
        nusing an FGM framework are a valid approach. Moreover, the use\\nof very\
        \ simple organisms such as viruses is useful for gaining insight\\ninto metrics\
        \ of complexity, as for such simple organisms, gene\\nnumber is likely to\
        \ be a very good correlate of organismal\\ncomplexity, and this should be\
        \ reflected by the metric. Although\\nour observations are currently limited\
        \ to two viral species, it is\\n(i.e. population size-\\nclear that\\nfrom\
        \ both a qualitative level\\n(that the\\ndependent fitness equilibria), and\
        \ a quantitative level\\nthe\\nthat\\nnumber of phenotypic dimensions are\
        \ reasonable)\\npredictions from FGM theory are borne out. An assessment of\\\
        ndrift load and phenotypic complexity in a greater number of\\norganisms is\
        \ needed before further conclusions can be drawn.\\n\\nConclusions\\nHere\
        \ we have presented a top-down approach to quantifying\\nbiological complexity.\
        \ This can be contrasted with previously\\nproposed metrics of complexity,\
        \ which have relied on physically\\nmeasurable quantities of the organism\
        \ (bottom-up approaches).\\nTwo important conceptual differences separate\
        \ these two ap-\\nproaches. Most importantly, phenotypic complexity is dependent\\\
        non both the organism and the environmental context. An\\norganism is not\
        \ complex because it has many measurable\\nphenotypes; it is complex because\
        \ it has many phenotypes on\\nwhich natural selection acts. Secondly, phenotypic\
        \ complexity\\ndoes not rely on artificially constructed concepts such as\
        \ genes\\n[33]. As an example, if two genes are deemed to be of equal\\nsuch\
        \ a\\ncomplexity because they are functionally equivalent,\\nmeasure necessarily\
        \ ignores the subtle ways in which each may\\nbe regulated, or spliced, or\
        \ expressed within the cell. Quantify-\\ning such multiple layers of complexity\
        \ is difficult if the metric\\nrelies on physically measurable quantities.\\\
        n\\nHowever, phenotypic complexity remains an inherently abstract\\nmetric.\
        \ It cannot aid in identifying the specific characteristics\\ncontributing\
        \ to the complexity of an organism. Instead, it addresses\\nthe complexity\
        \ with which natural selection views an organism, and\\nthe complexity with\
        \ which an organism is capable of generating\\nnovel phenotypic variation.\
        \ For this reason, testing how phenotypic\\ncomplexity compares to more traditional\
        \ metrics of complexity (for\\nexample, the numbers of genes, protein interactions,\
        \ or cellular\\npathways) may provide significant insight into biological\
        \ systems.\\nFinally, phenotypic complexity (and the resulting equilibrium\
        \ drift\\nload) affords a unique opportunity to contrast the action of natural\\\
        nselection between different organisms or different environments in\\na very\
        \ general and unconstrained manner.\\n\\nMETHODS\\nViral Evolution\\nThe details\
        \ of experimental evolution of wX174 have been\\ndescribed previously [14].\

              \ and green fluorescent proteins (GFPs)14 have recently been used for\
              \ temperature\\nmapping within a living cell. However, many of these\
              \ existing methods are limited by\\ndrawbacks such as low sensitivity\
              \ and systematic errors owing to fluctuations in the\\nfluorescence\
              \ rate11, 12, the local chemical environment13 and the optical properties\
              \ of the\\nsurrounding medium14. Moreover, while promising, GFP-based\
              \ methods rely on cellular\\ntransfection14 that proves to be difficult\
              \ to achieve in certain primary cell types15. Our new\\napproach to\
              \ nanoscale thermometry utilizes the quantum mechanical spin associated\
              \ with\\nnitrogen vacancy (NV) color centers in diamond. As illustrated\
              \ in Fig. 1, in its electronic\\nground state, the NV center constitutes\
              \ a spin-1 system. These spin states can be coherently\\nmanipulated\
              \ using microwave pulses and efficiently initialized and detected via\
              \ laser\\nillumination (see SI). In the absence of an external magnetic\
              \ field, the precise value of the\\ntransition frequency (\u0394) between\
              \ the | ms = 0\u232A and |ms = \xB11\u232A states exhibits a temperature\\\
              ndependence (d\u0394/ dT =\u2212(2\u03C0)77 kHz/K) due to thermally\
              \ induced lattice strains16\u201318.\\n\\nThe operational principle\
              \ of NV-based thermometry relies upon the accurate measurement\\nof\
              \ this transition frequency, which can be optically detected with high\
              \ spatial resolution\\n(Fig. 1). For a sensor containing N color centers,\
              \ the temperature sensitivity is given by\\n\\n(1)\\n\\nwhere Tcoh is\
              \ the NV-spin coherence time and t is the integration time. Here, we\
              \ also\\nintroduce a factor C to account for imperfections in readout\
              \ and initialization19. Assuming\\nTcoh is on the order of a few milliseconds\
              \ and C \u2248 0.0319, a single NV can potentially\\nexhibit a sensitivity\
              \ better than\\nthermometry also offers several distinct advantages\
              \ over existing methods in biological and\\nchemical temperature sensing.\
              \ First, owing to diamond\u2019s chemical inertness, it is generally\\\
              nrobust to changes in the local chemical environment. Second, it can\
              \ be applied over a wide\\nrange of temperatures, 200\u2013600 K17,\
              \ 18, which is of particular interest in the study of\\nnanoscale chemical\
              \ reactions20.\\n\\n. Beyond high sensitivity, NV-based\\n\\nAs a first\
              \ benchmark experiment, we demonstrate the high temperature sensitivity\
              \ of NV-\\nbased thermometry in a bulk diamond sample. While the NV\u2019\
              s magnetic sensitivity has\\nrendered it a competitive magnetometer21,\
              \ 22, to accurately determine the temperature, it is\\nnecessary to\
              \ decouple the NV electronic spin from fluctuating external magnetic\
              \ fields. This\\nis achieved via a modified spin-echo sequence that\
              \ makes use of the spin-1 nature of the NV\\ndefect23, allowing us to\
              \ eliminate the effects of an external, slowly varying, magnetic field.\\\
              nSpecifically, we apply a microwave pulse at frequency \u03C9 (Fig.\

              \ This is achieved\\nby using nanodiamonds. In most commercially available\
              \ nanodiamonds, the NV coherence\\ntime is limited to approximately\
              \ 1 \u03BC s due to additional paramagnetic impurities. While this\\\
              nshortened coherence time reduces the intrinsic temperature sensitivity\
              \ for a single defect,\\nthis decrease can be offset by using an ensemble\
              \ of NVs to enhance the signal to noise ratio\\n\\n. Note that unlike\
              \ NV-based magnetometry, where the proximity to the\\n\\nby a factor\
              \ of\\nsource (often limited by nanodiamond size) is critical to the\
              \ maximum sensitivity, NV\\nthermometry is not subject to such a constraint;\
              \ in fact, the excellent thermal conductivity of\\ndiamond ensures that\
              \ all NV centers within a nanocrystal are in thermal equilibrium with\
              \ the\\nlocal heat environment. To maximize the number of NV centers\
              \ and to minimize the lattice\\nstrain, our measurements are performed\
              \ on single-crystalline nanodiamonds containing\\napproximately 500\
              \ NV centers (Adamas Nanotechnologies). The zero-field splitting \u0394\
              \ of the\\nNV ensemble, and thus the temperature, is determined by recording\
              \ a continuous-wave\\nelectron spin resonance (ESR) spectrum. Specifically,\
              \ we measure changes to the zero-field\\nsplitting by recording the\
              \ fluorescence at four different frequencies centered around \u0394\
              \ = 2.87\\nGHz (Fig. 3a). This procedure eliminates unwanted effects\
              \ from fluctuations in the total\\nfluorescence rate, ESR contrast,\
              \ Rabi frequency and magnetic field, yielding a robust\\nthermometer\
              \ (see Methods).\\n\\nCombining our nanodiamond thermometer with the\
              \ laser heating of a gold nanoparticle (Au\\nNP) allows us to both control\
              \ and monitor temperature at nanometer length scales (Fig. 3).\\nBoth\
              \ nanodiamonds and Au NPs (nominal diameter 100 nm) are initially spin-coated\
              \ on a\\nmicroscope coverslip. Using a confocal microscope with two\
              \ independent scanning beams,\\nwe co-localize Au NPs and nanodiamonds\
              \ with ~ 100 nm resolution (see SI). While locally\\nheating the Au\
              \ NP via continuous illumination with a variable-power green laser (focused\
              \ to\\na diffraction limited spot), we simultaneously measure the temperature\
              \ at the nanodiamond\\nlocation using ESR spectroscopy.\\n\\nThe ability\
              \ to measure temperature with NDs is verified by heating the substrate\
              \ temperature\\nover a range of 2.5 K and simultaneously monitoring\
              \ the zero-field splitting (see Fig. 3c,\\ninset). To demonstrate nano-scale\

              \ and Au NPs into human embryonic fibroblast WS1 cells via nanowire-\\\

              \ we probe the\\ntemperature at two different locations (NV1 and NV2)\
              \ within a single cell while locally\\nheating an individual Au NP (Fig.\
              \ 4a). As shown in Fig. 4b, NV1, which is significantly\\ncloser to\
              \ the heat source, exhibits a stronger temperature dependence as a function\
              \ of laser\\npower than NV2. Varying the incident power allows us to\
              \ generate controlled temperature\\ngradients of up to 5 K over distances\
              \ of approximately 7 \u03BC m. To ensure that this temperature\\ngradient\
              \ is created by the controlled illumination of the NP and does not result\
              \ from heating\\nof the cellular cytoplasm, we displace the laser spot\
              \ from the Au NP; this then results in a\\nnegligible temperature change\

              nsquare, Fig. 4b). The increased measurement uncertainty for larger\
              \ laser powers is the result\\nof heating fluctuations from drift of\
              \ the Au NP.\\n\\nThe experiments shown in Fig. 4b clearly demonstrate\
              \ the sub-micron measurement of an\\nintra-cellular heat gradient. However,\
              \ the substantial heating induced by constant\\nillumination for an\
              \ extended period of time ultimately leads to the death of the cell,\
              \ which is\\nconfirmed using a standard live/dead assay (Calcein AM/Ethidium\
              \ Homodimer-1). To\\ndemonstrate that our technique can be employed\
              \ within living cells, we increase the\\nconcentration of Au NPs to\
              \ allow for heat generation at different locations by simply\\nmoving\
              \ the laser focus. Then, we measured the temperature variation at a\

              \ heating of Au NPs in two\\ndiffering locations (crosses). After our\
              \ measurement, the viability of the cell is confirmed\\n(Fig. 4c).\\\
              n\\nFinally, we demonstrate that our method can be used to control cell\
              \ viability. To start, we\\nheat the cell with 12 \u03BC W of laser\
              \ power and measure a temperature change of 0.5 \xB1 0.2 K at\\nthe\
              \ nanodiamond location; this corresponds to a change of approximately\
              \ 10K at the Au NP\\nspot. At this point, the cell is still alive, as\
              \ confirmed by the absence of ethidium\\nhomodimer-1 fluorescence inside\
              \ the membrane (Fig. 4d). By increasing the laser power to\\n120\u03BC\

        \ scales represents an outstanding\\nchallenge in many areas of modern science\
        \ and technology1. In particular, a thermometer capable\\nof sub-degree temperature\
        \ resolution over a large range of temperatures as well as integration\\nwithin\
        \ a living system could provide a powerful new tool for many areas of biological,\
        \ physical\\nand chemical research; possibilities range from the temperature-induced\
        \ control of gene\\nexpression2\u20135 and tumor metabolism6 to the cell-selective\
        \ treatment of disease7,8 and the study of\\nheat dissipation in integrated\
        \ circuits1. By combining local light-induced heat sources with\\nsensitive\
        \ nanoscale thermometry, it may also be possible to engineer biological processes\
        \ at the\\nsub-cellular level2\u20135. Here, we demonstrate a new approach\
        \ to nanoscale thermometry that utilizes\\ncoherent manipulation of the electronic\
        \ spin associated with nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color centers\\nin diamond. We\
        \ show the ability to detect temperature variations down to 1.8 mK (sensitivity\
        \ of\\n\\n) in an ultra-pure bulk diamond sample. Using NV centers in diamond\
        \ nanocrystals\\n\\n(nanodiamonds, NDs), we directly measure the local thermal\
        \ environment at length scales down to\\n200 nm. Finally, by introducing both\
        \ nanodiamonds and gold nanoparticles into a single human\\nembryonic fibroblast,\
        \ we demonstrate temperature-gradient control and mapping at the sub-\\ncellular\

        \ organic dyes13, 14. Fluorescent\\npolymers13 and green fluorescent proteins\
        \ (GFPs)14 have recently been used for temperature\\nmapping within a living\
        \ cell. However, many of these existing methods are limited by\\ndrawbacks\
        \ such as low sensitivity and systematic errors owing to fluctuations in the\\\
        nfluorescence rate11, 12, the local chemical environment13 and the optical\
        \ properties of the\\nsurrounding medium14. Moreover, while promising, GFP-based\
        \ methods rely on cellular\\ntransfection14 that proves to be difficult to\
        \ achieve in certain primary cell types15. Our new\\napproach to nanoscale\
        \ thermometry utilizes the quantum mechanical spin associated with\\nnitrogen\
        \ vacancy (NV) color centers in diamond. As illustrated in Fig. 1, in its\
        \ electronic\\nground state, the NV center constitutes a spin-1 system. These\
        \ spin states can be coherently\\nmanipulated using microwave pulses and efficiently\
        \ initialized and detected via laser\\nillumination (see SI). In the absence\
        \ of an external magnetic field, the precise value of the\\ntransition frequency\
        \ (\u0394) between the | ms = 0\u232A and |ms = \xB11\u232A states exhibits\
        \ a temperature\\ndependence (d\u0394/ dT =\u2212(2\u03C0)77 kHz/K) due to\
        \ thermally induced lattice strains16\u201318.\\n\\nThe operational principle\
        \ of NV-based thermometry relies upon the accurate measurement\\nof this transition\
        \ frequency, which can be optically detected with high spatial resolution\\\
        n(Fig. 1). For a sensor containing N color centers, the temperature sensitivity\
        \ is given by\\n\\n(1)\\n\\nwhere Tcoh is the NV-spin coherence time and t\
        \ is the integration time. Here, we also\\nintroduce a factor C to account\
        \ for imperfections in readout and initialization19. Assuming\\nTcoh is on\
        \ the order of a few milliseconds and C \u2248 0.0319, a single NV can potentially\\\
        nexhibit a sensitivity better than\\nthermometry also offers several distinct\
        \ advantages over existing methods in biological and\\nchemical temperature\
        \ sensing. First, owing to diamond\u2019s chemical inertness, it is generally\\\
        nrobust to changes in the local chemical environment. Second, it can be applied\
        \ over a wide\\nrange of temperatures, 200\u2013600 K17, 18, which is of particular\
        \ interest in the study of\\nnanoscale chemical reactions20.\\n\\n. Beyond\
        \ high sensitivity, NV-based\\n\\nAs a first benchmark experiment, we demonstrate\
        \ the high temperature sensitivity of NV-\\nbased thermometry in a bulk diamond\
        \ sample. While the NV\u2019s magnetic sensitivity has\\nrendered it a competitive\
        \ magnetometer21, 22, to accurately determine the temperature, it is\\nnecessary\
        \ to decouple the NV electronic spin from fluctuating external magnetic fields.\
        \ This\\nis achieved via a modified spin-echo sequence that makes use of the\
        \ spin-1 nature of the NV\\ndefect23, allowing us to eliminate the effects\
        \ of an external, slowly varying, magnetic field.\\nSpecifically, we apply\
        \ a microwave pulse at frequency \u03C9 (Fig. 1b) to create a coherent\\n\\\
        n, where\\n\\nsuperposition\\nwe apply a 2\u03C0 echo-pulse that swaps the\
        \ population of the | + 1\u232A and | \u2212 1\u232A states (Fig. 2a).\\nFollowing\
        \ another period of free evolution for time \u03C4, quasi-static, magnetic-field-induced\\\
        nshifts of these |\xB11\u232A levels are eliminated, allowing for accurate\
        \ temperature sensing. In the\\nexperiment, we use a CVD-grown, isotopically\

        napproaching 0.5 ms. Interestingly, for all NVs tested, we observe a characteristic\
        \ low-\\nfrequency beating of the fluorescence signal that varies from NV\
        \ to NV, which is most\\nlikely due to locally fluctuating charge traps25.\
        \ Despite this beating, for a fixed evolution\\ntime 2\u03C4, the NV spin\

        nup to a multiple of (2d\u0394/ dT2\u03C4)\u22121, absolute temperature variations\
        \ can be determined by\\nrepeating the measurement for 2\u03C4\u2032< 2\u03C4\
        \ as shown in Fig. 2b.\\n\\n for 2\u03C4 = 250 \u03BC s. With 30 seconds of\\\
        n\\nWe now demonstrate the high spatial resolution of NV-based thermometry.\
        \ This is achieved\\nby using nanodiamonds. In most commercially available\
        \ nanodiamonds, the NV coherence\\ntime is limited to approximately 1 \u03BC\
        \ s due to additional paramagnetic impurities. While this\\nshortened coherence\
        \ time reduces the intrinsic temperature sensitivity for a single defect,\\\
        nthis decrease can be offset by using an ensemble of NVs to enhance the signal\
        \ to noise ratio\\n\\n. Note that unlike NV-based magnetometry, where the\
        \ proximity to the\\n\\nby a factor of\\nsource (often limited by nanodiamond\
        \ size) is critical to the maximum sensitivity, NV\\nthermometry is not subject\
        \ to such a constraint; in fact, the excellent thermal conductivity of\\ndiamond\
        \ ensures that all NV centers within a nanocrystal are in thermal equilibrium\
        \ with the\\nlocal heat environment. To maximize the number of NV centers\
        \ and to minimize the lattice\\nstrain, our measurements are performed on\
        \ single-crystalline nanodiamonds containing\\napproximately 500 NV centers\
        \ (Adamas Nanotechnologies). The zero-field splitting \u0394 of the\\nNV ensemble,\
        \ and thus the temperature, is determined by recording a continuous-wave\\\
        nelectron spin resonance (ESR) spectrum. Specifically, we measure changes\
        \ to the zero-field\\nsplitting by recording the fluorescence at four different\
        \ frequencies centered around \u0394 = 2.87\\nGHz (Fig. 3a). This procedure\
        \ eliminates unwanted effects from fluctuations in the total\\nfluorescence\
        \ rate, ESR contrast, Rabi frequency and magnetic field, yielding a robust\\\
        nthermometer (see Methods).\\n\\nCombining our nanodiamond thermometer with\
        \ the laser heating of a gold nanoparticle (Au\\nNP) allows us to both control\
        \ and monitor temperature at nanometer length scales (Fig. 3).\\nBoth nanodiamonds\
        \ and Au NPs (nominal diameter 100 nm) are initially spin-coated on a\\nmicroscope\
        \ coverslip. Using a confocal microscope with two independent scanning beams,\\\
        nwe co-localize Au NPs and nanodiamonds with ~ 100 nm resolution (see SI).\

        \ cells, we introduce\\nnanodiamonds and Au NPs into human embryonic fibroblast\
        \ WS1 cells via nanowire-\\nassisted delivery15. Just as in the control experiments\
        \ described above, we probe the\\ntemperature at two different locations (NV1\
        \ and NV2) within a single cell while locally\\nheating an individual Au NP\
        \ (Fig. 4a). As shown in Fig. 4b, NV1, which is significantly\\ncloser to\
        \ the heat source, exhibits a stronger temperature dependence as a function\
        \ of laser\\npower than NV2. Varying the incident power allows us to generate\
        \ controlled temperature\\ngradients of up to 5 K over distances of approximately\
        \ 7 \u03BC m. To ensure that this temperature\\ngradient is created by the\
        \ controlled illumination of the NP and does not result from heating\\nof\
        \ the cellular cytoplasm, we displace the laser spot from the Au NP; this\
        \ then results in a\\nnegligible temperature change at the location of NV1\
        \ with \u0394 T = (\u221220 \xB1 50) mK (green\\nsquare, Fig. 4b). The increased\
        \ measurement uncertainty for larger laser powers is the result\\nof heating\
        \ fluctuations from drift of the Au NP.\\n\\nThe experiments shown in Fig.\
        \ 4b clearly demonstrate the sub-micron measurement of an\\nintra-cellular\
        \ heat gradient. However, the substantial heating induced by constant\\nillumination\
        \ for an extended period of time ultimately leads to the death of the cell,\
        \ which is\\nconfirmed using a standard live/dead assay (Calcein AM/Ethidium\
        \ Homodimer-1). To\\ndemonstrate that our technique can be employed within\
        \ living cells, we increase the\\nconcentration of Au NPs to allow for heat\
        \ generation at different locations by simply\\nmoving the laser focus. Then,\
        \ we measured the temperature variation at a single\\nnanodiamond (bar plot\
        \ in Fig. 4c) while introducing a slight heating of Au NPs in two\\ndiffering\
        \ locations (crosses). After our measurement, the viability of the cell is\
        \ confirmed\\n(Fig. 4c).\\n\\nFinally, we demonstrate that our method can\
        \ be used to control cell viability. To start, we\\nheat the cell with 12\
        \ \u03BC W of laser power and measure a temperature change of 0.5 \xB1 0.2\
        \ K at\\nthe nanodiamond location; this corresponds to a change of approximately\
        \ 10K at the Au NP\\nspot. At this point, the cell is still alive, as confirmed\
        \ by the absence of ethidium\\nhomodimer-1 fluorescence inside the membrane\
        \ (Fig. 4d). By increasing the laser power to\\n120\u03BC W, we induce a temperature\
        \ change of 3.9 \xB1 0.1K at the nanodiamond location\\n(approximately 80K\
        \ at the location of the laser focus); in this case, the cell is flooded with\\\
        nfluorescence from the ethidium homodimer, thus signaling cell death. This\

        \ NDs.\\nA linear function, with slope m, is fitted to the q data (red dashed\
        \ line) and the measurement\\n\\naccuracy is given by\\nthe corresponding\
        \ laser power. The error bars are evaluated as\\n\\n, with Ti the measured\

        n\\nUltimate sensitivity\\n\\nThe ultimate sensitivity of our method is limited\
        \ by the NV coherence time and the number\\nof defect centers. In our current\
        \ experiment, we have demonstrated a sensitivity of\\n\\n (with a free evolution\
        \ time of 250 \u03BC s). Two natural extensions enable longer\\n\\nNV coherences:\
        \ 1) decreasing the 13C concentration to suppress the nuclear spin bath and\
        \ 2)\\nfurther dynamical decoupling. These methods can, in principle, allow\
        \ us to extend the\\nevolution time up to T1/2 ~ 3 ms. In combination with\
        \ a nanocrystal that contains ~ 1000\\nNV centers, this could yield an ultimate\
        \ sensitivity limit of\\nimprovement may be possible by employing spin squeezed\
        \ states. Finally, the determination\\nof absolute temperature is limited\
        \ by variations of the zero-field splitting due to spatially\\nvarying strain.\
        \ For low strain diamond samples, we find that the variation in the zero-field\\\
        nsplitting is less than 60 kHz, allowing for sub-K absolute temperature determination.\
        \ In\\naddition, the use of an ensemble of NV centers in different NDs with\
        \ uncorrelated strain\\n\\n. Further\\n\\nvalues allows for a further increase\
        \ in absolute sensitivity by a factor\\nnumber of NDs.\\n\\n, where n is the\\\
        n\\nUltimate accuracy in solution\\n\\nIn cases where our method is used to\
        \ probe a system that is in solution (e.g. cells, chemical\\nreactions), the\
        \ primary accuracy limit is set by heat dissipation during the measurement\\\
        nprocess. In particular, the microwave spectroscopy used to detect changes\
        \ in the NV zero-\\nfield splitting also induces heating of the solution.\
        \ In the present experiment, we utilize a\\nlithographically fabricated microwave\
        \ loop (diameter 200 \u03BC m) to generate an ac-magnetic\\nfield, B \u2248\
        \ 10 mGauss, for spin manipulations. Estimating the effective dipole field\
        \ created\\nby the microwave loop shows that the solution (water) absorbs\
        \ 10\u22126 W of power yielding a\\ntemperature increase of 5 mK in the steady\
        \ state. By using a smaller microwave loop (20\\n\u03BC m) and reducing the\
        \ duty cycle, it could be possible to decrease the heating of the solution\\\
        nto approximately 50 \u03BC K.\\n\\nInjection of nanodiamonds into cells\\\

              \ models are central to basic biomedical research; however, variability\
              \ exists across genetically identical mice and mouse facilities making\
              \ comparisons difficult. Whether specific indigenous gut bacteria drive\
              \ immunophenotypic variability in mouse models of human disease remains\
              \ poorly understood. We performed a large-scale experiment using 579\
              \ genetically identical laboratory mice from a single animal facility,\
              \ designed to identify the causes of disease variability in the widely\
              \ used dextran sulphate sodium mouse model of inflammatory bowel disease.\
              \ Commonly used treatment endpoint measures\u2014weight loss and intestinal\
              \ pathology\u2014showed limited correlation and varied across mouse\
              \ lineages. Analysis of the gut microbiome, coupled with machine learning\
              \ and targeted anaerobic culturing, identified and isolated two previously\
              \ undescribed species, Duncaniella muricolitica and Alistipes okayasuensis,\
              \ and demonstrated that they exert dominant effects in the dextran sulphate\
              \ sodium model leading to variable treatment endpoint measures. We show\
              \ that the identified gut microbial species are common, but not ubiquitous,\
              \ in mouse facilities around the world, and suggest that researchers\
              \ monitor for these species to provide experimental design opportunities\
              \ for improved mouse models of human intestinal diseases.\\n\\n## Main\\\
              n\\nExperimental mouse models are central to basic biomedical research\
              \ and serve as important preclinical models in drug discovery for a\
              \ variety of human diseases, including autoimmune and metabolic disorders,\
              \ cancers and infections. Unfortunately, there is tremendous variability\
              \ in disease penetrance and reproducibility among genetically identical\
              \ mice within and between mouse facilities, limiting the utility of\
              \ many commonly used models1\u20133. Specific-pathogen-free (SPF) protocols\
              \ have been successfully employed to control the confounding effects\
              \ that can be caused by known bacterial pathogens, but we lack equivalent\
              \ knowledge of the effects of the diverse, uncharacterized symbiotic\
              \ bacteria within the indigenous gut microbiota of mice. While our knowledge\
              \ of the human gut microbiota in health and disease has expanded extensively\
              \ with large-scale microbiome studies, comprehensive computational bacterial\
              \ discovery4,5 and extensive genome-sequenced bacterial collections6\u2013\
              9, equivalent investigations in mouse models have remained limited.\
              \ The vast differences in species type, composition and dispersal between\
              \ human and mouse microbiotas highlight the importance of efforts to\
              \ culture mouse-specific bacteria and to validate their functions during\
              \ intestinal homeostasis and disease10,11.\\n\\nInflammatory bowel disease\
              \ (IBD) research relies heavily on laboratory mice to understand colitis\
              \ and the role of host genetics in disease resistance and susceptibility.\
              \ Detailed immune characterization shows colitis induction with specific\

              \ spp.13,14, Enterobacteriaceae15, Bilophila wadsworthia16 or segmented\
              \ filamentous bacteria17. Potential genetic modulators of IBD are routinely\
              \ assessed through administration of dextran sulphate sodium (DSS) at\
              \ various concentrations in drinking water, which acts by damaging the\
              \ gut epithelial barrier to trigger inflammatory disease12,13. In germ-free\
              \ mice, immune-mediated colitis is largely absent although reduced barrier\
              \ function can introduce susceptibility at higher DSS concentrations18.\
              \ Similarly, dietary changes in both germ-free and SPF mice can determine\
              \ DSS susceptibility in a microbiome-dependent and -independent manner19,\
              \ and highly specific protection is provided by the presence of Clostridium\
              \ immunis20\u201323. Despite these advances, the gut microbiota in these\
              \ mouse models, including standard SPF models, is rarely profiled at\
              \ the genomic level or cultured in the laboratory, nor robustly controlled\
              \ to understand the contribution of general gut bacteria to experimental\
              \ outcomes.\\n\\nTo quantify the variability of the widely used DSS\
              \ model of IBD and to investigate primary factors contributing to this\
              \ variability, we undertook a large-scale experiment using 579 genetically\
              \ identical laboratory mice in a single animal facility. Incorporating\
              \ standardized phenotyping, microbiome analysis and metadata collection,\
              \ this approach was designed to identify and validate the causes of\
              \ variability for standard experimental endpoints (weight loss and intestinal\
              \ pathology). Using a data-driven approach we identified, from gut microbiome\
              \ data, candidate bacterial taxa driving weight loss and intestinal\
              \ inflammation. Functional validation with cultured isolates suggests\
              \ that these specific bacterial strains can determine experimental outcomes\
              \ in gnotobiotic mice. Thus, using an experimental approach for microbiome\
              \ discovery, we identified the previously undescribed mouse gut bacteria\
              \ Duncaniella muricolitica and Alistipes okayasuensis, found frequently\
              \ in mouse colonies around the world, that impact outcomes in the DSS\
              \ model of colitis and may be acting as pathobionts.\\n\\n## Results\\\
              n\\n### Disease severity is highly variable in the DSS mouse model\\\
              n\\nWe administered 1.5% DSS through the drinking water for 7 days to\
              \ 579 identically housed, SPF wild-type C57BL/6N mice (297 males, 282\
              \ females; median age 11 weeks; s.d. 12 days) from 14 distinct parental\
              \ lineages (that is, founder matings derived from a single breeding\
              \ pair). We observed extensive variability in experimental endpoints\
              \ in these genetically identical mice at 10 days post DSS treatment,\
              \ with histological assessment of intestinal pathology of the mid and\
              \ distal colon ranging from severe inflammation, characterized by extensive\
              \ crypt loss, leukocytic infiltration and edema, to no visible inflammation\
              \ (Fig. 1a,b). Substantial variation was also observed in the weight\
              \ change of mice treated with DSS, with the response ranging from 12%\
              \ weight gain to 30% weight loss across the cohort (Fig. 1c). Regression\
              \ analysis considering histology scores and weight loss demonstrated\
              \ limited correlation (R2 = 0.27), suggesting that weight loss and intestinal\
              \ pathology outcomes, common experimental endpoint measures in the DSS\
              \ model, may be partially independent responses to DSS (Fig. 1d). This\
              \ relationship is consistent with systemic complications contributing\
              \ to experimental endpoints in the DSS model.Fig. 1Disease severity\

              \ of variable response to DSS\\n\\nTo identify the primary factors determining\
              \ disease outcome, we established a random forest classifier model incorporating\
              \ mouse sex, age, lineage, parents, mouse room and experimental date\
              \ to assess the relative importance of each of these factors (Extended\
              \ Data Fig. 1). The strongest predictive factor for weight loss and\
              \ histology score, both together and independently in these genetically\
              \ identical C57BL/6N mice maintained under standardized SPF conditions\
              \ within the same facility, was parental lineage, with correlation analysis\
              \ confirming these associations (P < 0.01, Kruskal\u2013Wallis; Extended\
              \ Data Fig. 1).\\n\\nSince all mice were derived from the same genetic\
              \ founder stock, the most likely mediator of their DSS phenotype was\
              \ an extrinsic lineage-specific factor. However, to exclude the role\
              \ of host genetics or epigenetic differences between colonies, and to\
              \ determine whether the microbiota alone could be responsible for the\
              \ observed phenotypic variation, fecal samples were collected from SPF\
              \ mice (without DSS treatment) from parental lineages that represented\
              \ extremes of disease outcome and were used to colonize C57BL/6N germ-free\
              \ mice. These colonized recipient mice were then subjected to DSS treatment\
              \ involving daily weight measurements, with colon sections collected\
              \ and analyzed histologically 10 days after the initiation of DSS treatment.\
              \ Recipient mice exhibited both weight loss and pathology scores not\
              \ statistically different from those observed in the respective donor\
              \ mouse lineages, but differing significantly between disease- and non-associated\
              \ lineages (P = 0.0002, paired t-test; Fig. 2a). From these results\
              \ it is clear that, independent of other factors such as host genetics\
              \ or epigenetic lineage-specific factors, the microbiota is sufficient\
              \ to produce the observed variation in phenotypic response to DSS administration.Fig.\

              \ Discovery of bacteria that drive disease variability\\n\\nHaving established\
              \ the importance of the microbiota in mediation of phenotypic outcomes\
              \ to DSS in genetically identical mice, we next sought to understand\
              \ the degree of variability in the mouse microbiota across a single\
              \ facility, and to define changes in the microbiota that occur with\
              \ DSS treatment. Fecal samples were collected before DSS treatment and\
              \ 10 days after DSS exposure, and subjected to taxonomic profiling with\
              \ 16 S ribosomal RNA amplicon sequencing to determine microbiota community\
              \ composition. Consistent with previous reports of gastrointestinal\
              \ inflammation, this analysis demonstrated a clear separation of microbiome\
              \ community between pre- and post-DSS samples (Fig. 2b,c and Extended\
              \ Data Figs. 2 and 3) and a significant reduction in bacterial diversity\
              \ (Shannon diversity index, P = 0.0357; Fig. 2d)12. Although expansion\
              \ of Proteobacteria is often associated with gut microbiome dysbiosis,\
              \ while an increase in Proteobacteria was observed post DSS (P < 0.05,\
              \ Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test), limited association was observed between\
              \ weight loss and Proteobacteria proportion either pre (Fig. 2e; Spearman\
              \ correlation, 0.196) or post DSS treatment (Fig. 2e; Spearman correlation,\
              \ \u22120.289). This suggests that other gut bacteria may be contributing\
              \ to the observed variation in DSS resistance and susceptibility.\\\
              n\\nGiven the transmissibility of disease phenotype we observed in the\
              \ germ-free mouse experiments, we reasoned that the observed phenotypic\
              \ variation was primarily dependent on baseline microbiota composition\
              \ before DSS treatment. To understand the composition of microbiota\
              \ associated with increased risk of disease outcome, we applied linear\
              \ discriminant analysis to gut microbiota composition before and after\
              \ DSS exposure24. This unsupervised analysis leveraged the variability\
              \ between mouse lineage-specific bacteria to identify the bacterial\
              \ taxa that most closely predict DSS response. Using this approach,\
              \ we identified two statistically different bacterial taxa associated\
              \ with no disease, and five statistically different bacterial taxa associated\
              \ with >5% weight loss. Notably, no relationship was observed between\
              \ the occurrence or abundance of these isolates in mice before DSS exposure,\
              \ and equivalent predictive bacterial taxa were not identified within\
              \ the microbiota of mice after DSS exposure. Our results suggest that\
              \ the presence of specific gut bacterial taxa before DSS exposure may\
              \ influence disease severity and outcome, possibly by either priming\
              \ or protection from disease.\\n\\n### Isolation of bacterial species\
              \ for functional validation\\n\\nWhile we show clear associations between\
              \ specific bacterial taxa and DSS-mediated disease outcome using 16\
              \ S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing, accurate taxonomic identification\
              \ to strain level and experimental validation require the isolation\
              \ and genome sequencing of pure clonal cultures of bacterial strains.\
              \ To target and purify bacterial strains, we next performed broad-based\
              \ culture of ~2,000 bacterial colonies from mouse fecal samples. The\
              \ resulting isolates were identified by capillary 16 S rRNA gene sequencing\
              \ and included four previously identified bacterial taxa, two \u2018\
              disease associated\u2019 and two \u2018health associated\u2019. These\
              \ isolates were subjected to whole-genome sequencing and genomic analysis\
              \ to aid in precise taxonomic and phylogenetic assignment (Extended\
              \ Data Fig. 4). In addition, we performed extensive phenotypic characterization\
              \ and comparative genome analyses of these four species (Methods) as\
              \ a basis to provisionally name the health-associated bacteria Anaerostipes\
              \ faecis and Sangeribacter muris and the disease-associated bacteria\
              \ Duncaniella muricolitica and Alistipes okayasuensis; of note, the\
              \ last three species are mouse specific. Examination of the relative\
              \ abundance of each of these species before DSS treatment identified\
              \ significantly higher levels of A. faecis (P = 0264, t-test) and S.\
              \ muris (P = 0.0010, t-test) in those mice without weight loss, and\
              \ significantly higher levels of D. muricolitica (P = 0.0351, t-test)\
              \ and A. okayasuensis (P = 0.0006, t-test) in mice that experienced\
              \ >5% weight loss (Fig. 2f).\\n\\nWe next repeated the DSS experimental\
              \ model in either germ-free mice or germ-free mice stably monocolonized\
              \ for 4 weeks with one of these four bacterial strains (Extended Data\
              \ Figs. 5a and 6). Control germ-free mice treated with DSS neither lost\
              \ weight (Fig. 3a) nor experienced mortality (Fig. 3b) over the course\
              \ of the experiment, suggesting that the presence of gut bacteria is\
              \ important in triggering overt disease in our facility. Comparable\
              \ experimental outcomes were observed in DSS-treated, germ-free mice\
              \ monocolonized with either of the health-associated bacteria, which\
              \ did not lose weight or develop intestinal pathology (Fig. 3a) nor\
              \ experienced significant mortality (Fig. 3b). In contrast, when DSS-treated\
              \ mice were monocolonized with either of the disease-associated bacteria,\
              \ we observed more rapid and greater weight loss (Fig. 3a) and significantly\
              \ reduced survival (Fig. 3b). Therefore, we identified and validated\
              \ D. muricolitica and A. okayasuensis as mouse bacteria that can promote\
              \ disease not observed in mice monocolonized with the commensal bacteria\

              \ data\\n\\nTo understand inflammatory immune responses in the intestine\
              \ potentially caused by disease-associated versus health-associated\
              \ species, we next examined histology, immune cell populations and cytokine\
              \ production. The human-colonizing A. faecis and the facility-prevalent\
              \ D. muricolitica were chosen as exemplary disease- and health-associated\
              \ bacteria, respectively, for these analyses. Flow cytometric analysis\
              \ of intestinal lamina propria leukocytes isolated from germ-free mice\
              \ monocolonized for 4 weeks with either A. faecis or D. muricolitica\
              \ revealed that colonization with either strain did not significantly\
              \ impact the composition of intestinal leukocyte and lymphocyte subsets\
              \ (Extended Data Figs. 5b,c and 6). However, the perturbation and epithelial\
              \ disruption induced by DSS led to significantly increased inflammatory\
              \ CD64+CD11c+ monocytes/macrophages in the lamina propria compartment\
              \ of the large intestine in D. muricolitica monocolonized mice, but\
              \ not in A. faecis monocolonized mice (Extended Data Figs. 5c,d and\
              \ 6). These monocytes have been shown to play a pathogenic role in the\
              \ intestine in the context of Helicobacter-induced inflammation25. This\
              \ suggests that, although neither pathogenic nor immunogenic at homeostasis,\
              \ D. muricolitica drives increased inflammatory responses in the wake\
              \ of epithelial damage whereas health-associated A. faecis does not.\
              \ Importantly, while histological samples taken after 7 days of DSS\
              \ treatment from colons and caeca of D. muricolitica monocolonized mice\
              \ occasionally exhibited features of severe inflammation, this was not\
              \ statistically different from that of A. faecis monocolonized mice\
              \ (Fig. 3c,d) and did not consistently correspond to the weight loss\
              \ observed. This again suggests that weight loss in the DSS model may\
              \ not always correlate with intestinal inflammation and pathology.\\\
              n\\nTo determine whether the presence of D. muricolitica or A. faecis\
              \ had a positive or negative correlation with weight change, we next\
              \ examined 20 independent mice and assessed the relationship between\
              \ bacterial levels using quantitative PCR (qPCR) before DSS treatment\
              \ and weight change observed at day 10. This analysis identified a positive\
              \ correlation between weight change and pre-DSS A. faecis abundance\
              \ (R = 0.3679, P = 0.0046; Fig. 3e). Similarly, a negative correlation\
              \ was observed between weight change and D. muricolitica abundance (R2\
              \ = 0.3626, P = 0.0050; Fig. 3e). This independent confirmation provides\
              \ further validation of the relationship between these species and the\
              \ severity of DSS colitis; however, additional work is needed to confirm\
              \ their roles as pathobionts.\\n\\n### Global distribution and prevalence\
              \ in other mouse facilities\\n\\nBecause D. muricolitica and A. okayasuensis\
              \ affected the outcome of DSS colitis in our mouse facility, we next\
              \ explored the presence and distribution of these bacteria in other\
              \ mouse facilities around the world. To do so, we first generated a\
              \ global representation of laboratory mouse intestinal microbiomes by\
              \ curating 582 publicly available shotgun metagenome samples from \u2018\
              control\u2019, SPF mice. We combined this dataset with shotgun metagenomes\
              \ from feces of 40 mice at the Wellcome Sanger Institute to yield a\
              \ global mouse gut microbiome dataset covering 31 institutes across\
              \ 12 countries. We then determined the prevalence and abundance of health-associated\
              \ bacteria S. muris and A. faecis and disease-associated bacteria D.\
              \ muricolitica and A. okayasuensis in this mouse microbiome dataset.\\\
              n\\nDuncaniella muricolitica and A. okayasuensis were both dominant\
              \ members of the mouse microbiome, present in 54.5 and 47.9% of samples\
              \ and with a mean abundance of 0.52 and 0.48% reads per sample, respectively.\
              \ Importantly, D. muricolitica and A. okayasuensis were each detected\
              \ in 80.6% (25/31) of the institutes included in the analyses (Fig.\
              \ 4), and there were only three institutes that did not contain either\
              \ of these species. For comparison, among health-associated species\
              \ S. muris was the most dominant in the mouse gut microbiota, present\
              \ in 96.5% of samples with a mean abundance of 6.2% reads, while A.\
              \ faecis was a relatively minor species, present in 5.9% of samples\
              \ with a mean abundance of 0.22% reads. S. muris was present in all\
              \ (31/31) of the institutes included in the analyses, whereas A. faecis\
              \ was detected in 25.8% (8/31). The abundance of each species also differed\
              \ between institutes (Fig. 4). Thus, we show that mouse-derived bacteria\
              \ cultured from our institute are common mouse symbionts and, importantly,\
              \ D. muricolitica and A. okayasuensis are common, but not ubiquitous,\

              n\\nWe administered 1.5% DSS through the drinking water for 7 days to\
              \ 579 identically housed, SPF wild-type C57BL/6N mice (297 males, 282\
              \ females; median age 11 weeks; s.d. 12 days) from 14 distinct parental\
              \ lineages (that is, founder matings derived from a single breeding\
              \ pair). We observed extensive variability in experimental endpoints\
              \ in these genetically identical mice at 10 days post DSS treatment,\
              \ with histological assessment of intestinal pathology of the mid and\
              \ distal colon ranging from severe inflammation, characterized by extensive\
              \ crypt loss, leukocytic infiltration and edema, to no visible inflammation\
              \ (Fig. 1a,b). Substantial variation was also observed in the weight\
              \ change of mice treated with DSS, with the response ranging from 12%\
              \ weight gain to 30% weight loss across the cohort (Fig. 1c). Regression\
              \ analysis considering histology scores and weight loss demonstrated\
              \ limited correlation (R2 = 0.27), suggesting that weight loss and intestinal\
              \ pathology outcomes, common experimental endpoint measures in the DSS\
              \ model, may be partially independent responses to DSS (Fig. 1d). This\
              \ relationship is consistent with systemic complications contributing\

              \ variable response to DSS\\n\\nTo identify the primary factors determining\
              \ disease outcome, we established a random forest classifier model incorporating\
              \ mouse sex, age, lineage, parents, mouse room and experimental date\
              \ to assess the relative importance of each of these factors (Extended\
              \ Data Fig. 1). The strongest predictive factor for weight loss and\
              \ histology score, both together and independently in these genetically\
              \ identical C57BL/6N mice maintained under standardized SPF conditions\
              \ within the same facility, was parental lineage, with correlation analysis\
              \ confirming these associations (P < 0.01, Kruskal\u2013Wallis; Extended\
              \ Data Fig. 1).\\n\\nSince all mice were derived from the same genetic\
              \ founder stock, the most likely mediator of their DSS phenotype was\
              \ an extrinsic lineage-specific factor. However, to exclude the role\
              \ of host genetics or epigenetic differences between colonies, and to\
              \ determine whether the microbiota alone could be responsible for the\
              \ observed phenotypic variation, fecal samples were collected from SPF\
              \ mice (without DSS treatment) from parental lineages that represented\
              \ extremes of disease outcome and were used to colonize C57BL/6N germ-free\
              \ mice. These colonized recipient mice were then subjected to DSS treatment\
              \ involving daily weight measurements, with colon sections collected\
              \ and analyzed histologically 10 days after the initiation of DSS treatment.\
              \ Recipient mice exhibited both weight loss and pathology scores not\
              \ statistically different from those observed in the respective donor\
              \ mouse lineages, but differing significantly between disease- and non-associated\
              \ lineages (P = 0.0002, paired t-test; Fig. 2a). From these results\
              \ it is clear that, independent of other factors such as host genetics\
              \ or epigenetic lineage-specific factors, the microbiota is sufficient\
              \ to produce the observed variation in phenotypic response to DSS administration.Fig.\

              \ Discovery of bacteria that drive disease variability\\n\\nHaving established\
              \ the importance of the microbiota in mediation of phenotypic outcomes\
              \ to DSS in genetically identical mice, we next sought to understand\
              \ the degree of variability in the mouse microbiota across a single\
              \ facility, and to define changes in the microbiota that occur with\
              \ DSS treatment. Fecal samples were collected before DSS treatment and\
              \ 10 days after DSS exposure, and subjected to taxonomic profiling with\
              \ 16 S ribosomal RNA amplicon sequencing to determine microbiota community\
              \ composition. Consistent with previous reports of gastrointestinal\
              \ inflammation, this analysis demonstrated a clear separation of microbiome\
              \ community between pre- and post-DSS samples (Fig. 2b,c and Extended\
              \ Data Figs. 2 and 3) and a significant reduction in bacterial diversity\
              \ (Shannon diversity index, P = 0.0357; Fig. 2d)12. Although expansion\
              \ of Proteobacteria is often associated with gut microbiome dysbiosis,\
              \ while an increase in Proteobacteria was observed post DSS (P < 0.05,\
              \ Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test), limited association was observed between\
              \ weight loss and Proteobacteria proportion either pre (Fig. 2e; Spearman\
              \ correlation, 0.196) or post DSS treatment (Fig. 2e; Spearman correlation,\
              \ \u22120.289). This suggests that other gut bacteria may be contributing\
              \ to the observed variation in DSS resistance and susceptibility.\\\
              n\\nGiven the transmissibility of disease phenotype we observed in the\
              \ germ-free mouse experiments, we reasoned that the observed phenotypic\
              \ variation was primarily dependent on baseline microbiota composition\
              \ before DSS treatment. To understand the composition of microbiota\
              \ associated with increased risk of disease outcome, we applied linear\
              \ discriminant analysis to gut microbiota composition before and after\
              \ DSS exposure24. This unsupervised analysis leveraged the variability\
              \ between mouse lineage-specific bacteria to identify the bacterial\
              \ taxa that most closely predict DSS response. Using this approach,\
              \ we identified two statistically different bacterial taxa associated\
              \ with no disease, and five statistically different bacterial taxa associated\
              \ with >5% weight loss. Notably, no relationship was observed between\
              \ the occurrence or abundance of these isolates in mice before DSS exposure,\
              \ and equivalent predictive bacterial taxa were not identified within\
              \ the microbiota of mice after DSS exposure. Our results suggest that\
              \ the presence of specific gut bacterial taxa before DSS exposure may\
              \ influence disease severity and outcome, possibly by either priming\
              \ or protection from disease.\\n\\n## Isolation of bacterial species\
              \ for functional validation\\n\\nWhile we show clear associations between\
              \ specific bacterial taxa and DSS-mediated disease outcome using 16\
              \ S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing, accurate taxonomic identification\
              \ to strain level and experimental validation require the isolation\
              \ and genome sequencing of pure clonal cultures of bacterial strains.\
              \ To target and purify bacterial strains, we next performed broad-based\
              \ culture of ~2,000 bacterial colonies from mouse fecal samples. The\
              \ resulting isolates were identified by capillary 16 S rRNA gene sequencing\
              \ and included four previously identified bacterial taxa, two \u2018\
              disease associated\u2019 and two \u2018health associated\u2019. These\
              \ isolates were subjected to whole-genome sequencing and genomic analysis\
              \ to aid in precise taxonomic and phylogenetic assignment (Extended\
              \ Data Fig. 4). In addition, we performed extensive phenotypic characterization\
              \ and comparative genome analyses of these four species (Methods) as\
              \ a basis to provisionally name the health-associated bacteria Anaerostipes\
              \ faecis and Sangeribacter muris and the disease-associated bacteria\
              \ Duncaniella muricolitica and Alistipes okayasuensis; of note, the\
              \ last three species are mouse specific. Examination of the relative\
              \ abundance of each of these species before DSS treatment identified\
              \ significantly higher levels of A. faecis (P = 0264, t-test) and S.\
              \ muris (P = 0.0010, t-test) in those mice without weight loss, and\
              \ significantly higher levels of D. muricolitica (P = 0.0351, t-test)\
              \ and A. okayasuensis (P = 0.0006, t-test) in mice that experienced\
              \ >5% weight loss (Fig. 2f).\\n\\nWe next repeated the DSS experimental\
              \ model in either germ-free mice or germ-free mice stably monocolonized\
              \ for 4 weeks with one of these four bacterial strains (Extended Data\
              \ Figs. 5a and 6). Control germ-free mice treated with DSS neither lost\
              \ weight (Fig. 3a) nor experienced mortality (Fig. 3b) over the course\
              \ of the experiment, suggesting that the presence of gut bacteria is\
              \ important in triggering overt disease in our facility. Comparable\
              \ experimental outcomes were observed in DSS-treated, germ-free mice\
              \ monocolonized with either of the health-associated bacteria, which\
              \ did not lose weight or develop intestinal pathology (Fig. 3a) nor\
              \ experienced significant mortality (Fig. 3b). In contrast, when DSS-treated\
              \ mice were monocolonized with either of the disease-associated bacteria,\
              \ we observed more rapid and greater weight loss (Fig. 3a) and significantly\
              \ reduced survival (Fig. 3b). Therefore, we identified and validated\
              \ D. muricolitica and A. okayasuensis as mouse bacteria that can promote\
              \ disease not observed in mice monocolonized with the commensal bacteria\

              \ potentially caused by disease-associated versus health-associated\
              \ species, we next examined histology, immune cell populations and cytokine\
              \ production. The human-colonizing A. faecis and the facility-prevalent\
              \ D. muricolitica were chosen as exemplary disease- and health-associated\
              \ bacteria, respectively, for these analyses. Flow cytometric analysis\

              \ monocolonized for 4 weeks with either A. faecis or D. muricolitica\
              \ revealed that colonization with either strain did not significantly\
              \ impact the composition of intestinal leukocyte and lymphocyte subsets\
              \ (Extended Data Figs. 5b,c and 6). However, the perturbation and epithelial\
              \ disruption induced by DSS led to significantly increased inflammatory\
              \ CD64+CD11c+ monocytes/macrophages in the lamina propria compartment\
              \ of the large intestine in D. muricolitica monocolonized mice, but\
              \ not in A. faecis monocolonized mice (Extended Data Figs. 5c,d and\
              \ 6). These monocytes have been shown to play a pathogenic role in the\
              \ intestine in the context of Helicobacter-induced inflammation25. This\
              \ suggests that, although neither pathogenic nor immunogenic at homeostasis,\
              \ D. muricolitica drives increased inflammatory responses in the wake\
              \ of epithelial damage whereas health-associated A. faecis does not.\
              \ Importantly, while histological samples taken after 7 days of DSS\
              \ treatment from colons and caeca of D. muricolitica monocolonized mice\
              \ occasionally exhibited features of severe inflammation, this was not\
              \ statistically different from that of A. faecis monocolonized mice\
              \ (Fig. 3c,d) and did not consistently correspond to the weight loss\
              \ observed. This again suggests that weight loss in the DSS model may\
              \ not always correlate with intestinal inflammation and pathology.\\\

              \ had a positive or negative correlation with weight change, we next\
              \ examined 20 independent mice and assessed the relationship between\
              \ bacterial levels using quantitative PCR (qPCR) before DSS treatment\
              \ and weight change observed at day 10. This analysis identified a positive\
              \ correlation between weight change and pre-DSS A. faecis abundance\
              \ (R = 0.3679, P = 0.0046; Fig. 3e). Similarly, a negative correlation\
              \ was observed between weight change and D. muricolitica abundance (R2\
              \ = 0.3626, P = 0.0050; Fig. 3e). This independent confirmation provides\
              \ further validation of the relationship between these species and the\
              \ severity of DSS colitis; however, additional work is needed to confirm\
              \ their roles as pathobionts.\\n\\n## Global distribution and prevalence\
              \ in other mouse facilities\\n\\nBecause D. muricolitica and A. okayasuensis\
              \ affected the outcome of DSS colitis in our mouse facility, we next\
              \ explored the presence and distribution of these bacteria in other\
              \ mouse facilities around the world. To do so, we first generated a\
              \ global representation of laboratory mouse intestinal microbiomes by\
              \ curating 582 publicly available shotgun metagenome samples from \u2018\
              control\u2019, SPF mice. We combined this dataset with shotgun metagenomes\
              \ from feces of 40 mice at the Wellcome Sanger Institute to yield a\
              \ global mouse gut microbiome dataset covering 31 institutes across\
              \ 12 countries. We then determined the prevalence and abundance of health-associated\
              \ bacteria S. muris and A. faecis and disease-associated bacteria D.\
              \ muricolitica and A. okayasuensis in this mouse microbiome dataset.\\\
              n\\nDuncaniella muricolitica and A. okayasuensis were both dominant\
              \ members of the mouse microbiome, present in 54.5 and 47.9% of samples\
              \ and with a mean abundance of 0.52 and 0.48% reads per sample, respectively.\
              \ Importantly, D. muricolitica and A. okayasuensis were each detected\
              \ in 80.6% (25/31) of the institutes included in the analyses (Fig.\
              \ 4), and there were only three institutes that did not contain either\
              \ of these species. For comparison, among health-associated species\
              \ S. muris was the most dominant in the mouse gut microbiota, present\
              \ in 96.5% of samples with a mean abundance of 6.2% reads, while A.\
              \ faecis was a relatively minor species, present in 5.9% of samples\
              \ with a mean abundance of 0.22% reads. S. muris was present in all\
              \ (31/31) of the institutes included in the analyses, whereas A. faecis\
              \ was detected in 25.8% (8/31). The abundance of each species also differed\
              \ between institutes (Fig. 4). Thus, we show that mouse-derived bacteria\
              \ cultured from our institute are common mouse symbionts and, importantly,\
              \ D. muricolitica and A. okayasuensis are common, but not ubiquitous,\
              \ in animal facilities around the world.Fig. 4Global epidemiology and\

              n\\n## Discussion\\n\\nDespite experimental variability in the DSS mouse\
              \ model, which limits the interpretation and translation of data, the\
              \ model is increasingly used in basic research (>6,000 DSS model publications\
              \ on PubMed) and by the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries.\
              \ Cohousing, heterozygote mating and other experimental procedures have\
              \ been used in an attempt to normalize the microbiota within experiments\
              \ and ensure direct measures of the effects of mouse genetic background\
              \ on disease phenotype rather than indirect and unknown microbiota-associated\
              \ effects26. In our approach we leveraged this variability in DSS outcome,\
              \ in combination with microbiome analysis, machine learning, anerobic\
              \ culturing and germ-free mouse validation experiments, to gain relevant\
              \ biological insight into microbiota determinants of DSS disease. While\
              \ this consideration of the microbiome did not completely eliminate\
              \ the impact of multidimensionality in the DSS model, we identified\
              \ and undertook experimental validation of D. muricolitica and A. okayasuensis,\
              \ both of which have a dominant effect on DSS outcome.\\n\\nInterestingly,\
              \ D. muricolitica and A. okayasuensis are phylogenetically distinct\
              \ from each other and neither had computationally predicted virulence\
              \ factors within their genome. While it remains unclear how these isolates\
              \ contribute to DSS disease, both exhibit a potential for polysaccharide\
              \ utilization that may mediate this relationship through interaction\
              \ with the mucus layer. We also noted that weight loss and intestinal\
              \ pathology do not always correlate, so they should not necessarily\
              \ be used as surrogates for each other. Similarly, substantial weight\
              \ loss was observed in monocolonized mice even in the absence of severe\
              \ inflammation, suggesting that activation of key pathways alone can\
              \ have a substantial impact on experimental outcome. Together, these\
              \ insights raise the need for further experimental study of host interactions\
              \ and the biology of these important mouse-specific bacteria.\\n\\nWe\
              \ propose that researchers should consider monitoring for D. muricolitica\
              \ and A. okayasuensis in their mouse facilities, as is undertaken for\
              \ other immunophenotyped-affecting microbes such as segmented filamentous\
              \ bacteria27. In some cases, precolonization of animals with these bacteria,\
              \ if they are not present in the facility, may yield better experimental\
              \ control and increase confidence in this important and widely used\
              \ mouse model of human disease. Overall, our work suggests that the\
              \ application of metagenomics techniques to report microbiota composition,\
              \ in addition to the genetic and disease phenotypes being described,\
              \ should represent a standard minimum requirement for the DSS mouse\
              \ model. We have deposited the D. muricolitis, A. okayasuensis, S. muris\
              \ and A. faecis strains and genomes in public repositories to support\
              \ this work.\\n\\n## Methods\\n\\n### Mouse models\\n\\nMice were maintained\
              \ under either germ-free or SPF conditions at the Wellcome Sanger Institute\
              \ Home Office-approved facility, with all procedures carried out in\
              \ accordance with the United Kingdom Animals (Scientific Procedures)\
              \ Act of 1986 under Home Office approval (PPL no. 80/2643). Germ-free\
              \ mice were maintained in positive-pressure isolators (Bell), with feces\
              \ tested by culture, microscopy and PCR to ensure sterility. Consumables\
              \ were autoclaved at 121 \xB0C for 15 min before introduction into the\
              \ isolators. For experimentation, cages were opened in a vaporized hydrogen\
              \ peroxide-sterilized, class II cabinet (Bioquell), with fecal transplant\
              \ and monocolonized gnotobiotic lines generated by weekly oral gavage\
              \ over a 3-week period. Materials were prepared in Dulbecco\u2019s PBS\
              \ at 100 mg ml\u20131 immediately before administration under anaerobic\
              \ conditions (10% H, 10% CO2, 80% N) in a Whitley DG250 workstation\
              \ at 37 \xB0C (ref. 8). Mice were maintained in sterile ISOcages (Tecniplast)\
              \ and housed on ISOrack for the period of the experiment.\\n\\n### DSS\
              \ colitis challenge\\n\\nDextran sulphate sodium was administered at\
              \ a concentration of 1.5% (w/v) (Affymetrix, Inc., average molecular\
              \ weight 44 kDa) in drinking water for 7 days, followed by 3 days with\
              \ regular drinking water, to C57BL6/6N mice aged 7\u201316 weeks (297\
              \ male, 282 female; median age 11 weeks; s.d. 12 days). Mice were weighed\
              \ every day and culled if weight loss reached 20% of starting weight.\
              \ Average weight loss curves were censored for each group when the first\
              \ member of the group reached this endpoint, to avoid misleading calculations\
              \ of the average using the remaining members. No statistical methods\
              \ were used to predetermine sample sizes in these experiments.\\n\\\
              n### Histological assessment of intestinal inflammation\\n\\nDextran\
              \ sulphate sodium-treated SPF mice were sacrificed at day 10 by cervical\
              \ dislocation, and samples from mid and distal colon taken. Tissue sections\
              \ were fixed in buffered 10% formalin, paraffin embedded, cut and stained\
              \ with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Colon histopathology was blind-graded\
              \ semiquantitatively, on a scale from zero to three, for four criteria:\
              \ (1) degree of epithelial hyperplasia/damage and goblet cell depletion;\
              \ (2) leukocyte infiltration in lamina propria; (3) area of tissue affected;\
              \ and (4) presence of markers of severe inflammation, including crypt\
              \ abscesses, submucosal inflammation and edema. Scores for individual\
              \ criteria were added for an overall inflammation score of between zero\
              \ and 12 for each sample. Scores from mid and distal colon were then\
              \ averaged to obtain inflammation scores for each mouse colon.\\n\\\
              nMonocolonized, germ-free mice were euthanized 7 days after DSS administration\
              \ and samples taken from the cecum and midcolon. Tissue sections were\
              \ fixed in methacarn, paraffin embedded, sectioned and stained with\
              \ H&E. Colon and cecum histopathology was graded on a semiquantitative\
              \ scale by a pathologist blinded to the groups. The criteria scored\
              \ were (1) degree of epithelial hyperplasia/damage and goblet cell depletion;\
              \ (2) severity of leukocyte infiltration in lamina propria; (3) extent\
              \ of inflammation; and (4) presence of markers of severe inflammation,\
              \ including crypt abscesses, submucosal inflammation and edema. Each\
              \ criterion was scored on a scale of zero to three based on previously\
              \ described thresholds28 and the sum of the individual scores was recorded\
              \ as an indication of overall inflammation. For all animal experiments,\
              \ treatments were randomized by cage by researchers blinded to treatment\
              \ conditions. For statistical analysis, distribution was assumed to\
              \ be normal but this was not formally tested\\n\\n### Bacterial culture\\\
              n\\nFecal samples and bacterial isolates were cultured for anaerobic\
              \ gastrointestinal bacteria under anaerobic conditions (10% H, 10% CO2,\
              \ 80% N) in a Whitley DG250 workstation at 37 \xB0C (ref. 8). Fecal\
              \ samples were homogenized in reduced PBS (0.1 g ml\u20131 PBS), serially\
              \ diluted and plated directly onto YCFA agar supplemented with 0.002\
              \ g ml\u22121 each of glucose, maltose and cellobiose. Colonies were\
              \ picked, restreaked to purity and identified using 16 S rRNA gene sequencing.\\\
              n\\n### Microbiota profiling and analysis\\n\\nFecal samples were collected\
              \ directly from mice and immediately stored at \u221280 \xB0C until\
              \ DNA extraction. DNA was extracted from samples using the FastDNA Spin\
              \ Kit for Soil (MPBio) and stored at \u221220 \xB0C until metagenomic\
              \ sequencing. DNA samples were quantified using a Qubit 4 Fluorometer\
              \ (Thermo Fisher). 16 S rRNA amplicon-based profiling was performed\
              \ using the FastDNA Spin Kit for Soil (MP Biomedicals) on 300 mg of\
              \ fecal sample from each mouse. The V1\u2013V2 region of 16 S rRNA genes\
              \ was amplified with a Q5 High-Fidelity Polymerase Kit (New England\
              \ Biolabs): F': AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACAC-TATGGTAATT-CC-AGMGTTYGATYMTGGCTCAG;\
              \ R': CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGATACGAGACTGATTAGTCAGTCAGAAGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAG.\
              \ Each PCR amplification was performed as four independent amplifications\
              \ and pooled in equimolar amounts for 150-base-paired (bp)-end sequencing\
              \ with the Illumina MiSeq platform. For shotgun metagenomic sequencing,\
              \ samples with >100 ng of DNA material were processed onward to paired-end\
              \ (2 \xD7 150 bp) metagenomics sequencing on the HiSeq 4000 platform\
              \ as per standard manufacturer library preparation and sequencing protocols.\\\
              n\\n### Metagenomic data analysis\\n\\nAnalysis of 16 S rRNA amplicon\
              \ sequences was performed with mothur MiSeq SOP v.1.42.3 using SILVA\
              \ v.132 (ref. 29). The 16 S rRNA gene alignments were used to determine\
              \ maximum likelihood phylogeny using FastTree v.2.1.10 (ref. 30). Phylogenetic\
              \ trees were visualized and edited using iTOL31. Shotgun metagenomic\
              \ reads were filtered for quality and adapter sequences using KneadData\
              \ v.0.7.3, with default settings. Host reads were removed from samples\
              \ using the GRCm39 reference genome and Bowtie2 v.2.3.5. In addition,\
              \ reads were aligned to the Phi X 174 genome and removed. Taxonomic\
              \ classification of metagenomic reads was performed using Kraken2 v.2.0.8\
              \ and a custom database built from the genomes of the Mouse Gut Bacterial\
              \ Catalog (MGBC).\\n\\nAll data analyses were performed in R v.4.0.2.\
              \ Species abundant at \u22650.01% reads were considered present in a\
              \ sample, and operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were considered statistically\
              \ different at P < 0.05. For shotgun metagenomic sequencing, relative\
              \ abundance of species was corrected using Bracken v.2.5.2. Bar plots\
              \ for species prevalence data and sample numbers were generated using\
              \ the ggplot2 v.3.3.3 package. To quantify and visualize intrainstitute\
              \ abundance, species abundance data for each sample underwent Bayesian\
              \ multiplicative replacement of zero counts using the zCompositions\
              \ v.1.3.4 package, and the data transformed using center log-ratio normalization.\
              \ Mean abundance per sample was then calculated and visualized using\
              \ the pheatmap v.1.0.12 package. Principal component analyses were performed\
              \ in R, and linear regression analysis was performed using the linear\
              \ regression function in python scikit-learn v.0.20.4. Alpha diversity\
              \ was assessed using Vegan v.2.5.6 (ref. 30). Correlation analysis was\
              \ performed using Spearman\u2019s rank correlation coefficient.\\n\\\
              n### Curation of public metagenome samples\\n\\nTo assess the abundance\
              \ of both health- and disease-associated bacteria in mice from different\
              \ institutes, we curated publicly available fecal shotgun metagenomes\
              \ for healthy, control SPF mice from NCBI and ENA. These samples included\
              \ mice from different genetic backgrounds and strains, but samples were\
              \ excluded if mice were younger than 3 weeks, had received antimicrobial\
              \ treatment or dietary intervention or had gene knockout. In total 582\
              \ fecal shotgun metagenomes were curated.\\n\\n### qPCR of bacterial\
              \ load\\n\\nAnaerostipes faecis and D. muricolitica were quantified\
              \ in the feces of SPF mice using qPCR with custom primers. Primers were\
              \ designed using the taxon-linked gene catalog of MGBC32. Briefly, we\
              \ identified gene targets that were both unique to, and highly conserved\
              \ in, the genome of each species. To ensure target specificity, we selected\
              \ gene clusters that shared <50% sequence identity with all nontarget\
              \ species sequences. Gene targets were defined as highly conserved if\
              \ they were identified in 100% of high-quality target species genomes\
              \ in the MGBC. Furthermore, only single-copy-number gene targets were\
              \ considered. Sequences for selected gene products were then clustered\
              \ at 90% sequence identity and used as templates for design of PCR primers\
              \ with NCBI Primer-BLAST33, ensuring specificity against the NCBI nonredundant\
              \ gene catalog. Two primers for each species were used in conjunction\
              \ for qPCR.\\n\\nPrimers: A14_1 (gene target: MGBC000029_00009), forward\

              \ double-distilled H2O. Eluted DNA was then diluted 1:50 and qPCR performed\
              \ using SYBR Green chemistry (Thermo Fisher). To approximate the relative\
              \ abundance of target species in SPF feces, cycle threshold values were\
              \ normalized to those of a universal bacterial 16 S primer (F: 5'- GTGSTGCAYGGYTGTCGTCA-3';\

              n\\nLarge intestines were excised and separated from mesentery and fat.\
              \ Transluminal sections were taken from the cecum and distal colon for\
              \ histology. The intestines were opened longitudinally, cleared of feces\
              \ then washed three times in cold PBS. To isolate intraepithelial immune\
              \ populations, the large intestines were cut into 1-cm pieces, washed\
              \ in cold PBS then incubated in 10 ml of PBS + 1 mM dithiothreitol for\

              \ N.L. masc./fem. adj. okayasuensis) is named after Isao Okayasu, who\
              \ first described DSS colitis as a model for ulcerative colitis in mice.\
              \ Phylogenomic analyses place strain A61T in the Alistipes cluster.\
              \ The digital DNA\u2013DNA hybridization (dDDH) value between A. onderdonkii\
              \ and A. putredinis is 24.4%, while dDDH values between strain A61T,\
              \ A. onderdonkii and A. putredinis are 25.2 and 21.4%, respectively.\
              \ The G + C content difference between the genome of strain A61T and\
              \ A. onderdonkii, its closest phylogenomic neighbor, is 1.39%, while\
              \ their 16S rRNA gene sequence identity is 96.03%. These analyses strongly\
              \ indicate that \u2018Alistipes okayasuensis\u2019 is a separate species\
              \ within the genus Alistipes.\\n\\nThis strain is a strict anaerobe.\
              \ Carbon source utilization analysis was combined with reconstruction\
              \ of Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) metabolic pathways\
              \ (55.58% of 2,022 predicted open reading frames (ORFs) could be annotated)\
              \ to functionally characterize the strain. The strain encodes 47 genes\
              \ predicted to be carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes), including 29\
              \ glycoside hydrolases: seven beta-glucosidases (GH3, EC 3.2.1.21);\
              \ five beta-galactosidases (EC 3.2.1.23); five endohydrolytic alpha-glucosidases\
              \ (GH13), including four alpha-amylases (EC 3.2.1.1); three exohydrolytic\
              \ alpha-glucosidases (GH31, EC 3.2.1.20); three cellulases (EC 3.2.1.4);\
              \ three mannan endo-1,4-beta-mannosidases (EC 3.2.1.78); and an alpha-l-fucosidase\
              \ (EC 3.2.1.51). Despite this predicted hydrolytic potential, the strain\
              \ shows limited capacity to utilize disaccharides and oligosaccharides\
              \ as sole carbon sources. While the strain tested positive for utilization\
              \ of alpha-d-lactose, sucrose and maltotriose, it tested negative for\
              \ utilization of d-cellobiose, dextrin, cyclodextrin, gentiobiose, lactulose,\
              \ maltose, d-melezitose, d-melibiose, palatinose, d-raffinose, stachyose,\
              \ d-trehalose, fucose or turanose.\\n\\nThe strain is predicted to encode\
              \ enzymes for metabolism of l-histidine to l-glutamate via 4-Imidazolone-5-phsophate\
              \ (EC 4.3.1.3, EC 4.2.1.49, EC 3.5.2.7, EC 2.1.2.5). In support of these\
              \ predictions, the strain is capable of utilizing urocanate as a sole\
              \ carbon source. In keeping with other members of the genus Alistipes,\
              \ this strain is predicted to encode a putative tryptophanase (EC 4.1.99.1)\
              \ that would allow it to hydrolyze tryptophan to indole. The strain\
              \ is also predicted to encode a butyrate phosphotransferase (EC 2.3.1.19)\
              \ and a butyrate kinase (EC 2.7.2.7), indicating its potential to metabolize\
              \ butyrate. The genome is 2,329,524 bp with a G + C content of 56.45\
              \ mol%. We propose the name \u2018Alistipes okayasuensis\u2019 for this\
              \ previously undescribed species, in reference to the origins of the\
              \ DSS colitis model and reflecting this species\u2019 association with\
              \ poor outcomes of this disease model. The type strain is A61T (=CCUG\
              \ 75087T =SM 112987T).\\n\\n#### Description of \u2018Anaerostipes faecis\u2019\

              \ of feces, referring to fecal origin). The closest phylogenomic neighbor\
              \ of strain A14T is Anaerostipes caccae, with a dDDH value of 48.40%.\
              \ The pairwise 16 S rRNA gene sequence identity of A14T and A. caccae\
              \ DSM 14662T is 98.16%. These analyses indicate that A14T is a separate\
              \ species within the genus Anaerostipes. The genome is 3,200,246 bp\
              \ with a G + C content of 43.77 mol%. We propose the name \u2018Anaerostipes\
              \ faecis\u2019 for this new species. The type strain is A14T (=CCUG\
              \ 75084T).\\n\\nThe strain is strictly anaerobic. Reconstruction of\
              \ KEGG metabolic pathways (55.4% of 3,222 predicted ORFs could be annotated)\
              \ indicates that the strain can produce butyrate via a butyrate phosphotransferase/butyrate\
              \ kinase operon (EC 2.7.2.7, EC 2.3.1.91), in keeping with the genus\
              \ type species A. caccae. Likewise, the strain is predicted to encode\
              \ an arginine dihydrolase (EC 3.5.3.6). In contrast to the genus description,\
              \ however, this strain is predicted to encode neither an alpha-galactosidase\
              \ (EC 3.2.1.22) nor a phosphoamidase (EC 3.9.1.1).\\n\\nThe strain shows\
              \ limited capacity to utilize monosaccharides as sole carbon sources:\
              \ it had a robust phenotype for utilization of 3-methyl-d-glucose but\
              \ tested negative for its ability to utilize other monosaccharides including\
              \ d-fructose, d-galactose, d-mannose or d-glucose as sole carbon sources.\
              \ Notably, the strain is predicted to encode the complete Leloir pathway\
              \ for galactose metabolism, as well as multiple beta-galactosidases\
              \ (EC 3.2.1.23), indicating that it might lack a galactose transporter\
              \ but could metabolize galactose in different contexts such as downstream\
              \ of other pathways of carbohydrate metabolism. The strain can utilize\
              \ some disaccharides, testing positive for sucrose utilization, potentially\
              \ via multiple oligo-1,6-glucosidases (EC 3.2.1.10), d-trehalose utilization,\
              \ potentially via three trehalases (EC 3.2.1.28, GH37, GH65) and turanose\
              \ utilization. However, the strain tested negative for its ability to\
              \ utilize alpha-d-lactose, lactulose, maltose, d-melibiose, gentiobiose,\
              \ d-cellobiose or palatinose. Additionally, the strain tested negative\
              \ for utilization of the trisccharides maltotriose, d-melezitose and\
              \ d-raffinose and the tetrasaccharide stachyose\u2014potentially due\
              \ to the absence of a predicted alpha-galactosidase. The strain could\
              \ utilize beta-cyclodextrin, but tested negative for utilization of\
              \ dextrin and alpha-cyclodextrin. The strain is capable of utilizing\
              \ alpha-ketovaleric acid and d-malic acid, as well as certain amino\
              \ acids and derivatives including l-threonine, l-asparagine, l-serine\
              \ and the dipeptides glycyl-l-proline and l-alanyl-l-threonine. The\
              \ strain tested negative for utilization of l-glutamine, l-glutamate,\
              \ l-valine and l-alanine.\\n\\n#### Description of \u2018Duncaniella\

              \ are 95.14 and 93.00%, respectively, indicating that A60T is a separate\
              \ species within the Duncaniella cluster. The dDDH value between A60T\
              \ and D. dubosii H5T is 28.10%, confirming a separate species status.\\\
              n\\nRecent work benchmarking an average nucleotide identity1 approach\
              \ to define genus boundaries found that the genus inflection points\

              \ 0.195/72.07). The corresponding values between A60T and the genus\
              \ type species D. muris are 0.243/80.85, providing further evidence\
              \ that A60T belongs to the genus Duncaniella.\\n\\nThe strain is an\

              \ of 3,461 predicted ORFs could be annotated) indicated that strain\
              \ is enriched for enzymes with glycoside hydrolase activity, encoding\
              \ 47 in total. The strain is able to utilize dextrin, beta-cyclodextrin\
              \ and multiple oligosaccharides including d-melezitose, maltotriose,\
              \ amygdalin, maltose, gentiobiose (EC: 3.2.1.21), turanose and d-cellobiose\
              \ (EC: 2.4.1.20; EC: 3.2.1.21). The strain is capable of utilizing d-raffinose,\
              \ and is predicted from its genome to produce sucrose as an intermediate\
              \ (EC: 3.2.1.22, EC: 3.2.1.20) rather than stachyose or melibiose. Additionally,\
              \ the strain tested negative for utilization of both stachyose and melibiose.\
              \ In our study the strain tested negative for an ability to utilize\
              \ lactose as a single carbon source, even though it encodes seven predicted\
              \ beta-galactosidases (EC 3.2.1.23). The strain is predicted to encode\
              \ 36 glycosyltransferase enzymes, among which are seven GT2 family enzymes\
              \ including two dolichyl-phosphate beta-d-mannosyltransferases (EC:\

              \ d-fructose (EC 2.7.1.4), d-mannitol (EC 1.1.1.67), d-mannose, d-galactose,\
              \ alpha- and beta-methyl-d-galactoside, d-galacturonic acid, l-sorbitol\
              \ (EC 1.1.1.14) and l-fucose (EC 3.2.1.51). This strain tested negative\
              \ for its ability to utilize adonitol, dulcitol or d-gluconate as single\
              \ carbon sources.\\n\\nThe strain tested positive for its ability to\
              \ utilize certain amino acids and their derivatives, including l-phenylalanine,\
              \ l-asparagine, l-glutamate, l-glutamine, l-alanine and l-valine, as\
              \ well as dipeptides including l-alanyl-l-threonine, l-alanyl-l-glutamine,\
              \ l-alanyl-l-histidine, glycyl-l-aspartate, glycyl-l-glutamine and glycyl-l-proline.\
              \ It tested negative for an ability to utilize glycyl-l-proline, l-serine,\
              \ l-aspartate or l-threonine as single carbon sources. The strain is\
              \ predicted to encode a tryptophanase (EC 4.1.99.1), indicating that\
              \ it has potential to hydrolyze tryptophan to indole. The strain tested\
              \ negative for utilization of propionate or hydroxybutyrate as sole\
              \ carbon sources, indicating that it may not consume these short-chain\
              \ fatty acids in vivo. The genome is 3,532,505 bp with a G + C content\
              \ of 46.70 mol%. We propose the name \u2018Sangeribacter muris\u2019\
              \ for this new species, reflecting its high abundance and prevalence\
              \ in mice and its initial isolation from a murine host. The type strain\
              \ is A43T (=CCUG 75085T)\\n\\n### BioLog analysis\\n\\nIsolates were\
              \ streaked on YCFA agar media and grown overnight. Cotton swabs were\
              \ used to remove colonies that were then inoculated into AN-IF Inoculating\
              \ Fluid (Technopath, no. 72007) to a turbidity of 65% using a turbidimeter.\
              \ Then, 100 \xB5l was pipetted into each well of Anaerobe AN Microplates\
              \ (Technopath, no. 1007) containing 95 different carbon sources. The\
              \ plates were sealed in PM Gas Bags (Technopath, no. 3032) and run on\
              \ the Omnilog system for 24 h. For each isolate, between three and five\
              \ replicates were run on different days from different starting colonies.\
              \ Data were analyzed using the CarboLogR application34. The quality-filtered\
              \ CarboLogR output is provided in Supplementary Table 2.\\n\\n### Reporting\
              \ Summary\\n\\nFurther information on research design is available in\
              \ the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.\\n\\\
              n## Mouse models\\n\\nMice were maintained under either germ-free or\
              \ SPF conditions at the Wellcome Sanger Institute Home Office-approved\
              \ facility, with all procedures carried out in accordance with the United\
              \ Kingdom Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act of 1986 under Home Office\
              \ approval (PPL no. 80/2643). Germ-free mice were maintained in positive-pressure\
              \ isolators (Bell), with feces tested by culture, microscopy and PCR\
              \ to ensure sterility. Consumables were autoclaved at 121 \xB0C for\
              \ 15 min before introduction into the isolators. For experimentation,\
              \ cages were opened in a vaporized hydrogen peroxide-sterilized, class\
              \ II cabinet (Bioquell), with fecal transplant and monocolonized gnotobiotic\
              \ lines generated by weekly oral gavage over a 3-week period. Materials\
              \ were prepared in Dulbecco\u2019s PBS at 100 mg ml\u20131 immediately\
              \ before administration under anaerobic conditions (10% H, 10% CO2,\
              \ 80% N) in a Whitley DG250 workstation at 37 \xB0C (ref. 8). Mice were\
              \ maintained in sterile ISOcages (Tecniplast) and housed on ISOrack\
              \ for the period of the experiment.\\n\\n## DSS colitis challenge\\\
              n\\nDextran sulphate sodium was administered at a concentration of 1.5%\
              \ (w/v) (Affymetrix, Inc., average molecular weight 44 kDa) in drinking\
              \ water for 7 days, followed by 3 days with regular drinking water,\
              \ to C57BL6/6N mice aged 7\u201316 weeks (297 male, 282 female; median\
              \ age 11 weeks; s.d. 12 days). Mice were weighed every day and culled\
              \ if weight loss reached 20% of starting weight. Average weight loss\
              \ curves were censored for each group when the first member of the group\
              \ reached this endpoint, to avoid misleading calculations of the average\
              \ using the remaining members. No statistical methods were used to predetermine\
              \ sample sizes in these experiments.\\n\\n## Histological assessment\
              \ of intestinal inflammation\\n\\nDextran sulphate sodium-treated SPF\
              \ mice were sacrificed at day 10 by cervical dislocation, and samples\
              \ from mid and distal colon taken. Tissue sections were fixed in buffered\
              \ 10% formalin, paraffin embedded, cut and stained with hematoxylin\
              \ and eosin (H&E). Colon histopathology was blind-graded semiquantitatively,\
              \ on a scale from zero to three, for four criteria: (1) degree of epithelial\
              \ hyperplasia/damage and goblet cell depletion; (2) leukocyte infiltration\
              \ in lamina propria; (3) area of tissue affected; and (4) presence of\
              \ markers of severe inflammation, including crypt abscesses, submucosal\
              \ inflammation and edema. Scores for individual criteria were added\
              \ for an overall inflammation score of between zero and 12 for each\
              \ sample. Scores from mid and distal colon were then averaged to obtain\
              \ inflammation scores for each mouse colon.\\n\\nMonocolonized, germ-free\
              \ mice were euthanized 7 days after DSS administration and samples taken\
              \ from the cecum and midcolon. Tissue sections were fixed in methacarn,\
              \ paraffin embedded, sectioned and stained with H&E. Colon and cecum\
              \ histopathology was graded on a semiquantitative scale by a pathologist\
              \ blinded to the groups. The criteria scored were (1) degree of epithelial\
              \ hyperplasia/damage and goblet cell depletion; (2) severity of leukocyte\
              \ infiltration in lamina propria; (3) extent of inflammation; and (4)\
              \ presence of markers of severe inflammation, including crypt abscesses,\
              \ submucosal inflammation and edema. Each criterion was scored on a\
              \ scale of zero to three based on previously described thresholds28\
              \ and the sum of the individual scores was recorded as an indication\
              \ of overall inflammation. For all animal experiments, treatments were\
              \ randomized by cage by researchers blinded to treatment conditions.\
              \ For statistical analysis, distribution was assumed to be normal but\
              \ this was not formally tested\\n\\n## Bacterial culture\\n\\nFecal\
              \ samples and bacterial isolates were cultured for anaerobic gastrointestinal\
              \ bacteria under anaerobic conditions (10% H, 10% CO2, 80% N) in a Whitley\
              \ DG250 workstation at 37 \xB0C (ref. 8). Fecal samples were homogenized\
              \ in reduced PBS (0.1 g ml\u20131 PBS), serially diluted and plated\
              \ directly onto YCFA agar supplemented with 0.002 g ml\u22121 each of\
              \ glucose, maltose and cellobiose. Colonies were picked, restreaked\
              \ to purity and identified using 16 S rRNA gene sequencing.\\n\\n##\
              \ Microbiota profiling and analysis\\n\\nFecal samples were collected\
              \ directly from mice and immediately stored at \u221280 \xB0C until\
              \ DNA extraction. DNA was extracted from samples using the FastDNA Spin\
              \ Kit for Soil (MPBio) and stored at \u221220 \xB0C until metagenomic\
              \ sequencing. DNA samples were quantified using a Qubit 4 Fluorometer\
              \ (Thermo Fisher). 16 S rRNA amplicon-based profiling was performed\
              \ using the FastDNA Spin Kit for Soil (MP Biomedicals) on 300 mg of\
              \ fecal sample from each mouse. The V1\u2013V2 region of 16 S rRNA genes\
              \ was amplified with a Q5 High-Fidelity Polymerase Kit (New England\
              \ Biolabs): F': AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACAC-TATGGTAATT-CC-AGMGTTYGATYMTGGCTCAG;\
              \ R': CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGATACGAGACTGATTAGTCAGTCAGAAGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAG.\
              \ Each PCR amplification was performed as four independent amplifications\
              \ and pooled in equimolar amounts for 150-base-paired (bp)-end sequencing\
              \ with the Illumina MiSeq platform. For shotgun metagenomic sequencing,\
              \ samples with >100 ng of DNA material were processed onward to paired-end\
              \ (2 \xD7 150 bp) metagenomics sequencing on the HiSeq 4000 platform\
              \ as per standard manufacturer library preparation and sequencing protocols.\\\
              n\\n## Metagenomic data analysis\\n\\nAnalysis of 16 S rRNA amplicon\
              \ sequences was performed with mothur MiSeq SOP v.1.42.3 using SILVA\
              \ v.132 (ref. 29). The 16 S rRNA gene alignments were used to determine\
              \ maximum likelihood phylogeny using FastTree v.2.1.10 (ref. 30). Phylogenetic\
              \ trees were visualized and edited using iTOL31. Shotgun metagenomic\
              \ reads were filtered for quality and adapter sequences using KneadData\
              \ v.0.7.3, with default settings. Host reads were removed from samples\
              \ using the GRCm39 reference genome and Bowtie2 v.2.3.5. In addition,\
              \ reads were aligned to the Phi X 174 genome and removed. Taxonomic\
              \ classification of metagenomic reads was performed using Kraken2 v.2.0.8\
              \ and a custom database built from the genomes of the Mouse Gut Bacterial\
              \ Catalog (MGBC).\\n\\nAll data analyses were performed in R v.4.0.2.\
              \ Species abundant at \u22650.01% reads were considered present in a\
              \ sample, and operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were considered statistically\
              \ different at P < 0.05. For shotgun metagenomic sequencing, relative\
              \ abundance of species was corrected using Bracken v.2.5.2. Bar plots\
              \ for species prevalence data and sample numbers were generated using\
              \ the ggplot2 v.3.3.3 package. To quantify and visualize intrainstitute\
              \ abundance, species abundance data for each sample underwent Bayesian\
              \ multiplicative replacement of zero counts using the zCompositions\
              \ v.1.3.4 package, and the data transformed using center log-ratio normalization.\
              \ Mean abundance per sample was then calculated and visualized using\
              \ the pheatmap v.1.0.12 package. Principal component analyses were performed\
              \ in R, and linear regression analysis was performed using the linear\
              \ regression function in python scikit-learn v.0.20.4. Alpha diversity\
              \ was assessed using Vegan v.2.5.6 (ref. 30). Correlation analysis was\
              \ performed using Spearman\u2019s rank correlation coefficient.\\n\\\
              n## Curation of public metagenome samples\\n\\nTo assess the abundance\
              \ of both health- and disease-associated bacteria in mice from different\
              \ institutes, we curated publicly available fecal shotgun metagenomes\
              \ for healthy, control SPF mice from NCBI and ENA. These samples included\
              \ mice from different genetic backgrounds and strains, but samples were\
              \ excluded if mice were younger than 3 weeks, had received antimicrobial\
              \ treatment or dietary intervention or had gene knockout. In total 582\
              \ fecal shotgun metagenomes were curated.\\n\\n## qPCR of bacterial\
              \ load\\n\\nAnaerostipes faecis and D. muricolitica were quantified\
              \ in the feces of SPF mice using qPCR with custom primers. Primers were\
              \ designed using the taxon-linked gene catalog of MGBC32. Briefly, we\
              \ identified gene targets that were both unique to, and highly conserved\
              \ in, the genome of each species. To ensure target specificity, we selected\
              \ gene clusters that shared <50% sequence identity with all nontarget\
              \ species sequences. Gene targets were defined as highly conserved if\
              \ they were identified in 100% of high-quality target species genomes\
              \ in the MGBC. Furthermore, only single-copy-number gene targets were\
              \ considered. Sequences for selected gene products were then clustered\
              \ at 90% sequence identity and used as templates for design of PCR primers\
              \ with NCBI Primer-BLAST33, ensuring specificity against the NCBI nonredundant\
              \ gene catalog. Two primers for each species were used in conjunction\
              \ for qPCR.\\n\\nPrimers: A14_1 (gene target: MGBC000029_00009), forward\
              \ 5'-AGCTGTTCAGGTGTCTGATCTT-3', reverse 5'-CGGTCCACTTCGCAGTATCA-3',\
              \ product size 74 bp; A14_2 (gene target: MGBC000029_00377), forward\
              \ 5'-ATGCAGCACTGGGAGATTCA-3', reverse 5'-CTGCGTGTCCACAGAAGAGT-3', product\
              \ size 70 bp; A60_1 (gene target: MGBC109741_00862), forward 5'-CCATCTTTTCGGACGGTGGA-3',\
              \ reverse 5'-CGAGGTCTCCCTGAAACGAC-3', product size 125 bp; A60_2 (gene\
              \ target: MGBC140600_00802), forward 5'- AAAACGGTGACAGCTCGGAA-3', reverse\
              \ 5'- GTCTCTTTTTGGCGGATGGG-3', product size 93 bp.\\n\\nDNA was extracted\
              \ from feces using FastDNA Spin Kit for Soil (MPBio) according to the\
              \ manufacturer\u2019s instructions, and DNA eluted into 100 \xB5l of\
              \ double-distilled H2O. Eluted DNA was then diluted 1:50 and qPCR performed\
              \ using SYBR Green chemistry (Thermo Fisher). To approximate the relative\
              \ abundance of target species in SPF feces, cycle threshold values were\
              \ normalized to those of a universal bacterial 16 S primer (F: 5'- GTGSTGCAYGGYTGTCGTCA-3';\
              \ R: 5'- ACGTCRTCCMCACCTTCCTC-3').\\n\\n## Intestinal immune cell isolation\\\
              n\\nLarge intestines were excised and separated from mesentery and fat.\
              \ Transluminal sections were taken from the cecum and distal colon for\
              \ histology. The intestines were opened longitudinally, cleared of feces\
              \ then washed three times in cold PBS. To isolate intraepithelial immune\
              \ populations, the large intestines were cut into 1-cm pieces, washed\
              \ in cold PBS then incubated in 10 ml of PBS + 1 mM dithiothreitol for\
              \ 10 min. Tissues were manually disrupted via shaking and then strained,\
              \ with supernatant then collected. Tissues were incubated in 10 ml of\
              \ PBS + 30 mM EDTA + 10 ml of HEPES at 37 \xB0C and 200 r.p.m., before\
              \ being shaken and strained. The supernatants from these two steps were\
              \ pooled, filtered at 70 \xB5m and the filtrate fractionated using a\
              \ discontinuous Percoll gradient (80/40%). Epithelial cells were isolated\
              \ from the surface of the Percoll, and intraepithelial immune cells\
              \ isolated from the interface.\\n\\nTo access the lamina propria compartment,\
              \ tissues were manually chopped and digested in HBSS + 25 mM HEPES +\
              \ 1 mM sodium pyruvate containing 0.05 mg ml\u20131 Collagenase VIII\
              \ (Sigma) and 50 \xB5g ml\u20131 DNase I (Sigma) for 1 h at 37 \xB0\
              C and 80 r.p.m. Samples were mechanically disrupted and filtered at\
              \ 70 \xB5m. The filtrate was fractionated using a discontinuous Percoll\
              \ gradient (80/40%). Lamina propria immune cells were isolated from\
              \ the interface.\\n\\n## Flow cytometry\\n\\nIntestinal and mesenteric\
              \ lymph node immune cell populations were characterized by flow cytometry.\
              \ For intracellular cytokine staining, cells were incubated in T cell\
              \ medium (RPMI, 10% FBS, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 2 mM GLUTamax, 1\xD7\
              \ nonessential amino acids, 0.1 mM 2-\u03B2-mercaptoethanol, 10 mM HEPES,\
              \ 1% penicillin/streptomycin) + 1\xD7 Cell Stimulation Cocktail with\
              \ Protein Inhibitors (eBioscience) for 3 h at 37 \xB0C before staining.\
              \ Nonviable cells were stained using Live/Dead Fixable Aqua. Cells were\
              \ permeabilized with CytoFix/CytoPerm (BD), followed by intracellular\
              \ staining in PermBuffer (eBioscience).\\n\\nAll antibodies were purchased\
              \ from eBioscience unless otherwise indicated. Antibodies used were\

              \ first described DSS colitis as a model for ulcerative colitis in mice.\
              \ Phylogenomic analyses place strain A61T in the Alistipes cluster.\
              \ The digital DNA\u2013DNA hybridization (dDDH) value between A. onderdonkii\
              \ and A. putredinis is 24.4%, while dDDH values between strain A61T,\
              \ A. onderdonkii and A. putredinis are 25.2 and 21.4%, respectively.\
              \ The G + C content difference between the genome of strain A61T and\
              \ A. onderdonkii, its closest phylogenomic neighbor, is 1.39%, while\
              \ their 16S rRNA gene sequence identity is 96.03%. These analyses strongly\
              \ indicate that \u2018Alistipes okayasuensis\u2019 is a separate species\
              \ within the genus Alistipes.\\n\\nThis strain is a strict anaerobe.\
              \ Carbon source utilization analysis was combined with reconstruction\
              \ of Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) metabolic pathways\
              \ (55.58% of 2,022 predicted open reading frames (ORFs) could be annotated)\
              \ to functionally characterize the strain. The strain encodes 47 genes\
              \ predicted to be carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes), including 29\
              \ glycoside hydrolases: seven beta-glucosidases (GH3, EC 3.2.1.21);\
              \ five beta-galactosidases (EC 3.2.1.23); five endohydrolytic alpha-glucosidases\

              \ three mannan endo-1,4-beta-mannosidases (EC 3.2.1.78); and an alpha-l-fucosidase\
              \ (EC 3.2.1.51). Despite this predicted hydrolytic potential, the strain\
              \ shows limited capacity to utilize disaccharides and oligosaccharides\
              \ as sole carbon sources. While the strain tested positive for utilization\
              \ of alpha-d-lactose, sucrose and maltotriose, it tested negative for\
              \ utilization of d-cellobiose, dextrin, cyclodextrin, gentiobiose, lactulose,\

              \ d-trehalose, fucose or turanose.\\n\\nThe strain is predicted to encode\
              \ enzymes for metabolism of l-histidine to l-glutamate via 4-Imidazolone-5-phsophate\
              \ (EC 4.3.1.3, EC 4.2.1.49, EC 3.5.2.7, EC 2.1.2.5). In support of these\
              \ predictions, the strain is capable of utilizing urocanate as a sole\
              \ carbon source. In keeping with other members of the genus Alistipes,\
              \ this strain is predicted to encode a putative tryptophanase (EC 4.1.99.1)\
              \ that would allow it to hydrolyze tryptophan to indole. The strain\
              \ is also predicted to encode a butyrate phosphotransferase (EC 2.3.1.19)\
              \ and a butyrate kinase (EC 2.7.2.7), indicating its potential to metabolize\
              \ butyrate. The genome is 2,329,524 bp with a G + C content of 56.45\
              \ mol%. We propose the name \u2018Alistipes okayasuensis\u2019 for this\
              \ previously undescribed species, in reference to the origins of the\
              \ DSS colitis model and reflecting this species\u2019 association with\

              \ The pairwise 16 S rRNA gene sequence identity of A14T and A. caccae\
              \ DSM 14662T is 98.16%. These analyses indicate that A14T is a separate\
              \ species within the genus Anaerostipes. The genome is 3,200,246 bp\
              \ with a G + C content of 43.77 mol%. We propose the name \u2018Anaerostipes\
              \ faecis\u2019 for this new species. The type strain is A14T (=CCUG\
              \ 75084T).\\n\\nThe strain is strictly anaerobic. Reconstruction of\
              \ KEGG metabolic pathways (55.4% of 3,222 predicted ORFs could be annotated)\
              \ indicates that the strain can produce butyrate via a butyrate phosphotransferase/butyrate\
              \ kinase operon (EC 2.7.2.7, EC 2.3.1.91), in keeping with the genus\
              \ type species A. caccae. Likewise, the strain is predicted to encode\
              \ an arginine dihydrolase (EC 3.5.3.6). In contrast to the genus description,\
              \ however, this strain is predicted to encode neither an alpha-galactosidase\
              \ (EC 3.2.1.22) nor a phosphoamidase (EC 3.9.1.1).\\n\\nThe strain shows\
              \ limited capacity to utilize monosaccharides as sole carbon sources:\
              \ it had a robust phenotype for utilization of 3-methyl-d-glucose but\
              \ tested negative for its ability to utilize other monosaccharides including\
              \ d-fructose, d-galactose, d-mannose or d-glucose as sole carbon sources.\
              \ Notably, the strain is predicted to encode the complete Leloir pathway\
              \ for galactose metabolism, as well as multiple beta-galactosidases\
              \ (EC 3.2.1.23), indicating that it might lack a galactose transporter\
              \ but could metabolize galactose in different contexts such as downstream\
              \ of other pathways of carbohydrate metabolism. The strain can utilize\
              \ some disaccharides, testing positive for sucrose utilization, potentially\
              \ via multiple oligo-1,6-glucosidases (EC 3.2.1.10), d-trehalose utilization,\
              \ potentially via three trehalases (EC 3.2.1.28, GH37, GH65) and turanose\
              \ utilization. However, the strain tested negative for its ability to\
              \ utilize alpha-d-lactose, lactulose, maltose, d-melibiose, gentiobiose,\
              \ d-cellobiose or palatinose. Additionally, the strain tested negative\
              \ for utilization of the trisccharides maltotriose, d-melezitose and\
              \ d-raffinose and the tetrasaccharide stachyose\u2014potentially due\
              \ to the absence of a predicted alpha-galactosidase. The strain could\
              \ utilize beta-cyclodextrin, but tested negative for utilization of\
              \ dextrin and alpha-cyclodextrin. The strain is capable of utilizing\
              \ alpha-ketovaleric acid and d-malic acid, as well as certain amino\
              \ acids and derivatives including l-threonine, l-asparagine, l-serine\
              \ and the dipeptides glycyl-l-proline and l-alanyl-l-threonine. The\
              \ strain tested negative for utilization of l-glutamine, l-glutamate,\

              \ (EC: 3.2.1.22, EC: 3.2.1.20) rather than stachyose or melibiose. Additionally,\

              \ room and experimental date to assess the relative importance of each\
              \ of these factors (Extended Data Fig. 1). The strongest predictive\
              \ factor for weight loss and histology score, both together and independently\
              \ in these genetically identical C57BL/6N mice maintained under standardized\

              \ correlation analysis confirming these associations (P < 0.01, Kruskal\u2013\
              Wallis; Extended Data Fig. 1).Since all mice were derived from the same\
              \ genetic founder stock, the most likely mediator of their DSS phenotype\
              \ was an extrinsic lineage-specific factor. However, to exclude the\
              \ role of host genetics or epigenetic differences between colonies,\
              \ and to determine whether the microbiota alone could be responsible\
              \ for the observed phenotypic variation, fecal samples were collected\
              \ from SPF mice (without DSS treatment) from parental lineages that\
              \ represented extremes of disease outcome and were used to colonize\
              \ C57BL/6N germ-free mice. These colonized recipient mice were then\

              \ colon sections collected and analyzed histologically 10 days after\

              \ between disease- and non-associated lineages (P = 0.0002, paired t-test;\

              \ in mediation of phenotypic outcomes to DSS in genetically identical\
              \ mice, we next sought to understand the degree of variability in the\
              \ mouse microbiota across a single facility, and to define changes in\
              \ the microbiota that occur with DSS treatment. Fecal samples were collected\
              \ before DSS treatment and 10 days after DSS exposure, and subjected\
              \ to taxonomic profiling with 16 S ribosomal RNA amplicon sequencing\
              \ to determine microbiota community composition. Consistent with previous\
              \ reports of gastrointestinal inflammation, this analysis demonstrated\
              \ a clear separation of microbiome community between pre- and post-DSS\
              \ samples (Fig. 2b,c and Extended Data Figs. 2 and 3) and a significant\
              \ reduction in bacterial diversity (Shannon diversity index, P = 0.0357;\
              \ Fig. 2d)12. Although expansion of Proteobacteria is often associated\
              \ with gut microbiome dysbiosis, while an increase in Proteobacteria\
              \ was observed post DSS (P < 0.05, Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test), limited\
              \ association was observed between weight loss and Proteobacteria proportion\
              \ either pre (Fig. 2e; Spearman correlation, 0.196) or post DSS treatment\
              \ (Fig. 2e; Spearman correlation, \u22120.289). This suggests that other\
              \ gut bacteria may be contributing to the observed variation in DSS\
              \ resistance and susceptibility.Given the transmissibility of disease\
              \ phenotype we observed in the germ-free mouse experiments, we reasoned\
              \ that the observed phenotypic variation was primarily dependent on\
              \ baseline microbiota composition before DSS treatment. To understand\
              \ the composition of microbiota associated with increased risk of disease\
              \ outcome, we applied linear discriminant analysis to gut microbiota\
              \ composition before and after DSS exposure24. This unsupervised analysis\
              \ leveraged the variability between mouse lineage-specific bacteria\
              \ to identify the bacterial taxa that most closely predict DSS response.\
              \ Using this approach, we identified two statistically different bacterial\
              \ taxa associated with no disease, and five statistically different\
              \ bacterial taxa associated with >5% weight loss. Notably, no relationship\
              \ was observed between the occurrence or abundance of these isolates\
              \ in mice before DSS exposure, and equivalent predictive bacterial taxa\
              \ were not identified within the microbiota of mice after DSS exposure.\
              \ Our results suggest that the presence of specific gut bacterial taxa\
              \ before DSS exposure may influence disease severity and outcome, possibly\
              \ by either priming or protection from disease.Isolation of bacterial\
              \ species for functional validationWhile we show clear associations\
              \ between specific bacterial taxa and DSS-mediated disease outcome using\
              \ 16 S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing, accurate taxonomic identification\
              \ to strain level and experimental validation require the isolation\
              \ and genome sequencing of pure clonal cultures of bacterial strains.\
              \ To target and purify bacterial strains, we next performed broad-based\
              \ culture of ~2,000 bacterial colonies from mouse fecal samples. The\
              \ resulting isolates were identified by capillary 16 S rRNA gene sequencing\
              \ and included four previously identified bacterial taxa, two \u2018\
              disease associated\u2019 and two \u2018health associated\u2019. These\
              \ isolates were subjected to whole-genome sequencing and genomic analysis\
              \ to aid in precise taxonomic and phylogenetic assignment (Extended\
              \ Data Fig. 4). In addition, we performed extensive phenotypic characterization\
              \ and comparative genome analyses of these four species (Methods) as\
              \ a basis to provisionally name the health-associated bacteria Anaerostipes\
              \ faecis and Sangeribacter muris and the disease-associated bacteria\
              \ Duncaniella muricolitica and Alistipes okayasuensis; of note, the\
              \ last three species are mouse specific. Examination of the relative\
              \ abundance of each of these species before DSS treatment identified\
              \ significantly higher levels of A. faecis (P = 0264, t-test) and S.\
              \ muris (P = 0.0010, t-test) in those mice without weight loss, and\
              \ significantly higher levels of D. muricolitica (P = 0.0351, t-test)\
              \ and A. okayasuensis (P = 0.0006, t-test) in mice that experienced\
              \ >5% weight loss (Fig. 2f).We next repeated the DSS experimental model\
              \ in either germ-free mice or germ-free mice stably monocolonized for\
              \ 4 weeks with one of these four bacterial strains (Extended Data Figs.\
              \ 5a and 6). Control germ-free mice treated with DSS neither lost weight\
              \ (Fig. 3a) nor experienced mortality (Fig. 3b) over the course of the\
              \ experiment, suggesting that the presence of gut bacteria is important\
              \ in triggering overt disease in our facility. Comparable experimental\
              \ outcomes were observed in DSS-treated, germ-free mice monocolonized\
              \ with either of the health-associated bacteria, which did not lose\
              \ weight or develop intestinal pathology (Fig. 3a) nor experienced significant\
              \ mortality (Fig. 3b). In contrast, when DSS-treated mice were monocolonized\
              \ with either of the disease-associated bacteria, we observed more rapid\
              \ and greater weight loss (Fig. 3a) and significantly reduced survival\
              \ (Fig. 3b). Therefore, we identified and validated D. muricolitica\
              \ and A. okayasuensis as mouse bacteria that can promote disease not\
              \ observed in mice monocolonized with the commensal bacteria S. muris\

              \ dataTo understand inflammatory immune responses in the intestine potentially\
              \ caused by disease-associated versus health-associated species, we\
              \ next examined histology, immune cell populations and cytokine production.\
              \ The human-colonizing A. faecis and the facility-prevalent D. muricolitica\
              \ were chosen as exemplary disease- and health-associated bacteria,\
              \ respectively, for these analyses. Flow cytometric analysis of intestinal\
              \ lamina propria leukocytes isolated from germ-free mice monocolonized\
              \ for 4 weeks with either A. faecis or D. muricolitica revealed that\
              \ colonization with either strain did not significantly impact the composition\
              \ of intestinal leukocyte and lymphocyte subsets (Extended Data Figs.\
              \ 5b,c and 6). However, the perturbation and epithelial disruption induced\
              \ by DSS led to significantly increased inflammatory CD64+CD11c+ monocytes/macrophages\
              \ in the lamina propria compartment of the large intestine in D. muricolitica\
              \ monocolonized mice, but not in A. faecis monocolonized mice (Extended\
              \ Data Figs. 5c,d and 6). These monocytes have been shown to play a\
              \ pathogenic role in the intestine in the context of Helicobacter-induced\
              \ inflammation25. This suggests that, although neither pathogenic nor\
              \ immunogenic at homeostasis, D. muricolitica drives increased inflammatory\
              \ responses in the wake of epithelial damage whereas health-associated\
              \ A. faecis does not. Importantly, while histological samples taken\
              \ after 7 days of DSS treatment from colons and caeca of D. muricolitica\
              \ monocolonized mice occasionally exhibited features of severe inflammation,\
              \ this was not statistically different from that of A. faecis monocolonized\
              \ mice (Fig. 3c,d) and did not consistently correspond to the weight\
              \ loss observed. This again suggests that weight loss in the DSS model\
              \ may not always correlate with intestinal inflammation and pathology.To\
              \ determine whether the presence of D. muricolitica or A. faecis had\
              \ a positive or negative correlation with weight change, we next examined\
              \ 20 independent mice and assessed the relationship between bacterial\
              \ levels using quantitative PCR (qPCR) before DSS treatment and weight\
              \ change observed at day 10. This analysis identified a positive correlation\
              \ between weight change and pre-DSS A. faecis abundance (R = 0.3679,\
              \ P = 0.0046; Fig. 3e). Similarly, a negative correlation was observed\
              \ between weight change and D. muricolitica abundance (R2 = 0.3626,\
              \ P = 0.0050; Fig. 3e). This independent confirmation provides further\
              \ validation of the relationship between these species and the severity\
              \ of DSS colitis; however, additional work is needed to confirm their\
              \ roles as pathobionts.Global distribution and prevalence in other mouse\
              \ facilitiesBecause D. muricolitica and A. okayasuensis affected the\
              \ outcome of DSS colitis in our mouse facility, we next explored the\
              \ presence and distribution of these bacteria in other mouse facilities\
              \ around the world. To do so, we first generated a global representation\
              \ of laboratory mouse intestinal microbiomes by curating 582 publicly\
              \ available shotgun metagenome samples from \u2018control\u2019, SPF\
              \ mice. We combined this dataset with shotgun metagenomes from feces\
              \ of 40 mice at the Wellcome Sanger Institute to yield a global mouse\
              \ gut microbiome dataset covering 31 institutes across 12 countries.\
              \ We then determined the prevalence and abundance of health-associated\
              \ bacteria S. muris and A. faecis and disease-associated bacteria D.\
              \ muricolitica and A. okayasuensis in this mouse microbiome dataset.Duncaniella\
              \ muricolitica and A. okayasuensis were both dominant members of the\
              \ mouse microbiome, present in 54.5 and 47.9% of samples and with a\
              \ mean abundance of 0.52 and 0.48% reads per sample, respectively. Importantly,\
              \ D. muricolitica and A. okayasuensis were each detected in 80.6% (25/31)\
              \ of the institutes included in the analyses (Fig. 4), and there were\
              \ only three institutes that did not contain either of these species.\
              \ For comparison, among health-associated species S. muris was the most\
              \ dominant in the mouse gut microbiota, present in 96.5% of samples\
              \ with a mean abundance of 6.2% reads, while A. faecis was a relatively\
              \ minor species, present in 5.9% of samples with a mean abundance of\
              \ 0.22% reads. S. muris was present in all (31/31) of the institutes\
              \ included in the analyses, whereas A. faecis was detected in 25.8%\
              \ (8/31). The abundance of each species also differed between institutes\
              \ (Fig. 4). Thus, we show that mouse-derived bacteria cultured from\
              \ our institute are common mouse symbionts and, importantly, D. muricolitica\
              \ and A. okayasuensis are common, but not ubiquitous, in animal facilities\

              \ Cohousing, heterozygote mating and other experimental procedures have\
              \ been used in an attempt to normalize the microbiota within experiments\
              \ and ensure direct measures of the effects of mouse genetic background\
              \ on disease phenotype rather than indirect and unknown microbiota-associated\
              \ effects26. In our approach we leveraged this variability in DSS outcome,\
              \ in combination with microbiome analysis, machine learning, anerobic\
              \ culturing and germ-free mouse validation experiments, to gain relevant\
              \ biological insight into microbiota determinants of DSS disease. While\
              \ this consideration of the microbiome did not completely eliminate\
              \ the impact of multidimensionality in the DSS model, we identified\
              \ and undertook experimental validation of D. muricolitica and A. okayasuensis,\
              \ both of which have a dominant effect on DSS outcome.Interestingly,\
              \ D. muricolitica and A. okayasuensis are phylogenetically distinct\
              \ from each other and neither had computationally predicted virulence\
              \ factors within their genome. While it remains unclear how these isolates\
              \ contribute to DSS disease, both exhibit a potential for polysaccharide\
              \ utilization that may mediate this relationship through interaction\
              \ with the mucus layer. We also noted that weight loss and intestinal\
              \ pathology do not always correlate, so they should not necessarily\
              \ be used as surrogates for each other. Similarly, substantial weight\
              \ loss was observed in monocolonized mice even in the absence of severe\
              \ inflammation, suggesting that activation of key pathways alone can\
              \ have a substantial impact on experimental outcome. Together, these\
              \ insights raise the need for further experimental study of host interactions\
              \ and the biology of these important mouse-specific bacteria.We propose\
              \ that researchers should consider monitoring for D. muricolitica and\
              \ A. okayasuensis in their mouse facilities, as is undertaken for other\
              \ immunophenotyped-affecting microbes such as segmented filamentous\
              \ bacteria27. In some cases, precolonization of animals with these bacteria,\
              \ if they are not present in the facility, may yield better experimental\
              \ control and increase confidence in this important and widely used\
              \ mouse model of human disease. Overall, our work suggests that the\
              \ application of metagenomics techniques to report microbiota composition,\
              \ in addition to the genetic and disease phenotypes being described,\
              \ should represent a standard minimum requirement for the DSS mouse\
              \ model. We have deposited the D. muricolitis, A. okayasuensis, S. muris\
              \ and A. faecis strains and genomes in public repositories to support\
              \ this work.\",\"methods\":\"MethodsMouse modelsMice were maintained\

              \ quality and adapter sequences using KneadData v.0.7.3, with default\
              \ settings. Host reads were removed from samples using the GRCm39 reference\
              \ genome and Bowtie2 v.2.3.5. In addition, reads were aligned to the\
              \ Phi X 174 genome and removed. Taxonomic classification of metagenomic\
              \ reads was performed using Kraken2 v.2.0.8 and a custom database built\

              \ For shotgun metagenomic sequencing, relative abundance of species\
              \ was corrected using Bracken v.2.5.2. Bar plots for species prevalence\
              \ data and sample numbers were generated using the ggplot2 v.3.3.3 package.\
              \ To quantify and visualize intrainstitute abundance, species abundance\
              \ data for each sample underwent Bayesian multiplicative replacement\
              \ of zero counts using the zCompositions v.1.3.4 package, and the data\
              \ transformed using center log-ratio normalization. Mean abundance per\
              \ sample was then calculated and visualized using the pheatmap v.1.0.12\
              \ package. Principal component analyses were performed in R, and linear\
              \ regression analysis was performed using the linear regression function\
              \ in python scikit-learn v.0.20.4. Alpha diversity was assessed using\
              \ Vegan v.2.5.6 (ref. 30). Correlation analysis was performed using\

              \ samplesTo assess the abundance of both health- and disease-associated\
              \ bacteria in mice from different institutes, we curated publicly available\
              \ fecal shotgun metagenomes for healthy, control SPF mice from NCBI\
              \ and ENA. These samples included mice from different genetic backgrounds\
              \ and strains, but samples were excluded if mice were younger than 3\
              \ weeks, had received antimicrobial treatment or dietary intervention\
              \ or had gene knockout. In total 582 fecal shotgun metagenomes were\
              \ curated.qPCR of bacterial loadAnaerostipes faecis and D. muricolitica\
              \ were quantified in the feces of SPF mice using qPCR with custom primers.\
              \ Primers were designed using the taxon-linked gene catalog of MGBC32.\
              \ Briefly, we identified gene targets that were both unique to, and\
              \ highly conserved in, the genome of each species. To ensure target\
              \ specificity, we selected gene clusters that shared <50% sequence identity\
              \ with all nontarget species sequences. Gene targets were defined as\
              \ highly conserved if they were identified in 100% of high-quality target\
              \ species genomes in the MGBC. Furthermore, only single-copy-number\
              \ gene targets were considered. Sequences for selected gene products\
              \ were then clustered at 90% sequence identity and used as templates\
              \ for design of PCR primers with NCBI Primer-BLAST33, ensuring specificity\
              \ against the NCBI nonredundant gene catalog. Two primers for each species\
              \ were used in conjunction for qPCR.Primers: A14_1 (gene target: MGBC000029_00009),\

              \ from feces using FastDNA Spin Kit for Soil (MPBio) according to the\
              \ manufacturer\u2019s instructions, and DNA eluted into 100 \xB5l of\
              \ double-distilled H2O. Eluted DNA was then diluted 1:50 and qPCR performed\
              \ using SYBR Green chemistry (Thermo Fisher). To approximate the relative\
              \ abundance of target species in SPF feces, cycle threshold values were\
              \ normalized to those of a universal bacterial 16 S primer (F: 5'- GTGSTGCAYGGYTGTCGTCA-3';\

              \ open reading frames (ORFs) could be annotated) to functionally characterize\
              \ the strain. The strain encodes 47 genes predicted to be carbohydrate-active\
              \ enzymes (CAZymes), including 29 glycoside hydrolases: seven beta-glucosidases\
              \ (GH3, EC 3.2.1.21); five beta-galactosidases (EC 3.2.1.23); five endohydrolytic\

              \ 3.2.1.78); and an alpha-l-fucosidase (EC 3.2.1.51). Despite this predicted\
              \ hydrolytic potential, the strain shows limited capacity to utilize\
              \ disaccharides and oligosaccharides as sole carbon sources. While the\
              \ strain tested positive for utilization of alpha-d-lactose, sucrose\

              \ of l-histidine to l-glutamate via 4-Imidazolone-5-phsophate (EC 4.3.1.3,\
              \ EC 4.2.1.49, EC 3.5.2.7, EC 2.1.2.5). In support of these predictions,\
              \ the strain is capable of utilizing urocanate as a sole carbon source.\
              \ In keeping with other members of the genus Alistipes, this strain\
              \ is predicted to encode a putative tryptophanase (EC 4.1.99.1) that\
              \ would allow it to hydrolyze tryptophan to indole. The strain is also\
              \ predicted to encode a butyrate phosphotransferase (EC 2.3.1.19) and\
              \ a butyrate kinase (EC 2.7.2.7), indicating its potential to metabolize\
              \ butyrate. The genome is 2,329,524 bp with a G + C content of 56.45\
              \ mol%. We propose the name \u2018Alistipes okayasuensis\u2019 for this\
              \ previously undescribed species, in reference to the origins of the\
              \ DSS colitis model and reflecting this species\u2019 association with\

              \ 75084T).The strain is strictly anaerobic. Reconstruction of KEGG metabolic\
              \ pathways (55.4% of 3,222 predicted ORFs could be annotated) indicates\
              \ that the strain can produce butyrate via a butyrate phosphotransferase/butyrate\
              \ kinase operon (EC 2.7.2.7, EC 2.3.1.91), in keeping with the genus\
              \ type species A. caccae. Likewise, the strain is predicted to encode\
              \ an arginine dihydrolase (EC 3.5.3.6). In contrast to the genus description,\
              \ however, this strain is predicted to encode neither an alpha-galactosidase\
              \ (EC 3.2.1.22) nor a phosphoamidase (EC 3.9.1.1).The strain shows limited\
              \ capacity to utilize monosaccharides as sole carbon sources: it had\
              \ a robust phenotype for utilization of 3-methyl-d-glucose but tested\
              \ negative for its ability to utilize other monosaccharides including\
              \ d-fructose, d-galactose, d-mannose or d-glucose as sole carbon sources.\
              \ Notably, the strain is predicted to encode the complete Leloir pathway\
              \ for galactose metabolism, as well as multiple beta-galactosidases\
              \ (EC 3.2.1.23), indicating that it might lack a galactose transporter\
              \ but could metabolize galactose in different contexts such as downstream\
              \ of other pathways of carbohydrate metabolism. The strain can utilize\
              \ some disaccharides, testing positive for sucrose utilization, potentially\
              \ via multiple oligo-1,6-glucosidases (EC 3.2.1.10), d-trehalose utilization,\
              \ potentially via three trehalases (EC 3.2.1.28, GH37, GH65) and turanose\

              \ utilize alpha-d-lactose, lactulose, maltose, d-melibiose, gentiobiose,\
              \ d-cellobiose or palatinose. Additionally, the strain tested negative\

              \ d-raffinose and the tetrasaccharide stachyose\u2014potentially due\

              \ utilize beta-cyclodextrin, but tested negative for utilization of\
              \ dextrin and alpha-cyclodextrin. The strain is capable of utilizing\

        n\\nExperimental mouse models are central to basic biomedical research; however,\
        \ variability exists across genetically identical mice and mouse facilities\
        \ making comparisons difficult. Whether specific indigenous gut bacteria drive\
        \ immunophenotypic variability in mouse models of human disease remains poorly\
        \ understood. We performed a large-scale experiment using 579 genetically\
        \ identical laboratory mice from a single animal facility, designed to identify\
        \ the causes of disease variability in the widely used dextran sulphate sodium\
        \ mouse model of inflammatory bowel disease. Commonly used treatment endpoint\
        \ measures\u2014weight loss and intestinal pathology\u2014showed limited correlation\
        \ and varied across mouse lineages. Analysis of the gut microbiome, coupled\
        \ with machine learning and targeted anaerobic culturing, identified and isolated\
        \ two previously undescribed species, Duncaniella muricolitica and Alistipes\
        \ okayasuensis, and demonstrated that they exert dominant effects in the dextran\
        \ sulphate sodium model leading to variable treatment endpoint measures. We\
        \ show that the identified gut microbial species are common, but not ubiquitous,\
        \ in mouse facilities around the world, and suggest that researchers monitor\
        \ for these species to provide experimental design opportunities for improved\
        \ mouse models of human intestinal diseases.\\n\\n## Main\\n\\nExperimental\
        \ mouse models are central to basic biomedical research and serve as important\
        \ preclinical models in drug discovery for a variety of human diseases, including\
        \ autoimmune and metabolic disorders, cancers and infections. Unfortunately,\
        \ there is tremendous variability in disease penetrance and reproducibility\
        \ among genetically identical mice within and between mouse facilities, limiting\
        \ the utility of many commonly used models1\u20133. Specific-pathogen-free\
        \ (SPF) protocols have been successfully employed to control the confounding\
        \ effects that can be caused by known bacterial pathogens, but we lack equivalent\
        \ knowledge of the effects of the diverse, uncharacterized symbiotic bacteria\
        \ within the indigenous gut microbiota of mice. While our knowledge of the\
        \ human gut microbiota in health and disease has expanded extensively with\
        \ large-scale microbiome studies, comprehensive computational bacterial discovery4,5\
        \ and extensive genome-sequenced bacterial collections6\u20139, equivalent\
        \ investigations in mouse models have remained limited. The vast differences\
        \ in species type, composition and dispersal between human and mouse microbiotas\
        \ highlight the importance of efforts to culture mouse-specific bacteria and\
        \ to validate their functions during intestinal homeostasis and disease10,11.\\\
        n\\nInflammatory bowel disease (IBD) research relies heavily on laboratory\
        \ mice to understand colitis and the role of host genetics in disease resistance\
        \ and susceptibility. Detailed immune characterization shows colitis induction\
        \ with specific microbial communities12 or species colonization with Helicobacter\
        \ spp.13,14, Enterobacteriaceae15, Bilophila wadsworthia16 or segmented filamentous\
        \ bacteria17. Potential genetic modulators of IBD are routinely assessed through\
        \ administration of dextran sulphate sodium (DSS) at various concentrations\
        \ in drinking water, which acts by damaging the gut epithelial barrier to\
        \ trigger inflammatory disease12,13. In germ-free mice, immune-mediated colitis\
        \ is largely absent although reduced barrier function can introduce susceptibility\
        \ at higher DSS concentrations18. Similarly, dietary changes in both germ-free\
        \ and SPF mice can determine DSS susceptibility in a microbiome-dependent\
        \ and -independent manner19, and highly specific protection is provided by\
        \ the presence of Clostridium immunis20\u201323. Despite these advances, the\
        \ gut microbiota in these mouse models, including standard SPF models, is\
        \ rarely profiled at the genomic level or cultured in the laboratory, nor\
        \ robustly controlled to understand the contribution of general gut bacteria\
        \ to experimental outcomes.\\n\\nTo quantify the variability of the widely\
        \ used DSS model of IBD and to investigate primary factors contributing to\
        \ this variability, we undertook a large-scale experiment using 579 genetically\
        \ identical laboratory mice in a single animal facility. Incorporating standardized\
        \ phenotyping, microbiome analysis and metadata collection, this approach\
        \ was designed to identify and validate the causes of variability for standard\
        \ experimental endpoints (weight loss and intestinal pathology). Using a data-driven\
        \ approach we identified, from gut microbiome data, candidate bacterial taxa\
        \ driving weight loss and intestinal inflammation. Functional validation with\
        \ cultured isolates suggests that these specific bacterial strains can determine\
        \ experimental outcomes in gnotobiotic mice. Thus, using an experimental approach\
        \ for microbiome discovery, we identified the previously undescribed mouse\
        \ gut bacteria Duncaniella muricolitica and Alistipes okayasuensis, found\
        \ frequently in mouse colonies around the world, that impact outcomes in the\
        \ DSS model of colitis and may be acting as pathobionts.\\n\\n## Results\\\
        n\\n### Disease severity is highly variable in the DSS mouse model\\n\\nWe\
        \ administered 1.5% DSS through the drinking water for 7 days to 579 identically\
        \ housed, SPF wild-type C57BL/6N mice (297 males, 282 females; median age\
        \ 11 weeks; s.d. 12 days) from 14 distinct parental lineages (that is, founder\
        \ matings derived from a single breeding pair). We observed extensive variability\
        \ in experimental endpoints in these genetically identical mice at 10 days\
        \ post DSS treatment, with histological assessment of intestinal pathology\
        \ of the mid and distal colon ranging from severe inflammation, characterized\
        \ by extensive crypt loss, leukocytic infiltration and edema, to no visible\
        \ inflammation (Fig. 1a,b). Substantial variation was also observed in the\
        \ weight change of mice treated with DSS, with the response ranging from 12%\
        \ weight gain to 30% weight loss across the cohort (Fig. 1c). Regression analysis\
        \ considering histology scores and weight loss demonstrated limited correlation\
        \ (R2 = 0.27), suggesting that weight loss and intestinal pathology outcomes,\
        \ common experimental endpoint measures in the DSS model, may be partially\
        \ independent responses to DSS (Fig. 1d). This relationship is consistent\
        \ with systemic complications contributing to experimental endpoints in the\
        \ DSS model.Fig. 1Disease severity is highly variable in the DSS mouse model.a,\

        \ R2 = 0.273.\\n\\n### Gut microbiota is major driver of variable response\
        \ to DSS\\n\\nTo identify the primary factors determining disease outcome,\
        \ we established a random forest classifier model incorporating mouse sex,\
        \ age, lineage, parents, mouse room and experimental date to assess the relative\
        \ importance of each of these factors (Extended Data Fig. 1). The strongest\
        \ predictive factor for weight loss and histology score, both together and\
        \ independently in these genetically identical C57BL/6N mice maintained under\
        \ standardized SPF conditions within the same facility, was parental lineage,\
        \ with correlation analysis confirming these associations (P < 0.01, Kruskal\u2013\
        Wallis; Extended Data Fig. 1).\\n\\nSince all mice were derived from the same\
        \ genetic founder stock, the most likely mediator of their DSS phenotype was\
        \ an extrinsic lineage-specific factor. However, to exclude the role of host\
        \ genetics or epigenetic differences between colonies, and to determine whether\
        \ the microbiota alone could be responsible for the observed phenotypic variation,\
        \ fecal samples were collected from SPF mice (without DSS treatment) from\
        \ parental lineages that represented extremes of disease outcome and were\
        \ used to colonize C57BL/6N germ-free mice. These colonized recipient mice\
        \ were then subjected to DSS treatment involving daily weight measurements,\
        \ with colon sections collected and analyzed histologically 10 days after\
        \ the initiation of DSS treatment. Recipient mice exhibited both weight loss\
        \ and pathology scores not statistically different from those observed in\
        \ the respective donor mouse lineages, but differing significantly between\
        \ disease- and non-associated lineages (P = 0.0002, paired t-test; Fig. 2a).\
        \ From these results it is clear that, independent of other factors such as\
        \ host genetics or epigenetic lineage-specific factors, the microbiota is\
        \ sufficient to produce the observed variation in phenotypic response to DSS\

        \ \u2264 0.001).Source data\\n\\n### Discovery of bacteria that drive disease\
        \ variability\\n\\nHaving established the importance of the microbiota in\
        \ mediation of phenotypic outcomes to DSS in genetically identical mice, we\
        \ next sought to understand the degree of variability in the mouse microbiota\
        \ across a single facility, and to define changes in the microbiota that occur\
        \ with DSS treatment. Fecal samples were collected before DSS treatment and\
        \ 10 days after DSS exposure, and subjected to taxonomic profiling with 16\
        \ S ribosomal RNA amplicon sequencing to determine microbiota community composition.\
        \ Consistent with previous reports of gastrointestinal inflammation, this\
        \ analysis demonstrated a clear separation of microbiome community between\
        \ pre- and post-DSS samples (Fig. 2b,c and Extended Data Figs. 2 and 3) and\
        \ a significant reduction in bacterial diversity (Shannon diversity index,\
        \ P = 0.0357; Fig. 2d)12. Although expansion of Proteobacteria is often associated\
        \ with gut microbiome dysbiosis, while an increase in Proteobacteria was observed\
        \ post DSS (P < 0.05, Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test), limited association was\
        \ observed between weight loss and Proteobacteria proportion either pre (Fig.\
        \ 2e; Spearman correlation, 0.196) or post DSS treatment (Fig. 2e; Spearman\
        \ correlation, \u22120.289). This suggests that other gut bacteria may be\
        \ contributing to the observed variation in DSS resistance and susceptibility.\\\
        n\\nGiven the transmissibility of disease phenotype we observed in the germ-free\
        \ mouse experiments, we reasoned that the observed phenotypic variation was\
        \ primarily dependent on baseline microbiota composition before DSS treatment.\
        \ To understand the composition of microbiota associated with increased risk\
        \ of disease outcome, we applied linear discriminant analysis to gut microbiota\
        \ composition before and after DSS exposure24. This unsupervised analysis\
        \ leveraged the variability between mouse lineage-specific bacteria to identify\
        \ the bacterial taxa that most closely predict DSS response. Using this approach,\
        \ we identified two statistically different bacterial taxa associated with\
        \ no disease, and five statistically different bacterial taxa associated with\
        \ >5% weight loss. Notably, no relationship was observed between the occurrence\
        \ or abundance of these isolates in mice before DSS exposure, and equivalent\
        \ predictive bacterial taxa were not identified within the microbiota of mice\
        \ after DSS exposure. Our results suggest that the presence of specific gut\
        \ bacterial taxa before DSS exposure may influence disease severity and outcome,\
        \ possibly by either priming or protection from disease.\\n\\n### Isolation\
        \ of bacterial species for functional validation\\n\\nWhile we show clear\
        \ associations between specific bacterial taxa and DSS-mediated disease outcome\
        \ using 16 S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing, accurate taxonomic identification\
        \ to strain level and experimental validation require the isolation and genome\
        \ sequencing of pure clonal cultures of bacterial strains. To target and purify\
        \ bacterial strains, we next performed broad-based culture of ~2,000 bacterial\
        \ colonies from mouse fecal samples. The resulting isolates were identified\
        \ by capillary 16 S rRNA gene sequencing and included four previously identified\
        \ bacterial taxa, two \u2018disease associated\u2019 and two \u2018health\
        \ associated\u2019. These isolates were subjected to whole-genome sequencing\
        \ and genomic analysis to aid in precise taxonomic and phylogenetic assignment\
        \ (Extended Data Fig. 4). In addition, we performed extensive phenotypic characterization\
        \ and comparative genome analyses of these four species (Methods) as a basis\
        \ to provisionally name the health-associated bacteria Anaerostipes faecis\
        \ and Sangeribacter muris and the disease-associated bacteria Duncaniella\
        \ muricolitica and Alistipes okayasuensis; of note, the last three species\
        \ are mouse specific. Examination of the relative abundance of each of these\
        \ species before DSS treatment identified significantly higher levels of A.\
        \ faecis (P = 0264, t-test) and S. muris (P = 0.0010, t-test) in those mice\
        \ without weight loss, and significantly higher levels of D. muricolitica\
        \ (P = 0.0351, t-test) and A. okayasuensis (P = 0.0006, t-test) in mice that\
        \ experienced >5% weight loss (Fig. 2f).\\n\\nWe next repeated the DSS experimental\
        \ model in either germ-free mice or germ-free mice stably monocolonized for\
        \ 4 weeks with one of these four bacterial strains (Extended Data Figs. 5a\
        \ and 6). Control germ-free mice treated with DSS neither lost weight (Fig.\
        \ 3a) nor experienced mortality (Fig. 3b) over the course of the experiment,\
        \ suggesting that the presence of gut bacteria is important in triggering\
        \ overt disease in our facility. Comparable experimental outcomes were observed\
        \ in DSS-treated, germ-free mice monocolonized with either of the health-associated\
        \ bacteria, which did not lose weight or develop intestinal pathology (Fig.\
        \ 3a) nor experienced significant mortality (Fig. 3b). In contrast, when DSS-treated\
        \ mice were monocolonized with either of the disease-associated bacteria,\
        \ we observed more rapid and greater weight loss (Fig. 3a) and significantly\
        \ reduced survival (Fig. 3b). Therefore, we identified and validated D. muricolitica\
        \ and A. okayasuensis as mouse bacteria that can promote disease not observed\
        \ in mice monocolonized with the commensal bacteria S. muris and A. faecis.Fig.\

        \ understand inflammatory immune responses in the intestine potentially caused\
        \ by disease-associated versus health-associated species, we next examined\
        \ histology, immune cell populations and cytokine production. The human-colonizing\
        \ A. faecis and the facility-prevalent D. muricolitica were chosen as exemplary\
        \ disease- and health-associated bacteria, respectively, for these analyses.\
        \ Flow cytometric analysis of intestinal lamina propria leukocytes isolated\
        \ from germ-free mice monocolonized for 4 weeks with either A. faecis or D.\
        \ muricolitica revealed that colonization with either strain did not significantly\
        \ impact the composition of intestinal leukocyte and lymphocyte subsets (Extended\
        \ Data Figs. 5b,c and 6). However, the perturbation and epithelial disruption\
        \ induced by DSS led to significantly increased inflammatory CD64+CD11c+ monocytes/macrophages\
        \ in the lamina propria compartment of the large intestine in D. muricolitica\
        \ monocolonized mice, but not in A. faecis monocolonized mice (Extended Data\
        \ Figs. 5c,d and 6). These monocytes have been shown to play a pathogenic\
        \ role in the intestine in the context of Helicobacter-induced inflammation25.\
        \ This suggests that, although neither pathogenic nor immunogenic at homeostasis,\
        \ D. muricolitica drives increased inflammatory responses in the wake of epithelial\
        \ damage whereas health-associated A. faecis does not. Importantly, while\
        \ histological samples taken after 7 days of DSS treatment from colons and\
        \ caeca of D. muricolitica monocolonized mice occasionally exhibited features\
        \ of severe inflammation, this was not statistically different from that of\
        \ A. faecis monocolonized mice (Fig. 3c,d) and did not consistently correspond\
        \ to the weight loss observed. This again suggests that weight loss in the\
        \ DSS model may not always correlate with intestinal inflammation and pathology.\\\
        n\\nTo determine whether the presence of D. muricolitica or A. faecis had\
        \ a positive or negative correlation with weight change, we next examined\
        \ 20 independent mice and assessed the relationship between bacterial levels\
        \ using quantitative PCR (qPCR) before DSS treatment and weight change observed\
        \ at day 10. This analysis identified a positive correlation between weight\
        \ change and pre-DSS A. faecis abundance (R = 0.3679, P = 0.0046; Fig. 3e).\
        \ Similarly, a negative correlation was observed between weight change and\
        \ D. muricolitica abundance (R2 = 0.3626, P = 0.0050; Fig. 3e). This independent\
        \ confirmation provides further validation of the relationship between these\
        \ species and the severity of DSS colitis; however, additional work is needed\
        \ to confirm their roles as pathobionts.\\n\\n### Global distribution and\
        \ prevalence in other mouse facilities\\n\\nBecause D. muricolitica and A.\
        \ okayasuensis affected the outcome of DSS colitis in our mouse facility,\
        \ we next explored the presence and distribution of these bacteria in other\
        \ mouse facilities around the world. To do so, we first generated a global\
        \ representation of laboratory mouse intestinal microbiomes by curating 582\
        \ publicly available shotgun metagenome samples from \u2018control\u2019,\
        \ SPF mice. We combined this dataset with shotgun metagenomes from feces of\
        \ 40 mice at the Wellcome Sanger Institute to yield a global mouse gut microbiome\
        \ dataset covering 31 institutes across 12 countries. We then determined the\
        \ prevalence and abundance of health-associated bacteria S. muris and A. faecis\
        \ and disease-associated bacteria D. muricolitica and A. okayasuensis in this\
        \ mouse microbiome dataset.\\n\\nDuncaniella muricolitica and A. okayasuensis\
        \ were both dominant members of the mouse microbiome, present in 54.5 and\
        \ 47.9% of samples and with a mean abundance of 0.52 and 0.48% reads per sample,\
        \ respectively. Importantly, D. muricolitica and A. okayasuensis were each\
        \ detected in 80.6% (25/31) of the institutes included in the analyses (Fig.\
        \ 4), and there were only three institutes that did not contain either of\
        \ these species. For comparison, among health-associated species S. muris\
        \ was the most dominant in the mouse gut microbiota, present in 96.5% of samples\
        \ with a mean abundance of 6.2% reads, while A. faecis was a relatively minor\
        \ species, present in 5.9% of samples with a mean abundance of 0.22% reads.\
        \ S. muris was present in all (31/31) of the institutes included in the analyses,\
        \ whereas A. faecis was detected in 25.8% (8/31). The abundance of each species\
        \ also differed between institutes (Fig. 4). Thus, we show that mouse-derived\
        \ bacteria cultured from our institute are common mouse symbionts and, importantly,\
        \ D. muricolitica and A. okayasuensis are common, but not ubiquitous, in animal\
        \ facilities around the world.Fig. 4Global epidemiology and intrainstitutional\

        \ administered 1.5% DSS through the drinking water for 7 days to 579 identically\
        \ housed, SPF wild-type C57BL/6N mice (297 males, 282 females; median age\
        \ 11 weeks; s.d. 12 days) from 14 distinct parental lineages (that is, founder\
        \ matings derived from a single breeding pair). We observed extensive variability\
        \ in experimental endpoints in these genetically identical mice at 10 days\
        \ post DSS treatment, with histological assessment of intestinal pathology\
        \ of the mid and distal colon ranging from severe inflammation, characterized\
        \ by extensive crypt loss, leukocytic infiltration and edema, to no visible\
        \ inflammation (Fig. 1a,b). Substantial variation was also observed in the\
        \ weight change of mice treated with DSS, with the response ranging from 12%\
        \ weight gain to 30% weight loss across the cohort (Fig. 1c). Regression analysis\
        \ considering histology scores and weight loss demonstrated limited correlation\
        \ (R2 = 0.27), suggesting that weight loss and intestinal pathology outcomes,\
        \ common experimental endpoint measures in the DSS model, may be partially\
        \ independent responses to DSS (Fig. 1d). This relationship is consistent\
        \ with systemic complications contributing to experimental endpoints in the\

        \ to DSS\\n\\nTo identify the primary factors determining disease outcome,\
        \ we established a random forest classifier model incorporating mouse sex,\
        \ age, lineage, parents, mouse room and experimental date to assess the relative\
        \ importance of each of these factors (Extended Data Fig. 1). The strongest\
        \ predictive factor for weight loss and histology score, both together and\
        \ independently in these genetically identical C57BL/6N mice maintained under\
        \ standardized SPF conditions within the same facility, was parental lineage,\
        \ with correlation analysis confirming these associations (P < 0.01, Kruskal\u2013\
        Wallis; Extended Data Fig. 1).\\n\\nSince all mice were derived from the same\
        \ genetic founder stock, the most likely mediator of their DSS phenotype was\
        \ an extrinsic lineage-specific factor. However, to exclude the role of host\
        \ genetics or epigenetic differences between colonies, and to determine whether\
        \ the microbiota alone could be responsible for the observed phenotypic variation,\
        \ fecal samples were collected from SPF mice (without DSS treatment) from\
        \ parental lineages that represented extremes of disease outcome and were\
        \ used to colonize C57BL/6N germ-free mice. These colonized recipient mice\
        \ were then subjected to DSS treatment involving daily weight measurements,\
        \ with colon sections collected and analyzed histologically 10 days after\
        \ the initiation of DSS treatment. Recipient mice exhibited both weight loss\
        \ and pathology scores not statistically different from those observed in\
        \ the respective donor mouse lineages, but differing significantly between\
        \ disease- and non-associated lineages (P = 0.0002, paired t-test; Fig. 2a).\
        \ From these results it is clear that, independent of other factors such as\
        \ host genetics or epigenetic lineage-specific factors, the microbiota is\
        \ sufficient to produce the observed variation in phenotypic response to DSS\

        \ variability\\n\\nHaving established the importance of the microbiota in\
        \ mediation of phenotypic outcomes to DSS in genetically identical mice, we\
        \ next sought to understand the degree of variability in the mouse microbiota\
        \ across a single facility, and to define changes in the microbiota that occur\
        \ with DSS treatment. Fecal samples were collected before DSS treatment and\
        \ 10 days after DSS exposure, and subjected to taxonomic profiling with 16\
        \ S ribosomal RNA amplicon sequencing to determine microbiota community composition.\
        \ Consistent with previous reports of gastrointestinal inflammation, this\
        \ analysis demonstrated a clear separation of microbiome community between\
        \ pre- and post-DSS samples (Fig. 2b,c and Extended Data Figs. 2 and 3) and\
        \ a significant reduction in bacterial diversity (Shannon diversity index,\
        \ P = 0.0357; Fig. 2d)12. Although expansion of Proteobacteria is often associated\
        \ with gut microbiome dysbiosis, while an increase in Proteobacteria was observed\
        \ post DSS (P < 0.05, Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test), limited association was\
        \ observed between weight loss and Proteobacteria proportion either pre (Fig.\
        \ 2e; Spearman correlation, 0.196) or post DSS treatment (Fig. 2e; Spearman\
        \ correlation, \u22120.289). This suggests that other gut bacteria may be\
        \ contributing to the observed variation in DSS resistance and susceptibility.\\\
        n\\nGiven the transmissibility of disease phenotype we observed in the germ-free\
        \ mouse experiments, we reasoned that the observed phenotypic variation was\
        \ primarily dependent on baseline microbiota composition before DSS treatment.\
        \ To understand the composition of microbiota associated with increased risk\
        \ of disease outcome, we applied linear discriminant analysis to gut microbiota\
        \ composition before and after DSS exposure24. This unsupervised analysis\
        \ leveraged the variability between mouse lineage-specific bacteria to identify\
        \ the bacterial taxa that most closely predict DSS response. Using this approach,\
        \ we identified two statistically different bacterial taxa associated with\
        \ no disease, and five statistically different bacterial taxa associated with\
        \ >5% weight loss. Notably, no relationship was observed between the occurrence\
        \ or abundance of these isolates in mice before DSS exposure, and equivalent\
        \ predictive bacterial taxa were not identified within the microbiota of mice\
        \ after DSS exposure. Our results suggest that the presence of specific gut\
        \ bacterial taxa before DSS exposure may influence disease severity and outcome,\
        \ possibly by either priming or protection from disease.\\n\\n## Isolation\
        \ of bacterial species for functional validation\\n\\nWhile we show clear\
        \ associations between specific bacterial taxa and DSS-mediated disease outcome\
        \ using 16 S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing, accurate taxonomic identification\
        \ to strain level and experimental validation require the isolation and genome\
        \ sequencing of pure clonal cultures of bacterial strains. To target and purify\
        \ bacterial strains, we next performed broad-based culture of ~2,000 bacterial\
        \ colonies from mouse fecal samples. The resulting isolates were identified\
        \ by capillary 16 S rRNA gene sequencing and included four previously identified\
        \ bacterial taxa, two \u2018disease associated\u2019 and two \u2018health\
        \ associated\u2019. These isolates were subjected to whole-genome sequencing\
        \ and genomic analysis to aid in precise taxonomic and phylogenetic assignment\
        \ (Extended Data Fig. 4). In addition, we performed extensive phenotypic characterization\
        \ and comparative genome analyses of these four species (Methods) as a basis\
        \ to provisionally name the health-associated bacteria Anaerostipes faecis\
        \ and Sangeribacter muris and the disease-associated bacteria Duncaniella\
        \ muricolitica and Alistipes okayasuensis; of note, the last three species\
        \ are mouse specific. Examination of the relative abundance of each of these\
        \ species before DSS treatment identified significantly higher levels of A.\
        \ faecis (P = 0264, t-test) and S. muris (P = 0.0010, t-test) in those mice\
        \ without weight loss, and significantly higher levels of D. muricolitica\
        \ (P = 0.0351, t-test) and A. okayasuensis (P = 0.0006, t-test) in mice that\
        \ experienced >5% weight loss (Fig. 2f).\\n\\nWe next repeated the DSS experimental\
        \ model in either germ-free mice or germ-free mice stably monocolonized for\
        \ 4 weeks with one of these four bacterial strains (Extended Data Figs. 5a\
        \ and 6). Control germ-free mice treated with DSS neither lost weight (Fig.\
        \ 3a) nor experienced mortality (Fig. 3b) over the course of the experiment,\
        \ suggesting that the presence of gut bacteria is important in triggering\
        \ overt disease in our facility. Comparable experimental outcomes were observed\
        \ in DSS-treated, germ-free mice monocolonized with either of the health-associated\
        \ bacteria, which did not lose weight or develop intestinal pathology (Fig.\
        \ 3a) nor experienced significant mortality (Fig. 3b). In contrast, when DSS-treated\
        \ mice were monocolonized with either of the disease-associated bacteria,\
        \ we observed more rapid and greater weight loss (Fig. 3a) and significantly\
        \ reduced survival (Fig. 3b). Therefore, we identified and validated D. muricolitica\
        \ and A. okayasuensis as mouse bacteria that can promote disease not observed\
        \ in mice monocolonized with the commensal bacteria S. muris and A. faecis.Fig.\

        \ understand inflammatory immune responses in the intestine potentially caused\
        \ by disease-associated versus health-associated species, we next examined\
        \ histology, immune cell populations and cytokine production. The human-colonizing\
        \ A. faecis and the facility-prevalent D. muricolitica were chosen as exemplary\
        \ disease- and health-associated bacteria, respectively, for these analyses.\
        \ Flow cytometric analysis of intestinal lamina propria leukocytes isolated\
        \ from germ-free mice monocolonized for 4 weeks with either A. faecis or D.\
        \ muricolitica revealed that colonization with either strain did not significantly\
        \ impact the composition of intestinal leukocyte and lymphocyte subsets (Extended\
        \ Data Figs. 5b,c and 6). However, the perturbation and epithelial disruption\
        \ induced by DSS led to significantly increased inflammatory CD64+CD11c+ monocytes/macrophages\
        \ in the lamina propria compartment of the large intestine in D. muricolitica\
        \ monocolonized mice, but not in A. faecis monocolonized mice (Extended Data\
        \ Figs. 5c,d and 6). These monocytes have been shown to play a pathogenic\
        \ role in the intestine in the context of Helicobacter-induced inflammation25.\
        \ This suggests that, although neither pathogenic nor immunogenic at homeostasis,\
        \ D. muricolitica drives increased inflammatory responses in the wake of epithelial\
        \ damage whereas health-associated A. faecis does not. Importantly, while\
        \ histological samples taken after 7 days of DSS treatment from colons and\
        \ caeca of D. muricolitica monocolonized mice occasionally exhibited features\
        \ of severe inflammation, this was not statistically different from that of\
        \ A. faecis monocolonized mice (Fig. 3c,d) and did not consistently correspond\
        \ to the weight loss observed. This again suggests that weight loss in the\
        \ DSS model may not always correlate with intestinal inflammation and pathology.\\\
        n\\nTo determine whether the presence of D. muricolitica or A. faecis had\
        \ a positive or negative correlation with weight change, we next examined\
        \ 20 independent mice and assessed the relationship between bacterial levels\
        \ using quantitative PCR (qPCR) before DSS treatment and weight change observed\
        \ at day 10. This analysis identified a positive correlation between weight\
        \ change and pre-DSS A. faecis abundance (R = 0.3679, P = 0.0046; Fig. 3e).\
        \ Similarly, a negative correlation was observed between weight change and\
        \ D. muricolitica abundance (R2 = 0.3626, P = 0.0050; Fig. 3e). This independent\
        \ confirmation provides further validation of the relationship between these\
        \ species and the severity of DSS colitis; however, additional work is needed\
        \ to confirm their roles as pathobionts.\\n\\n## Global distribution and prevalence\
        \ in other mouse facilities\\n\\nBecause D. muricolitica and A. okayasuensis\
        \ affected the outcome of DSS colitis in our mouse facility, we next explored\
        \ the presence and distribution of these bacteria in other mouse facilities\
        \ around the world. To do so, we first generated a global representation of\
        \ laboratory mouse intestinal microbiomes by curating 582 publicly available\
        \ shotgun metagenome samples from \u2018control\u2019, SPF mice. We combined\
        \ this dataset with shotgun metagenomes from feces of 40 mice at the Wellcome\
        \ Sanger Institute to yield a global mouse gut microbiome dataset covering\
        \ 31 institutes across 12 countries. We then determined the prevalence and\
        \ abundance of health-associated bacteria S. muris and A. faecis and disease-associated\
        \ bacteria D. muricolitica and A. okayasuensis in this mouse microbiome dataset.\\\
        n\\nDuncaniella muricolitica and A. okayasuensis were both dominant members\
        \ of the mouse microbiome, present in 54.5 and 47.9% of samples and with a\
        \ mean abundance of 0.52 and 0.48% reads per sample, respectively. Importantly,\
        \ D. muricolitica and A. okayasuensis were each detected in 80.6% (25/31)\
        \ of the institutes included in the analyses (Fig. 4), and there were only\
        \ three institutes that did not contain either of these species. For comparison,\
        \ among health-associated species S. muris was the most dominant in the mouse\
        \ gut microbiota, present in 96.5% of samples with a mean abundance of 6.2%\
        \ reads, while A. faecis was a relatively minor species, present in 5.9% of\
        \ samples with a mean abundance of 0.22% reads. S. muris was present in all\
        \ (31/31) of the institutes included in the analyses, whereas A. faecis was\
        \ detected in 25.8% (8/31). The abundance of each species also differed between\
        \ institutes (Fig. 4). Thus, we show that mouse-derived bacteria cultured\
        \ from our institute are common mouse symbionts and, importantly, D. muricolitica\
        \ and A. okayasuensis are common, but not ubiquitous, in animal facilities\
        \ around the world.Fig. 4Global epidemiology and intrainstitutional variation\

        n\\nDespite experimental variability in the DSS mouse model, which limits\
        \ the interpretation and translation of data, the model is increasingly used\
        \ in basic research (>6,000 DSS model publications on PubMed) and by the pharmaceutical\
        \ and biotechnology industries. Cohousing, heterozygote mating and other experimental\
        \ procedures have been used in an attempt to normalize the microbiota within\
        \ experiments and ensure direct measures of the effects of mouse genetic background\
        \ on disease phenotype rather than indirect and unknown microbiota-associated\
        \ effects26. In our approach we leveraged this variability in DSS outcome,\
        \ in combination with microbiome analysis, machine learning, anerobic culturing\
        \ and germ-free mouse validation experiments, to gain relevant biological\
        \ insight into microbiota determinants of DSS disease. While this consideration\
        \ of the microbiome did not completely eliminate the impact of multidimensionality\
        \ in the DSS model, we identified and undertook experimental validation of\
        \ D. muricolitica and A. okayasuensis, both of which have a dominant effect\
        \ on DSS outcome.\\n\\nInterestingly, D. muricolitica and A. okayasuensis\
        \ are phylogenetically distinct from each other and neither had computationally\
        \ predicted virulence factors within their genome. While it remains unclear\
        \ how these isolates contribute to DSS disease, both exhibit a potential for\
        \ polysaccharide utilization that may mediate this relationship through interaction\
        \ with the mucus layer. We also noted that weight loss and intestinal pathology\
        \ do not always correlate, so they should not necessarily be used as surrogates\
        \ for each other. Similarly, substantial weight loss was observed in monocolonized\
        \ mice even in the absence of severe inflammation, suggesting that activation\
        \ of key pathways alone can have a substantial impact on experimental outcome.\
        \ Together, these insights raise the need for further experimental study of\
        \ host interactions and the biology of these important mouse-specific bacteria.\\\
        n\\nWe propose that researchers should consider monitoring for D. muricolitica\
        \ and A. okayasuensis in their mouse facilities, as is undertaken for other\
        \ immunophenotyped-affecting microbes such as segmented filamentous bacteria27.\
        \ In some cases, precolonization of animals with these bacteria, if they are\
        \ not present in the facility, may yield better experimental control and increase\
        \ confidence in this important and widely used mouse model of human disease.\
        \ Overall, our work suggests that the application of metagenomics techniques\
        \ to report microbiota composition, in addition to the genetic and disease\
        \ phenotypes being described, should represent a standard minimum requirement\
        \ for the DSS mouse model. We have deposited the D. muricolitis, A. okayasuensis,\
        \ S. muris and A. faecis strains and genomes in public repositories to support\
        \ this work.\\n\\n## Methods\\n\\n### Mouse models\\n\\nMice were maintained\
        \ under either germ-free or SPF conditions at the Wellcome Sanger Institute\
        \ Home Office-approved facility, with all procedures carried out in accordance\
        \ with the United Kingdom Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act of 1986 under\
        \ Home Office approval (PPL no. 80/2643). Germ-free mice were maintained in\
        \ positive-pressure isolators (Bell), with feces tested by culture, microscopy\
        \ and PCR to ensure sterility. Consumables were autoclaved at 121 \xB0C for\
        \ 15 min before introduction into the isolators. For experimentation, cages\
        \ were opened in a vaporized hydrogen peroxide-sterilized, class II cabinet\
        \ (Bioquell), with fecal transplant and monocolonized gnotobiotic lines generated\
        \ by weekly oral gavage over a 3-week period. Materials were prepared in Dulbecco\u2019\
        s PBS at 100 mg ml\u20131 immediately before administration under anaerobic\
        \ conditions (10% H, 10% CO2, 80% N) in a Whitley DG250 workstation at 37\
        \ \xB0C (ref. 8). Mice were maintained in sterile ISOcages (Tecniplast) and\
        \ housed on ISOrack for the period of the experiment.\\n\\n### DSS colitis\
        \ challenge\\n\\nDextran sulphate sodium was administered at a concentration\
        \ of 1.5% (w/v) (Affymetrix, Inc., average molecular weight 44 kDa) in drinking\
        \ water for 7 days, followed by 3 days with regular drinking water, to C57BL6/6N\
        \ mice aged 7\u201316 weeks (297 male, 282 female; median age 11 weeks; s.d.\
        \ 12 days). Mice were weighed every day and culled if weight loss reached\
        \ 20% of starting weight. Average weight loss curves were censored for each\
        \ group when the first member of the group reached this endpoint, to avoid\
        \ misleading calculations of the average using the remaining members. No statistical\
        \ methods were used to predetermine sample sizes in these experiments.\\n\\\
        n### Histological assessment of intestinal inflammation\\n\\nDextran sulphate\
        \ sodium-treated SPF mice were sacrificed at day 10 by cervical dislocation,\
        \ and samples from mid and distal colon taken. Tissue sections were fixed\
        \ in buffered 10% formalin, paraffin embedded, cut and stained with hematoxylin\
        \ and eosin (H&E). Colon histopathology was blind-graded semiquantitatively,\
        \ on a scale from zero to three, for four criteria: (1) degree of epithelial\
        \ hyperplasia/damage and goblet cell depletion; (2) leukocyte infiltration\
        \ in lamina propria; (3) area of tissue affected; and (4) presence of markers\
        \ of severe inflammation, including crypt abscesses, submucosal inflammation\
        \ and edema. Scores for individual criteria were added for an overall inflammation\
        \ score of between zero and 12 for each sample. Scores from mid and distal\
        \ colon were then averaged to obtain inflammation scores for each mouse colon.\\\
        n\\nMonocolonized, germ-free mice were euthanized 7 days after DSS administration\
        \ and samples taken from the cecum and midcolon. Tissue sections were fixed\
        \ in methacarn, paraffin embedded, sectioned and stained with H&E. Colon and\
        \ cecum histopathology was graded on a semiquantitative scale by a pathologist\
        \ blinded to the groups. The criteria scored were (1) degree of epithelial\
        \ hyperplasia/damage and goblet cell depletion; (2) severity of leukocyte\
        \ infiltration in lamina propria; (3) extent of inflammation; and (4) presence\
        \ of markers of severe inflammation, including crypt abscesses, submucosal\
        \ inflammation and edema. Each criterion was scored on a scale of zero to\
        \ three based on previously described thresholds28 and the sum of the individual\
        \ scores was recorded as an indication of overall inflammation. For all animal\
        \ experiments, treatments were randomized by cage by researchers blinded to\
        \ treatment conditions. For statistical analysis, distribution was assumed\
        \ to be normal but this was not formally tested\\n\\n### Bacterial culture\\\
        n\\nFecal samples and bacterial isolates were cultured for anaerobic gastrointestinal\
        \ bacteria under anaerobic conditions (10% H, 10% CO2, 80% N) in a Whitley\
        \ DG250 workstation at 37 \xB0C (ref. 8). Fecal samples were homogenized in\
        \ reduced PBS (0.1 g ml\u20131 PBS), serially diluted and plated directly\
        \ onto YCFA agar supplemented with 0.002 g ml\u22121 each of glucose, maltose\
        \ and cellobiose. Colonies were picked, restreaked to purity and identified\
        \ using 16 S rRNA gene sequencing.\\n\\n### Microbiota profiling and analysis\\\
        n\\nFecal samples were collected directly from mice and immediately stored\
        \ at \u221280 \xB0C until DNA extraction. DNA was extracted from samples using\
        \ the FastDNA Spin Kit for Soil (MPBio) and stored at \u221220 \xB0C until\
        \ metagenomic sequencing. DNA samples were quantified using a Qubit 4 Fluorometer\
        \ (Thermo Fisher). 16 S rRNA amplicon-based profiling was performed using\
        \ the FastDNA Spin Kit for Soil (MP Biomedicals) on 300 mg of fecal sample\
        \ from each mouse. The V1\u2013V2 region of 16 S rRNA genes was amplified\
        \ with a Q5 High-Fidelity Polymerase Kit (New England Biolabs): F': AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACAC-TATGGTAATT-CC-AGMGTTYGATYMTGGCTCAG;\
        \ R': CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGATACGAGACTGATTAGTCAGTCAGAAGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAG. Each\
        \ PCR amplification was performed as four independent amplifications and pooled\
        \ in equimolar amounts for 150-base-paired (bp)-end sequencing with the Illumina\
        \ MiSeq platform. For shotgun metagenomic sequencing, samples with >100 ng\
        \ of DNA material were processed onward to paired-end (2 \xD7 150 bp) metagenomics\
        \ sequencing on the HiSeq 4000 platform as per standard manufacturer library\
        \ preparation and sequencing protocols.\\n\\n### Metagenomic data analysis\\\
        n\\nAnalysis of 16 S rRNA amplicon sequences was performed with mothur MiSeq\
        \ SOP v.1.42.3 using SILVA v.132 (ref. 29). The 16 S rRNA gene alignments\
        \ were used to determine maximum likelihood phylogeny using FastTree v.2.1.10\
        \ (ref. 30). Phylogenetic trees were visualized and edited using iTOL31. Shotgun\
        \ metagenomic reads were filtered for quality and adapter sequences using\
        \ KneadData v.0.7.3, with default settings. Host reads were removed from samples\
        \ using the GRCm39 reference genome and Bowtie2 v.2.3.5. In addition, reads\
        \ were aligned to the Phi X 174 genome and removed. Taxonomic classification\
        \ of metagenomic reads was performed using Kraken2 v.2.0.8 and a custom database\
        \ built from the genomes of the Mouse Gut Bacterial Catalog (MGBC).\\n\\nAll\
        \ data analyses were performed in R v.4.0.2. Species abundant at \u22650.01%\
        \ reads were considered present in a sample, and operational taxonomic units\
        \ (OTUs) were considered statistically different at P < 0.05. For shotgun\
        \ metagenomic sequencing, relative abundance of species was corrected using\
        \ Bracken v.2.5.2. Bar plots for species prevalence data and sample numbers\
        \ were generated using the ggplot2 v.3.3.3 package. To quantify and visualize\
        \ intrainstitute abundance, species abundance data for each sample underwent\
        \ Bayesian multiplicative replacement of zero counts using the zCompositions\
        \ v.1.3.4 package, and the data transformed using center log-ratio normalization.\
        \ Mean abundance per sample was then calculated and visualized using the pheatmap\
        \ v.1.0.12 package. Principal component analyses were performed in R, and\
        \ linear regression analysis was performed using the linear regression function\
        \ in python scikit-learn v.0.20.4. Alpha diversity was assessed using Vegan\
        \ v.2.5.6 (ref. 30). Correlation analysis was performed using Spearman\u2019\
        s rank correlation coefficient.\\n\\n### Curation of public metagenome samples\\\
        n\\nTo assess the abundance of both health- and disease-associated bacteria\
        \ in mice from different institutes, we curated publicly available fecal shotgun\
        \ metagenomes for healthy, control SPF mice from NCBI and ENA. These samples\
        \ included mice from different genetic backgrounds and strains, but samples\
        \ were excluded if mice were younger than 3 weeks, had received antimicrobial\
        \ treatment or dietary intervention or had gene knockout. In total 582 fecal\
        \ shotgun metagenomes were curated.\\n\\n### qPCR of bacterial load\\n\\nAnaerostipes\
        \ faecis and D. muricolitica were quantified in the feces of SPF mice using\
        \ qPCR with custom primers. Primers were designed using the taxon-linked gene\
        \ catalog of MGBC32. Briefly, we identified gene targets that were both unique\
        \ to, and highly conserved in, the genome of each species. To ensure target\
        \ specificity, we selected gene clusters that shared <50% sequence identity\
        \ with all nontarget species sequences. Gene targets were defined as highly\
        \ conserved if they were identified in 100% of high-quality target species\
        \ genomes in the MGBC. Furthermore, only single-copy-number gene targets were\
        \ considered. Sequences for selected gene products were then clustered at\
        \ 90% sequence identity and used as templates for design of PCR primers with\
        \ NCBI Primer-BLAST33, ensuring specificity against the NCBI nonredundant\
        \ gene catalog. Two primers for each species were used in conjunction for\
        \ qPCR.\\n\\nPrimers: A14_1 (gene target: MGBC000029_00009), forward 5'-AGCTGTTCAGGTGTCTGATCTT-3',\

        \ Kit for Soil (MPBio) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions,\
        \ and DNA eluted into 100 \xB5l of double-distilled H2O. Eluted DNA was then\
        \ diluted 1:50 and qPCR performed using SYBR Green chemistry (Thermo Fisher).\
        \ To approximate the relative abundance of target species in SPF feces, cycle\
        \ threshold values were normalized to those of a universal bacterial 16 S\
        \ primer (F: 5'- GTGSTGCAYGGYTGTCGTCA-3'; R: 5'- ACGTCRTCCMCACCTTCCTC-3').\\\
        n\\n### Intestinal immune cell isolation\\n\\nLarge intestines were excised\
        \ and separated from mesentery and fat. Transluminal sections were taken from\
        \ the cecum and distal colon for histology. The intestines were opened longitudinally,\
        \ cleared of feces then washed three times in cold PBS. To isolate intraepithelial\
        \ immune populations, the large intestines were cut into 1-cm pieces, washed\
        \ in cold PBS then incubated in 10 ml of PBS + 1 mM dithiothreitol for 10\
        \ min. Tissues were manually disrupted via shaking and then strained, with\
        \ supernatant then collected. Tissues were incubated in 10 ml of PBS + 30\
        \ mM EDTA + 10 ml of HEPES at 37 \xB0C and 200 r.p.m., before being shaken\
        \ and strained. The supernatants from these two steps were pooled, filtered\
        \ at 70 \xB5m and the filtrate fractionated using a discontinuous Percoll\
        \ gradient (80/40%). Epithelial cells were isolated from the surface of the\
        \ Percoll, and intraepithelial immune cells isolated from the interface.\\\
        n\\nTo access the lamina propria compartment, tissues were manually chopped\
        \ and digested in HBSS + 25 mM HEPES + 1 mM sodium pyruvate containing 0.05\
        \ mg ml\u20131 Collagenase VIII (Sigma) and 50 \xB5g ml\u20131 DNase I (Sigma)\
        \ for 1 h at 37 \xB0C and 80 r.p.m. Samples were mechanically disrupted and\

        \ names been validly published according to the International Code of Nomenclature\

        \ to as previously undescribed in this manuscript. Phenotypic data for the\
        \ capacity of each species to utilize 95 substrates as sole carbon sources\
        \ were attained using the BioLog platform (see BioLog analysis for a description\
        \ of methodology). Isolated genomes were functionally annotated using eggNOG-mapper\
        \ v.2 and InterProScan v.5. We describe these species and propose new names\
        \ below.\\n\\n#### Description of \u2018Alistipes okayasuensis\u2019 sp. nov\\\
        n\\nAlistipes okayasuensis (o\u2019ka.ya.su.en.sis. N.L. masc./fem. adj. okayasuensis)\
        \ is named after Isao Okayasu, who first described DSS colitis as a model\
        \ for ulcerative colitis in mice. Phylogenomic analyses place strain A61T\
        \ in the Alistipes cluster. The digital DNA\u2013DNA hybridization (dDDH)\
        \ value between A. onderdonkii and A. putredinis is 24.4%, while dDDH values\
        \ between strain A61T, A. onderdonkii and A. putredinis are 25.2 and 21.4%,\
        \ respectively. The G + C content difference between the genome of strain\
        \ A61T and A. onderdonkii, its closest phylogenomic neighbor, is 1.39%, while\
        \ their 16S rRNA gene sequence identity is 96.03%. These analyses strongly\
        \ indicate that \u2018Alistipes okayasuensis\u2019 is a separate species within\
        \ the genus Alistipes.\\n\\nThis strain is a strict anaerobe. Carbon source\
        \ utilization analysis was combined with reconstruction of Kyoto Encyclopedia\
        \ of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) metabolic pathways (55.58% of 2,022 predicted\
        \ open reading frames (ORFs) could be annotated) to functionally characterize\
        \ the strain. The strain encodes 47 genes predicted to be carbohydrate-active\
        \ enzymes (CAZymes), including 29 glycoside hydrolases: seven beta-glucosidases\
        \ (GH3, EC 3.2.1.21); five beta-galactosidases (EC 3.2.1.23); five endohydrolytic\
        \ alpha-glucosidases (GH13), including four alpha-amylases (EC 3.2.1.1); three\
        \ exohydrolytic alpha-glucosidases (GH31, EC 3.2.1.20); three cellulases (EC\
        \ 3.2.1.4); three mannan endo-1,4-beta-mannosidases (EC 3.2.1.78); and an\
        \ alpha-l-fucosidase (EC 3.2.1.51). Despite this predicted hydrolytic potential,\
        \ the strain shows limited capacity to utilize disaccharides and oligosaccharides\
        \ as sole carbon sources. While the strain tested positive for utilization\
        \ of alpha-d-lactose, sucrose and maltotriose, it tested negative for utilization\
        \ of d-cellobiose, dextrin, cyclodextrin, gentiobiose, lactulose, maltose,\
        \ d-melezitose, d-melibiose, palatinose, d-raffinose, stachyose, d-trehalose,\
        \ fucose or turanose.\\n\\nThe strain is predicted to encode enzymes for metabolism\
        \ of l-histidine to l-glutamate via 4-Imidazolone-5-phsophate (EC 4.3.1.3,\
        \ EC 4.2.1.49, EC 3.5.2.7, EC 2.1.2.5). In support of these predictions, the\
        \ strain is capable of utilizing urocanate as a sole carbon source. In keeping\
        \ with other members of the genus Alistipes, this strain is predicted to encode\
        \ a putative tryptophanase (EC 4.1.99.1) that would allow it to hydrolyze\
        \ tryptophan to indole. The strain is also predicted to encode a butyrate\
        \ phosphotransferase (EC 2.3.1.19) and a butyrate kinase (EC 2.7.2.7), indicating\
        \ its potential to metabolize butyrate. The genome is 2,329,524 bp with a\
        \ G + C content of 56.45 mol%. We propose the name \u2018Alistipes okayasuensis\u2019\
        \ for this previously undescribed species, in reference to the origins of\
        \ the DSS colitis model and reflecting this species\u2019 association with\
        \ poor outcomes of this disease model. The type strain is A61T (=CCUG 75087T\
        \ =SM 112987T).\\n\\n#### Description of \u2018Anaerostipes faecis\u2019 sp.\
        \ nov\\n\\nAnaerostipes faecis (fae\u2019cis. L. gen. fem. n. faecis, of feces,\
        \ referring to fecal origin). The closest phylogenomic neighbor of strain\
        \ A14T is Anaerostipes caccae, with a dDDH value of 48.40%. The pairwise 16\
        \ S rRNA gene sequence identity of A14T and A. caccae DSM 14662T is 98.16%.\
        \ These analyses indicate that A14T is a separate species within the genus\
        \ Anaerostipes. The genome is 3,200,246 bp with a G + C content of 43.77 mol%.\
        \ We propose the name \u2018Anaerostipes faecis\u2019 for this new species.\
        \ The type strain is A14T (=CCUG 75084T).\\n\\nThe strain is strictly anaerobic.\
        \ Reconstruction of KEGG metabolic pathways (55.4% of 3,222 predicted ORFs\
        \ could be annotated) indicates that the strain can produce butyrate via a\
        \ butyrate phosphotransferase/butyrate kinase operon (EC 2.7.2.7, EC 2.3.1.91),\
        \ in keeping with the genus type species A. caccae. Likewise, the strain is\
        \ predicted to encode an arginine dihydrolase (EC 3.5.3.6). In contrast to\
        \ the genus description, however, this strain is predicted to encode neither\
        \ an alpha-galactosidase (EC 3.2.1.22) nor a phosphoamidase (EC 3.9.1.1).\\\
        n\\nThe strain shows limited capacity to utilize monosaccharides as sole carbon\
        \ sources: it had a robust phenotype for utilization of 3-methyl-d-glucose\
        \ but tested negative for its ability to utilize other monosaccharides including\
        \ d-fructose, d-galactose, d-mannose or d-glucose as sole carbon sources.\
        \ Notably, the strain is predicted to encode the complete Leloir pathway for\
        \ galactose metabolism, as well as multiple beta-galactosidases (EC 3.2.1.23),\
        \ indicating that it might lack a galactose transporter but could metabolize\
        \ galactose in different contexts such as downstream of other pathways of\
        \ carbohydrate metabolism. The strain can utilize some disaccharides, testing\
        \ positive for sucrose utilization, potentially via multiple oligo-1,6-glucosidases\
        \ (EC 3.2.1.10), d-trehalose utilization, potentially via three trehalases\
        \ (EC 3.2.1.28, GH37, GH65) and turanose utilization. However, the strain\
        \ tested negative for its ability to utilize alpha-d-lactose, lactulose, maltose,\
        \ d-melibiose, gentiobiose, d-cellobiose or palatinose. Additionally, the\
        \ strain tested negative for utilization of the trisccharides maltotriose,\
        \ d-melezitose and d-raffinose and the tetrasaccharide stachyose\u2014potentially\
        \ due to the absence of a predicted alpha-galactosidase. The strain could\
        \ utilize beta-cyclodextrin, but tested negative for utilization of dextrin\
        \ and alpha-cyclodextrin. The strain is capable of utilizing alpha-ketovaleric\
        \ acid and d-malic acid, as well as certain amino acids and derivatives including\
        \ l-threonine, l-asparagine, l-serine and the dipeptides glycyl-l-proline\
        \ and l-alanyl-l-threonine. The strain tested negative for utilization of\
        \ l-glutamine, l-glutamate, l-valine and l-alanine.\\n\\n#### Description\
        \ of \u2018Duncaniella muricolitica\u2019 sp. nov\\n\\nDuncaniella muricolitica\
        \ (mu.ri.co\u2019li.ti.ca. L. gen. n. muris, of the mouse; Gr. n. kolon, colon;\
        \ Gr. suff. -tikos -\xEA -on, suffix used with the sense of pertaining to;\
        \ N.L. fem. adj. muricolitica, pertaining to the colon of the mouse). The\
        \ closest phylogenetic neighbor, according to pairwise 16 S rRNA gene analyses,\
        \ is Duncaniella dubosii with a sequence identity of 94.04%. The 16 S gene\
        \ sequence identity values between D. dubosii H5T and other species of the\
        \ genus, D. muris DSM 103720T and D. freteri TLL-A3T, are 95.14 and 93.00%,\
        \ respectively, indicating that A60T is a separate species within the Duncaniella\
        \ cluster. The dDDH value between A60T and D. dubosii H5T is 28.10%, confirming\
        \ a separate species status.\\n\\nRecent work benchmarking an average nucleotide\
        \ identity1 approach to define genus boundaries found that the genus inflection\
        \ points of members of the order Bacteroidales had relatively low values for\
        \ alignment fraction (AF) and ANI (AF/ANI: Bacteroides fragilis, 0.215/71.23;\
        \ Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, 0.105/68.12; Prevotella melaninogenica, 0.195/72.07).\
        \ The corresponding values between A60T and the genus type species D. muris\
        \ are 0.243/80.85, providing further evidence that A60T belongs to the genus\
        \ Duncaniella.\\n\\nThe strain is an obligate anaerobe. Reconstruction of\
        \ KEGG metabolic pathways (47.2% of 3,461 predicted ORFs could be annotated)\
        \ indicated that strain is enriched for enzymes with glycoside hydrolase activity,\
        \ encoding 47 in total. The strain is able to utilize dextrin, beta-cyclodextrin\
        \ and multiple oligosaccharides including d-melezitose, maltotriose, amygdalin,\
        \ maltose, gentiobiose (EC: 3.2.1.21), turanose and d-cellobiose (EC: 2.4.1.20;\
        \ EC: 3.2.1.21). The strain is capable of utilizing d-raffinose, and is predicted\
        \ from its genome to produce sucrose as an intermediate (EC: 3.2.1.22, EC:\
        \ 3.2.1.20) rather than stachyose or melibiose. Additionally, the strain tested\
        \ negative for utilization of both stachyose and melibiose. In our study the\
        \ strain tested negative for an ability to utilize lactose as a single carbon\
        \ source, even though it encodes seven predicted beta-galactosidases (EC 3.2.1.23).\
        \ The strain is predicted to encode 36 glycosyltransferase enzymes, among\
        \ which are seven GT2 family enzymes including two dolichyl-phosphate beta-d-mannosyltransferases\
        \ (EC: 2.4.1.82).\\n\\nThe strain can utilize a variety of monosaccharides\
        \ as single carbon sources, including alpha-d-glucose, alpha-d-glucose 1-phosphate,\
        \ 3-methyl-d-glucose, d-galactose, alpha-methyl-d-galactose, d-mannose, adonitol,\
        \ arabinose, d-gluconate, d-arabitol and d-sorbitol. It tested negative for\
        \ an ability to utilize fucose, alpha-d-lactose, d-fructose, lactate, lactulose,\
        \ d-trehalose or l-rhamnose as sole carbon sources. The strain is predicted\
        \ to encode the pathway for metabolism of l-histidine to l-glutamate via 4-Imidazolone-5-phsophate\
        \ (EC 4.3.1.3, EC 4.2.1.49, EC 3.5.2.7, EC 2.1.2.5), and tested positive for\
        \ utilization of urocanate. The genome is 4,055,027 bp with a G + C content\
        \ of 50.9 mol%. Following functional and genomic characterization of our isolate,\
        \ we propose the name \u2018Duncaniella muricolitica\u2019 for this species\
        \ in reference to its association with poor prognosis in the murine DSS model\
        \ of colitis. The type strain is A60T (=CCUG 75086T =DSM 112986T).\\n\\n####\

        \ on a scale from zero to three, for four criteria: (1) degree of epithelial\
        \ hyperplasia/damage and goblet cell depletion; (2) leukocyte infiltration\
        \ in lamina propria; (3) area of tissue affected; and (4) presence of markers\
        \ of severe inflammation, including crypt abscesses, submucosal inflammation\
        \ and edema. Scores for individual criteria were added for an overall inflammation\
        \ score of between zero and 12 for each sample. Scores from mid and distal\
        \ colon were then averaged to obtain inflammation scores for each mouse colon.\\\
        n\\nMonocolonized, germ-free mice were euthanized 7 days after DSS administration\
        \ and samples taken from the cecum and midcolon. Tissue sections were fixed\
        \ in methacarn, paraffin embedded, sectioned and stained with H&E. Colon and\
        \ cecum histopathology was graded on a semiquantitative scale by a pathologist\
        \ blinded to the groups. The criteria scored were (1) degree of epithelial\
        \ hyperplasia/damage and goblet cell depletion; (2) severity of leukocyte\
        \ infiltration in lamina propria; (3) extent of inflammation; and (4) presence\
        \ of markers of severe inflammation, including crypt abscesses, submucosal\
        \ inflammation and edema. Each criterion was scored on a scale of zero to\
        \ three based on previously described thresholds28 and the sum of the individual\
        \ scores was recorded as an indication of overall inflammation. For all animal\
        \ experiments, treatments were randomized by cage by researchers blinded to\
        \ treatment conditions. For statistical analysis, distribution was assumed\
        \ to be normal but this was not formally tested\\n\\n## Bacterial culture\\\
        n\\nFecal samples and bacterial isolates were cultured for anaerobic gastrointestinal\
        \ bacteria under anaerobic conditions (10% H, 10% CO2, 80% N) in a Whitley\
        \ DG250 workstation at 37 \xB0C (ref. 8). Fecal samples were homogenized in\
        \ reduced PBS (0.1 g ml\u20131 PBS), serially diluted and plated directly\
        \ onto YCFA agar supplemented with 0.002 g ml\u22121 each of glucose, maltose\
        \ and cellobiose. Colonies were picked, restreaked to purity and identified\
        \ using 16 S rRNA gene sequencing.\\n\\n## Microbiota profiling and analysis\\\
        n\\nFecal samples were collected directly from mice and immediately stored\
        \ at \u221280 \xB0C until DNA extraction. DNA was extracted from samples using\
        \ the FastDNA Spin Kit for Soil (MPBio) and stored at \u221220 \xB0C until\
        \ metagenomic sequencing. DNA samples were quantified using a Qubit 4 Fluorometer\
        \ (Thermo Fisher). 16 S rRNA amplicon-based profiling was performed using\
        \ the FastDNA Spin Kit for Soil (MP Biomedicals) on 300 mg of fecal sample\
        \ from each mouse. The V1\u2013V2 region of 16 S rRNA genes was amplified\
        \ with a Q5 High-Fidelity Polymerase Kit (New England Biolabs): F': AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACAC-TATGGTAATT-CC-AGMGTTYGATYMTGGCTCAG;\
        \ R': CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGATACGAGACTGATTAGTCAGTCAGAAGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAG. Each\
        \ PCR amplification was performed as four independent amplifications and pooled\
        \ in equimolar amounts for 150-base-paired (bp)-end sequencing with the Illumina\
        \ MiSeq platform. For shotgun metagenomic sequencing, samples with >100 ng\
        \ of DNA material were processed onward to paired-end (2 \xD7 150 bp) metagenomics\
        \ sequencing on the HiSeq 4000 platform as per standard manufacturer library\
        \ preparation and sequencing protocols.\\n\\n## Metagenomic data analysis\\\
        n\\nAnalysis of 16 S rRNA amplicon sequences was performed with mothur MiSeq\
        \ SOP v.1.42.3 using SILVA v.132 (ref. 29). The 16 S rRNA gene alignments\
        \ were used to determine maximum likelihood phylogeny using FastTree v.2.1.10\
        \ (ref. 30). Phylogenetic trees were visualized and edited using iTOL31. Shotgun\
        \ metagenomic reads were filtered for quality and adapter sequences using\
        \ KneadData v.0.7.3, with default settings. Host reads were removed from samples\
        \ using the GRCm39 reference genome and Bowtie2 v.2.3.5. In addition, reads\
        \ were aligned to the Phi X 174 genome and removed. Taxonomic classification\
        \ of metagenomic reads was performed using Kraken2 v.2.0.8 and a custom database\
        \ built from the genomes of the Mouse Gut Bacterial Catalog (MGBC).\\n\\nAll\
        \ data analyses were performed in R v.4.0.2. Species abundant at \u22650.01%\
        \ reads were considered present in a sample, and operational taxonomic units\
        \ (OTUs) were considered statistically different at P < 0.05. For shotgun\
        \ metagenomic sequencing, relative abundance of species was corrected using\
        \ Bracken v.2.5.2. Bar plots for species prevalence data and sample numbers\
        \ were generated using the ggplot2 v.3.3.3 package. To quantify and visualize\
        \ intrainstitute abundance, species abundance data for each sample underwent\
        \ Bayesian multiplicative replacement of zero counts using the zCompositions\
        \ v.1.3.4 package, and the data transformed using center log-ratio normalization.\
        \ Mean abundance per sample was then calculated and visualized using the pheatmap\
        \ v.1.0.12 package. Principal component analyses were performed in R, and\
        \ linear regression analysis was performed using the linear regression function\
        \ in python scikit-learn v.0.20.4. Alpha diversity was assessed using Vegan\
        \ v.2.5.6 (ref. 30). Correlation analysis was performed using Spearman\u2019\
        s rank correlation coefficient.\\n\\n## Curation of public metagenome samples\\\
        n\\nTo assess the abundance of both health- and disease-associated bacteria\
        \ in mice from different institutes, we curated publicly available fecal shotgun\
        \ metagenomes for healthy, control SPF mice from NCBI and ENA. These samples\
        \ included mice from different genetic backgrounds and strains, but samples\
        \ were excluded if mice were younger than 3 weeks, had received antimicrobial\
        \ treatment or dietary intervention or had gene knockout. In total 582 fecal\
        \ shotgun metagenomes were curated.\\n\\n## qPCR of bacterial load\\n\\nAnaerostipes\
        \ faecis and D. muricolitica were quantified in the feces of SPF mice using\
        \ qPCR with custom primers. Primers were designed using the taxon-linked gene\
        \ catalog of MGBC32. Briefly, we identified gene targets that were both unique\
        \ to, and highly conserved in, the genome of each species. To ensure target\
        \ specificity, we selected gene clusters that shared <50% sequence identity\
        \ with all nontarget species sequences. Gene targets were defined as highly\
        \ conserved if they were identified in 100% of high-quality target species\
        \ genomes in the MGBC. Furthermore, only single-copy-number gene targets were\
        \ considered. Sequences for selected gene products were then clustered at\
        \ 90% sequence identity and used as templates for design of PCR primers with\
        \ NCBI Primer-BLAST33, ensuring specificity against the NCBI nonredundant\
        \ gene catalog. Two primers for each species were used in conjunction for\
        \ qPCR.\\n\\nPrimers: A14_1 (gene target: MGBC000029_00009), forward 5'-AGCTGTTCAGGTGTCTGATCTT-3',\
        \ reverse 5'-CGGTCCACTTCGCAGTATCA-3', product size 74 bp; A14_2 (gene target:\

        \ product size 93 bp.\\n\\nDNA was extracted from feces using FastDNA Spin\
        \ Kit for Soil (MPBio) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions,\
        \ and DNA eluted into 100 \xB5l of double-distilled H2O. Eluted DNA was then\
        \ diluted 1:50 and qPCR performed using SYBR Green chemistry (Thermo Fisher).\
        \ To approximate the relative abundance of target species in SPF feces, cycle\
        \ threshold values were normalized to those of a universal bacterial 16 S\
        \ primer (F: 5'- GTGSTGCAYGGYTGTCGTCA-3'; R: 5'- ACGTCRTCCMCACCTTCCTC-3').\\\
        n\\n## Intestinal immune cell isolation\\n\\nLarge intestines were excised\
        \ and separated from mesentery and fat. Transluminal sections were taken from\
        \ the cecum and distal colon for histology. The intestines were opened longitudinally,\
        \ cleared of feces then washed three times in cold PBS. To isolate intraepithelial\
        \ immune populations, the large intestines were cut into 1-cm pieces, washed\
        \ in cold PBS then incubated in 10 ml of PBS + 1 mM dithiothreitol for 10\
        \ min. Tissues were manually disrupted via shaking and then strained, with\
        \ supernatant then collected. Tissues were incubated in 10 ml of PBS + 30\
        \ mM EDTA + 10 ml of HEPES at 37 \xB0C and 200 r.p.m., before being shaken\
        \ and strained. The supernatants from these two steps were pooled, filtered\
        \ at 70 \xB5m and the filtrate fractionated using a discontinuous Percoll\
        \ gradient (80/40%). Epithelial cells were isolated from the surface of the\
        \ Percoll, and intraepithelial immune cells isolated from the interface.\\\
        n\\nTo access the lamina propria compartment, tissues were manually chopped\
        \ and digested in HBSS + 25 mM HEPES + 1 mM sodium pyruvate containing 0.05\
        \ mg ml\u20131 Collagenase VIII (Sigma) and 50 \xB5g ml\u20131 DNase I (Sigma)\
        \ for 1 h at 37 \xB0C and 80 r.p.m. Samples were mechanically disrupted and\
        \ filtered at 70 \xB5m. The filtrate was fractionated using a discontinuous\
        \ Percoll gradient (80/40%). Lamina propria immune cells were isolated from\
        \ the interface.\\n\\n## Flow cytometry\\n\\nIntestinal and mesenteric lymph\
        \ node immune cell populations were characterized by flow cytometry. For intracellular\
        \ cytokine staining, cells were incubated in T cell medium (RPMI, 10% FBS,\
        \ 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 2 mM GLUTamax, 1\xD7 nonessential amino acids, 0.1\
        \ mM 2-\u03B2-mercaptoethanol, 10 mM HEPES, 1% penicillin/streptomycin) +\
        \ 1\xD7 Cell Stimulation Cocktail with Protein Inhibitors (eBioscience) for\
        \ 3 h at 37 \xB0C before staining. Nonviable cells were stained using Live/Dead\
        \ Fixable Aqua. Cells were permeabilized with CytoFix/CytoPerm (BD), followed\
        \ by intracellular staining in PermBuffer (eBioscience).\\n\\nAll antibodies\
        \ were purchased from eBioscience unless otherwise indicated. Antibodies used\
        \ were CD45-SB600, TCRb-APC-Cy7, MHCII-FITC, CD4-PE-Cy7, CD8a-AF700, CD8b-PE,\
        \ IFNg-PerCP-Cy5.5, TNFa-APC, IL-17A-bv421 (BioLegend), CD3e-FITC, TCRg-FITC,\

        \ SiglecF-PE (BD), Ly6G-Pe-Cy7 (BD) and F4/80-e450. Sample data were acquired\
        \ with an Attune NxT flow cytometer coupled with an Attune CytKick Max autosampler.\
        \ Data were analyzed using FlowJo v.10. Antibody details and concentrations\
        \ are included in Supplementary Table 1.\\n\\n## Bacterial species characterization\\\
        n\\nWhile genomes are publicly available for the species described in this\
        \ paper, and are represented by genomic species clusters in the Genome Taxonomy\
        \ Database: A14 = Anaerostipes sp000508985 (GCF_000508985.1: 98.76% ANI),\
        \ A43 = CAG-485 sp002362485 (GCF_003833075.1: 98.66% ANI), A60 = Duncaniella\
        \ sp001689575 (GCF_003762875.1: 96.19% ANI), A61 = Alistipes sp002362235 (GCA_002362235.1:\
        \ 98.54% ANI)). These species have not yet been characterized, nor have these\
        \ names been validly published according to the International Code of Nomenclature\
        \ of Prokaryotes. Because these species are uncharacterized, they are referred\
        \ to as previously undescribed in this manuscript. Phenotypic data for the\
        \ capacity of each species to utilize 95 substrates as sole carbon sources\
        \ were attained using the BioLog platform (see BioLog analysis for a description\
        \ of methodology). Isolated genomes were functionally annotated using eggNOG-mapper\
        \ v.2 and InterProScan v.5. We describe these species and propose new names\
        \ below.\\n\\n### Description of \u2018Alistipes okayasuensis\u2019 sp. nov\\\
        n\\nAlistipes okayasuensis (o\u2019ka.ya.su.en.sis. N.L. masc./fem. adj. okayasuensis)\
        \ is named after Isao Okayasu, who first described DSS colitis as a model\
        \ for ulcerative colitis in mice. Phylogenomic analyses place strain A61T\
        \ in the Alistipes cluster. The digital DNA\u2013DNA hybridization (dDDH)\
        \ value between A. onderdonkii and A. putredinis is 24.4%, while dDDH values\
        \ between strain A61T, A. onderdonkii and A. putredinis are 25.2 and 21.4%,\
        \ respectively. The G + C content difference between the genome of strain\
        \ A61T and A. onderdonkii, its closest phylogenomic neighbor, is 1.39%, while\
        \ their 16S rRNA gene sequence identity is 96.03%. These analyses strongly\
        \ indicate that \u2018Alistipes okayasuensis\u2019 is a separate species within\
        \ the genus Alistipes.\\n\\nThis strain is a strict anaerobe. Carbon source\
        \ utilization analysis was combined with reconstruction of Kyoto Encyclopedia\
        \ of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) metabolic pathways (55.58% of 2,022 predicted\
        \ open reading frames (ORFs) could be annotated) to functionally characterize\
        \ the strain. The strain encodes 47 genes predicted to be carbohydrate-active\
        \ enzymes (CAZymes), including 29 glycoside hydrolases: seven beta-glucosidases\
        \ (GH3, EC 3.2.1.21); five beta-galactosidases (EC 3.2.1.23); five endohydrolytic\
        \ alpha-glucosidases (GH13), including four alpha-amylases (EC 3.2.1.1); three\
        \ exohydrolytic alpha-glucosidases (GH31, EC 3.2.1.20); three cellulases (EC\
        \ 3.2.1.4); three mannan endo-1,4-beta-mannosidases (EC 3.2.1.78); and an\
        \ alpha-l-fucosidase (EC 3.2.1.51). Despite this predicted hydrolytic potential,\
        \ the strain shows limited capacity to utilize disaccharides and oligosaccharides\
        \ as sole carbon sources. While the strain tested positive for utilization\
        \ of alpha-d-lactose, sucrose and maltotriose, it tested negative for utilization\
        \ of d-cellobiose, dextrin, cyclodextrin, gentiobiose, lactulose, maltose,\
        \ d-melezitose, d-melibiose, palatinose, d-raffinose, stachyose, d-trehalose,\
        \ fucose or turanose.\\n\\nThe strain is predicted to encode enzymes for metabolism\
        \ of l-histidine to l-glutamate via 4-Imidazolone-5-phsophate (EC 4.3.1.3,\
        \ EC 4.2.1.49, EC 3.5.2.7, EC 2.1.2.5). In support of these predictions, the\
        \ strain is capable of utilizing urocanate as a sole carbon source. In keeping\
        \ with other members of the genus Alistipes, this strain is predicted to encode\
        \ a putative tryptophanase (EC 4.1.99.1) that would allow it to hydrolyze\
        \ tryptophan to indole. The strain is also predicted to encode a butyrate\
        \ phosphotransferase (EC 2.3.1.19) and a butyrate kinase (EC 2.7.2.7), indicating\
        \ its potential to metabolize butyrate. The genome is 2,329,524 bp with a\
        \ G + C content of 56.45 mol%. We propose the name \u2018Alistipes okayasuensis\u2019\
        \ for this previously undescribed species, in reference to the origins of\
        \ the DSS colitis model and reflecting this species\u2019 association with\
        \ poor outcomes of this disease model. The type strain is A61T (=CCUG 75087T\
        \ =SM 112987T).\\n\\n### Description of \u2018Anaerostipes faecis\u2019 sp.\
        \ nov\\n\\nAnaerostipes faecis (fae\u2019cis. L. gen. fem. n. faecis, of feces,\
        \ referring to fecal origin). The closest phylogenomic neighbor of strain\
        \ A14T is Anaerostipes caccae, with a dDDH value of 48.40%. The pairwise 16\
        \ S rRNA gene sequence identity of A14T and A. caccae DSM 14662T is 98.16%.\
        \ These analyses indicate that A14T is a separate species within the genus\
        \ Anaerostipes. The genome is 3,200,246 bp with a G + C content of 43.77 mol%.\
        \ We propose the name \u2018Anaerostipes faecis\u2019 for this new species.\
        \ The type strain is A14T (=CCUG 75084T).\\n\\nThe strain is strictly anaerobic.\
        \ Reconstruction of KEGG metabolic pathways (55.4% of 3,222 predicted ORFs\
        \ could be annotated) indicates that the strain can produce butyrate via a\
        \ butyrate phosphotransferase/butyrate kinase operon (EC 2.7.2.7, EC 2.3.1.91),\
        \ in keeping with the genus type species A. caccae. Likewise, the strain is\
        \ predicted to encode an arginine dihydrolase (EC 3.5.3.6). In contrast to\
        \ the genus description, however, this strain is predicted to encode neither\
        \ an alpha-galactosidase (EC 3.2.1.22) nor a phosphoamidase (EC 3.9.1.1).\\\
        n\\nThe strain shows limited capacity to utilize monosaccharides as sole carbon\
        \ sources: it had a robust phenotype for utilization of 3-methyl-d-glucose\
        \ but tested negative for its ability to utilize other monosaccharides including\
        \ d-fructose, d-galactose, d-mannose or d-glucose as sole carbon sources.\
        \ Notably, the strain is predicted to encode the complete Leloir pathway for\
        \ galactose metabolism, as well as multiple beta-galactosidases (EC 3.2.1.23),\
        \ indicating that it might lack a galactose transporter but could metabolize\
        \ galactose in different contexts such as downstream of other pathways of\
        \ carbohydrate metabolism. The strain can utilize some disaccharides, testing\
        \ positive for sucrose utilization, potentially via multiple oligo-1,6-glucosidases\
        \ (EC 3.2.1.10), d-trehalose utilization, potentially via three trehalases\
        \ (EC 3.2.1.28, GH37, GH65) and turanose utilization. However, the strain\
        \ tested negative for its ability to utilize alpha-d-lactose, lactulose, maltose,\
        \ d-melibiose, gentiobiose, d-cellobiose or palatinose. Additionally, the\
        \ strain tested negative for utilization of the trisccharides maltotriose,\
        \ d-melezitose and d-raffinose and the tetrasaccharide stachyose\u2014potentially\
        \ due to the absence of a predicted alpha-galactosidase. The strain could\
        \ utilize beta-cyclodextrin, but tested negative for utilization of dextrin\
        \ and alpha-cyclodextrin. The strain is capable of utilizing alpha-ketovaleric\
        \ acid and d-malic acid, as well as certain amino acids and derivatives including\
        \ l-threonine, l-asparagine, l-serine and the dipeptides glycyl-l-proline\
        \ and l-alanyl-l-threonine. The strain tested negative for utilization of\
        \ l-glutamine, l-glutamate, l-valine and l-alanine.\\n\\n### Description of\
        \ \u2018Duncaniella muricolitica\u2019 sp. nov\\n\\nDuncaniella muricolitica\
        \ (mu.ri.co\u2019li.ti.ca. L. gen. n. muris, of the mouse; Gr. n. kolon, colon;\
        \ Gr. suff. -tikos -\xEA -on, suffix used with the sense of pertaining to;\
        \ N.L. fem. adj. muricolitica, pertaining to the colon of the mouse). The\
        \ closest phylogenetic neighbor, according to pairwise 16 S rRNA gene analyses,\
        \ is Duncaniella dubosii with a sequence identity of 94.04%. The 16 S gene\
        \ sequence identity values between D. dubosii H5T and other species of the\
        \ genus, D. muris DSM 103720T and D. freteri TLL-A3T, are 95.14 and 93.00%,\
        \ respectively, indicating that A60T is a separate species within the Duncaniella\
        \ cluster. The dDDH value between A60T and D. dubosii H5T is 28.10%, confirming\
        \ a separate species status.\\n\\nRecent work benchmarking an average nucleotide\
        \ identity1 approach to define genus boundaries found that the genus inflection\
        \ points of members of the order Bacteroidales had relatively low values for\
        \ alignment fraction (AF) and ANI (AF/ANI: Bacteroides fragilis, 0.215/71.23;\
        \ Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, 0.105/68.12; Prevotella melaninogenica, 0.195/72.07).\
        \ The corresponding values between A60T and the genus type species D. muris\
        \ are 0.243/80.85, providing further evidence that A60T belongs to the genus\
        \ Duncaniella.\\n\\nThe strain is an obligate anaerobe. Reconstruction of\
        \ KEGG metabolic pathways (47.2% of 3,461 predicted ORFs could be annotated)\
        \ indicated that strain is enriched for enzymes with glycoside hydrolase activity,\
        \ encoding 47 in total. The strain is able to utilize dextrin, beta-cyclodextrin\

        \ median age 11 weeks; s.d. 12 days) from 14 distinct parental lineages (that\

        \ in the weight change of mice treated with DSS, with the response ranging\
        \ from 12% weight gain to 30% weight loss across the cohort (Fig. 1c). Regression\

        \ identify the primary factors determining disease outcome, we established\
        \ a random forest classifier model incorporating mouse sex, age, lineage,\
        \ parents, mouse room and experimental date to assess the relative importance\
        \ of each of these factors (Extended Data Fig. 1). The strongest predictive\
        \ factor for weight loss and histology score, both together and independently\
        \ in these genetically identical C57BL/6N mice maintained under standardized\
        \ SPF conditions within the same facility, was parental lineage, with correlation\
        \ analysis confirming these associations (P < 0.01, Kruskal\u2013Wallis; Extended\
        \ Data Fig. 1).Since all mice were derived from the same genetic founder stock,\
        \ the most likely mediator of their DSS phenotype was an extrinsic lineage-specific\
        \ factor. However, to exclude the role of host genetics or epigenetic differences\
        \ between colonies, and to determine whether the microbiota alone could be\
        \ responsible for the observed phenotypic variation, fecal samples were collected\
        \ from SPF mice (without DSS treatment) from parental lineages that represented\
        \ extremes of disease outcome and were used to colonize C57BL/6N germ-free\
        \ mice. These colonized recipient mice were then subjected to DSS treatment\
        \ involving daily weight measurements, with colon sections collected and analyzed\
        \ histologically 10 days after the initiation of DSS treatment. Recipient\
        \ mice exhibited both weight loss and pathology scores not statistically different\

        \ significantly between disease- and non-associated lineages (P = 0.0002,\

        \ established the importance of the microbiota in mediation of phenotypic\
        \ outcomes to DSS in genetically identical mice, we next sought to understand\
        \ the degree of variability in the mouse microbiota across a single facility,\
        \ and to define changes in the microbiota that occur with DSS treatment. Fecal\
        \ samples were collected before DSS treatment and 10 days after DSS exposure,\
        \ and subjected to taxonomic profiling with 16 S ribosomal RNA amplicon sequencing\
        \ to determine microbiota community composition. Consistent with previous\
        \ reports of gastrointestinal inflammation, this analysis demonstrated a clear\
        \ separation of microbiome community between pre- and post-DSS samples (Fig.\
        \ 2b,c and Extended Data Figs. 2 and 3) and a significant reduction in bacterial\
        \ diversity (Shannon diversity index, P = 0.0357; Fig. 2d)12. Although expansion\
        \ of Proteobacteria is often associated with gut microbiome dysbiosis, while\
        \ an increase in Proteobacteria was observed post DSS (P < 0.05, Kolmogorov\u2013\
        Smirnov test), limited association was observed between weight loss and Proteobacteria\
        \ proportion either pre (Fig. 2e; Spearman correlation, 0.196) or post DSS\
        \ treatment (Fig. 2e; Spearman correlation, \u22120.289). This suggests that\
        \ other gut bacteria may be contributing to the observed variation in DSS\
        \ resistance and susceptibility.Given the transmissibility of disease phenotype\
        \ we observed in the germ-free mouse experiments, we reasoned that the observed\
        \ phenotypic variation was primarily dependent on baseline microbiota composition\
        \ before DSS treatment. To understand the composition of microbiota associated\
        \ with increased risk of disease outcome, we applied linear discriminant analysis\
        \ to gut microbiota composition before and after DSS exposure24. This unsupervised\
        \ analysis leveraged the variability between mouse lineage-specific bacteria\
        \ to identify the bacterial taxa that most closely predict DSS response. Using\
        \ this approach, we identified two statistically different bacterial taxa\
        \ associated with no disease, and five statistically different bacterial taxa\
        \ associated with >5% weight loss. Notably, no relationship was observed between\
        \ the occurrence or abundance of these isolates in mice before DSS exposure,\
        \ and equivalent predictive bacterial taxa were not identified within the\
        \ microbiota of mice after DSS exposure. Our results suggest that the presence\
        \ of specific gut bacterial taxa before DSS exposure may influence disease\
        \ severity and outcome, possibly by either priming or protection from disease.Isolation\
        \ of bacterial species for functional validationWhile we show clear associations\
        \ between specific bacterial taxa and DSS-mediated disease outcome using 16\
        \ S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing, accurate taxonomic identification to strain\
        \ level and experimental validation require the isolation and genome sequencing\
        \ of pure clonal cultures of bacterial strains. To target and purify bacterial\
        \ strains, we next performed broad-based culture of ~2,000 bacterial colonies\
        \ from mouse fecal samples. The resulting isolates were identified by capillary\
        \ 16 S rRNA gene sequencing and included four previously identified bacterial\
        \ taxa, two \u2018disease associated\u2019 and two \u2018health associated\u2019\
        . These isolates were subjected to whole-genome sequencing and genomic analysis\
        \ to aid in precise taxonomic and phylogenetic assignment (Extended Data Fig.\
        \ 4). In addition, we performed extensive phenotypic characterization and\
        \ comparative genome analyses of these four species (Methods) as a basis to\
        \ provisionally name the health-associated bacteria Anaerostipes faecis and\
        \ Sangeribacter muris and the disease-associated bacteria Duncaniella muricolitica\
        \ and Alistipes okayasuensis; of note, the last three species are mouse specific.\
        \ Examination of the relative abundance of each of these species before DSS\
        \ treatment identified significantly higher levels of A. faecis (P = 0264,\
        \ t-test) and S. muris (P = 0.0010, t-test) in those mice without weight loss,\
        \ and significantly higher levels of D. muricolitica (P = 0.0351, t-test)\
        \ and A. okayasuensis (P = 0.0006, t-test) in mice that experienced >5% weight\
        \ loss (Fig. 2f).We next repeated the DSS experimental model in either germ-free\
        \ mice or germ-free mice stably monocolonized for 4 weeks with one of these\
        \ four bacterial strains (Extended Data Figs. 5a and 6). Control germ-free\
        \ mice treated with DSS neither lost weight (Fig. 3a) nor experienced mortality\
        \ (Fig. 3b) over the course of the experiment, suggesting that the presence\
        \ of gut bacteria is important in triggering overt disease in our facility.\
        \ Comparable experimental outcomes were observed in DSS-treated, germ-free\
        \ mice monocolonized with either of the health-associated bacteria, which\
        \ did not lose weight or develop intestinal pathology (Fig. 3a) nor experienced\
        \ significant mortality (Fig. 3b). In contrast, when DSS-treated mice were\
        \ monocolonized with either of the disease-associated bacteria, we observed\
        \ more rapid and greater weight loss (Fig. 3a) and significantly reduced survival\
        \ (Fig. 3b). Therefore, we identified and validated D. muricolitica and A.\
        \ okayasuensis as mouse bacteria that can promote disease not observed in\
        \ mice monocolonized with the commensal bacteria S. muris and A. faecis.Fig.\

        \ inflammatory immune responses in the intestine potentially caused by disease-associated\
        \ versus health-associated species, we next examined histology, immune cell\
        \ populations and cytokine production. The human-colonizing A. faecis and\
        \ the facility-prevalent D. muricolitica were chosen as exemplary disease-\
        \ and health-associated bacteria, respectively, for these analyses. Flow cytometric\
        \ analysis of intestinal lamina propria leukocytes isolated from germ-free\
        \ mice monocolonized for 4 weeks with either A. faecis or D. muricolitica\
        \ revealed that colonization with either strain did not significantly impact\
        \ the composition of intestinal leukocyte and lymphocyte subsets (Extended\
        \ Data Figs. 5b,c and 6). However, the perturbation and epithelial disruption\
        \ induced by DSS led to significantly increased inflammatory CD64+CD11c+ monocytes/macrophages\
        \ in the lamina propria compartment of the large intestine in D. muricolitica\
        \ monocolonized mice, but not in A. faecis monocolonized mice (Extended Data\
        \ Figs. 5c,d and 6). These monocytes have been shown to play a pathogenic\
        \ role in the intestine in the context of Helicobacter-induced inflammation25.\
        \ This suggests that, although neither pathogenic nor immunogenic at homeostasis,\
        \ D. muricolitica drives increased inflammatory responses in the wake of epithelial\
        \ damage whereas health-associated A. faecis does not. Importantly, while\
        \ histological samples taken after 7 days of DSS treatment from colons and\
        \ caeca of D. muricolitica monocolonized mice occasionally exhibited features\
        \ of severe inflammation, this was not statistically different from that of\
        \ A. faecis monocolonized mice (Fig. 3c,d) and did not consistently correspond\
        \ to the weight loss observed. This again suggests that weight loss in the\
        \ DSS model may not always correlate with intestinal inflammation and pathology.To\
        \ determine whether the presence of D. muricolitica or A. faecis had a positive\
        \ or negative correlation with weight change, we next examined 20 independent\
        \ mice and assessed the relationship between bacterial levels using quantitative\
        \ PCR (qPCR) before DSS treatment and weight change observed at day 10. This\
        \ analysis identified a positive correlation between weight change and pre-DSS\
        \ A. faecis abundance (R = 0.3679, P = 0.0046; Fig. 3e). Similarly, a negative\
        \ correlation was observed between weight change and D. muricolitica abundance\
        \ (R2 = 0.3626, P = 0.0050; Fig. 3e). This independent confirmation provides\
        \ further validation of the relationship between these species and the severity\
        \ of DSS colitis; however, additional work is needed to confirm their roles\
        \ as pathobionts.Global distribution and prevalence in other mouse facilitiesBecause\
        \ D. muricolitica and A. okayasuensis affected the outcome of DSS colitis\
        \ in our mouse facility, we next explored the presence and distribution of\
        \ these bacteria in other mouse facilities around the world. To do so, we\
        \ first generated a global representation of laboratory mouse intestinal microbiomes\
        \ by curating 582 publicly available shotgun metagenome samples from \u2018\
        control\u2019, SPF mice. We combined this dataset with shotgun metagenomes\
        \ from feces of 40 mice at the Wellcome Sanger Institute to yield a global\
        \ mouse gut microbiome dataset covering 31 institutes across 12 countries.\
        \ We then determined the prevalence and abundance of health-associated bacteria\
        \ S. muris and A. faecis and disease-associated bacteria D. muricolitica and\
        \ A. okayasuensis in this mouse microbiome dataset.Duncaniella muricolitica\
        \ and A. okayasuensis were both dominant members of the mouse microbiome,\
        \ present in 54.5 and 47.9% of samples and with a mean abundance of 0.52 and\
        \ 0.48% reads per sample, respectively. Importantly, D. muricolitica and A.\
        \ okayasuensis were each detected in 80.6% (25/31) of the institutes included\
        \ in the analyses (Fig. 4), and there were only three institutes that did\
        \ not contain either of these species. For comparison, among health-associated\
        \ species S. muris was the most dominant in the mouse gut microbiota, present\
        \ in 96.5% of samples with a mean abundance of 6.2% reads, while A. faecis\
        \ was a relatively minor species, present in 5.9% of samples with a mean abundance\
        \ of 0.22% reads. S. muris was present in all (31/31) of the institutes included\
        \ in the analyses, whereas A. faecis was detected in 25.8% (8/31). The abundance\
        \ of each species also differed between institutes (Fig. 4). Thus, we show\
        \ that mouse-derived bacteria cultured from our institute are common mouse\
        \ symbionts and, importantly, D. muricolitica and A. okayasuensis are common,\
        \ but not ubiquitous, in animal facilities around the world.Fig. 4Global epidemiology\

        \ model, which limits the interpretation and translation of data, the model\
        \ is increasingly used in basic research (>6,000 DSS model publications on\
        \ PubMed) and by the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. Cohousing,\
        \ heterozygote mating and other experimental procedures have been used in\
        \ an attempt to normalize the microbiota within experiments and ensure direct\
        \ measures of the effects of mouse genetic background on disease phenotype\
        \ rather than indirect and unknown microbiota-associated effects26. In our\
        \ approach we leveraged this variability in DSS outcome, in combination with\
        \ microbiome analysis, machine learning, anerobic culturing and germ-free\
        \ mouse validation experiments, to gain relevant biological insight into microbiota\
        \ determinants of DSS disease. While this consideration of the microbiome\
        \ did not completely eliminate the impact of multidimensionality in the DSS\
        \ model, we identified and undertook experimental validation of D. muricolitica\
        \ and A. okayasuensis, both of which have a dominant effect on DSS outcome.Interestingly,\
        \ D. muricolitica and A. okayasuensis are phylogenetically distinct from each\
        \ other and neither had computationally predicted virulence factors within\
        \ their genome. While it remains unclear how these isolates contribute to\
        \ DSS disease, both exhibit a potential for polysaccharide utilization that\
        \ may mediate this relationship through interaction with the mucus layer.\
        \ We also noted that weight loss and intestinal pathology do not always correlate,\
        \ so they should not necessarily be used as surrogates for each other. Similarly,\
        \ substantial weight loss was observed in monocolonized mice even in the absence\
        \ of severe inflammation, suggesting that activation of key pathways alone\
        \ can have a substantial impact on experimental outcome. Together, these insights\
        \ raise the need for further experimental study of host interactions and the\
        \ biology of these important mouse-specific bacteria.We propose that researchers\
        \ should consider monitoring for D. muricolitica and A. okayasuensis in their\
        \ mouse facilities, as is undertaken for other immunophenotyped-affecting\
        \ microbes such as segmented filamentous bacteria27. In some cases, precolonization\
        \ of animals with these bacteria, if they are not present in the facility,\
        \ may yield better experimental control and increase confidence in this important\
        \ and widely used mouse model of human disease. Overall, our work suggests\
        \ that the application of metagenomics techniques to report microbiota composition,\
        \ in addition to the genetic and disease phenotypes being described, should\
        \ represent a standard minimum requirement for the DSS mouse model. We have\
        \ deposited the D. muricolitis, A. okayasuensis, S. muris and A. faecis strains\
        \ and genomes in public repositories to support this work.\",\"methods\":\"\
        MethodsMouse modelsMice were maintained under either germ-free or SPF conditions\

        \ to obtain inflammation scores for each mouse colon.Monocolonized, germ-free\
        \ mice were euthanized 7 days after DSS administration and samples taken from\
        \ the cecum and midcolon. Tissue sections were fixed in methacarn, paraffin\

        \ was graded on a semiquantitative scale by a pathologist blinded to the groups.\
        \ The criteria scored were (1) degree of epithelial hyperplasia/damage and\
        \ goblet cell depletion; (2) severity of leukocyte infiltration in lamina\
        \ propria; (3) extent of inflammation; and (4) presence of markers of severe\
        \ inflammation, including crypt abscesses, submucosal inflammation and edema.\
        \ Each criterion was scored on a scale of zero to three based on previously\
        \ described thresholds28 and the sum of the individual scores was recorded\
        \ as an indication of overall inflammation. For all animal experiments, treatments\
        \ were randomized by cage by researchers blinded to treatment conditions.\
        \ For statistical analysis, distribution was assumed to be normal but this\

        \ in equimolar amounts for 150-base-paired (bp)-end sequencing with the Illumina\
        \ MiSeq platform. For shotgun metagenomic sequencing, samples with >100 ng\

        \ 16 S rRNA amplicon sequences was performed with mothur MiSeq SOP v.1.42.3\
        \ using SILVA v.132 (ref. 29). The 16 S rRNA gene alignments were used to\
        \ determine maximum likelihood phylogeny using FastTree v.2.1.10 (ref. 30).\
        \ Phylogenetic trees were visualized and edited using iTOL31. Shotgun metagenomic\
        \ reads were filtered for quality and adapter sequences using KneadData v.0.7.3,\
        \ with default settings. Host reads were removed from samples using the GRCm39\
        \ reference genome and Bowtie2 v.2.3.5. In addition, reads were aligned to\
        \ the Phi X 174 genome and removed. Taxonomic classification of metagenomic\
        \ reads was performed using Kraken2 v.2.0.8 and a custom database built from\
        \ the genomes of the Mouse Gut Bacterial Catalog (MGBC).All data analyses\
        \ were performed in R v.4.0.2. Species abundant at \u22650.01% reads were\
        \ considered present in a sample, and operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were\
        \ considered statistically different at P < 0.05. For shotgun metagenomic\
        \ sequencing, relative abundance of species was corrected using Bracken v.2.5.2.\
        \ Bar plots for species prevalence data and sample numbers were generated\
        \ using the ggplot2 v.3.3.3 package. To quantify and visualize intrainstitute\
        \ abundance, species abundance data for each sample underwent Bayesian multiplicative\
        \ replacement of zero counts using the zCompositions v.1.3.4 package, and\
        \ the data transformed using center log-ratio normalization. Mean abundance\
        \ per sample was then calculated and visualized using the pheatmap v.1.0.12\
        \ package. Principal component analyses were performed in R, and linear regression\
        \ analysis was performed using the linear regression function in python scikit-learn\
        \ v.0.20.4. Alpha diversity was assessed using Vegan v.2.5.6 (ref. 30). Correlation\
        \ analysis was performed using Spearman\u2019s rank correlation coefficient.Curation\
        \ of public metagenome samplesTo assess the abundance of both health- and\
        \ disease-associated bacteria in mice from different institutes, we curated\
        \ publicly available fecal shotgun metagenomes for healthy, control SPF mice\
        \ from NCBI and ENA. These samples included mice from different genetic backgrounds\
        \ and strains, but samples were excluded if mice were younger than 3 weeks,\
        \ had received antimicrobial treatment or dietary intervention or had gene\
        \ knockout. In total 582 fecal shotgun metagenomes were curated.qPCR of bacterial\
        \ loadAnaerostipes faecis and D. muricolitica were quantified in the feces\
        \ of SPF mice using qPCR with custom primers. Primers were designed using\
        \ the taxon-linked gene catalog of MGBC32. Briefly, we identified gene targets\
        \ that were both unique to, and highly conserved in, the genome of each species.\
        \ To ensure target specificity, we selected gene clusters that shared <50%\
        \ sequence identity with all nontarget species sequences. Gene targets were\
        \ defined as highly conserved if they were identified in 100% of high-quality\
        \ target species genomes in the MGBC. Furthermore, only single-copy-number\
        \ gene targets were considered. Sequences for selected gene products were\
        \ then clustered at 90% sequence identity and used as templates for design\
        \ of PCR primers with NCBI Primer-BLAST33, ensuring specificity against the\
        \ NCBI nonredundant gene catalog. Two primers for each species were used in\
        \ conjunction for qPCR.Primers: A14_1 (gene target: MGBC000029_00009), forward\

        \ 93 bp.DNA was extracted from feces using FastDNA Spin Kit for Soil (MPBio)\
        \ according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions, and DNA eluted into 100\
        \ \xB5l of double-distilled H2O. Eluted DNA was then diluted 1:50 and qPCR\
        \ performed using SYBR Green chemistry (Thermo Fisher). To approximate the\
        \ relative abundance of target species in SPF feces, cycle threshold values\
        \ were normalized to those of a universal bacterial 16 S primer (F: 5'- GTGSTGCAYGGYTGTCGTCA-3';\
        \ R: 5'- ACGTCRTCCMCACCTTCCTC-3').Intestinal immune cell isolationLarge intestines\
        \ were excised and separated from mesentery and fat. Transluminal sections\
        \ were taken from the cecum and distal colon for histology. The intestines\
        \ were opened longitudinally, cleared of feces then washed three times in\
        \ cold PBS. To isolate intraepithelial immune populations, the large intestines\
        \ were cut into 1-cm pieces, washed in cold PBS then incubated in 10 ml of\
        \ PBS + 1 mM dithiothreitol for 10 min. Tissues were manually disrupted via\
        \ shaking and then strained, with supernatant then collected. Tissues were\
        \ incubated in 10 ml of PBS + 30 mM EDTA + 10 ml of HEPES at 37 \xB0C and\
        \ 200 r.p.m., before being shaken and strained. The supernatants from these\
        \ two steps were pooled, filtered at 70 \xB5m and the filtrate fractionated\
        \ using a discontinuous Percoll gradient (80/40%). Epithelial cells were isolated\
        \ from the surface of the Percoll, and intraepithelial immune cells isolated\
        \ from the interface.To access the lamina propria compartment, tissues were\
        \ manually chopped and digested in HBSS + 25 mM HEPES + 1 mM sodium pyruvate\

        \ v.5. We describe these species and propose new names below.Description of\
        \ \u2018Alistipes okayasuensis\u2019 sp. novAlistipes okayasuensis (o\u2019\
        ka.ya.su.en.sis. N.L. masc./fem. adj. okayasuensis) is named after Isao Okayasu,\
        \ who first described DSS colitis as a model for ulcerative colitis in mice.\
        \ Phylogenomic analyses place strain A61T in the Alistipes cluster. The digital\
        \ DNA\u2013DNA hybridization (dDDH) value between A. onderdonkii and A. putredinis\
        \ is 24.4%, while dDDH values between strain A61T, A. onderdonkii and A. putredinis\
        \ are 25.2 and 21.4%, respectively. The G + C content difference between the\
        \ genome of strain A61T and A. onderdonkii, its closest phylogenomic neighbor,\
        \ is 1.39%, while their 16S rRNA gene sequence identity is 96.03%. These analyses\
        \ strongly indicate that \u2018Alistipes okayasuensis\u2019 is a separate\
        \ species within the genus Alistipes.This strain is a strict anaerobe. Carbon\
        \ source utilization analysis was combined with reconstruction of Kyoto Encyclopedia\
        \ of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) metabolic pathways (55.58% of 2,022 predicted\
        \ open reading frames (ORFs) could be annotated) to functionally characterize\
        \ the strain. The strain encodes 47 genes predicted to be carbohydrate-active\
        \ enzymes (CAZymes), including 29 glycoside hydrolases: seven beta-glucosidases\
        \ (GH3, EC 3.2.1.21); five beta-galactosidases (EC 3.2.1.23); five endohydrolytic\
        \ alpha-glucosidases (GH13), including four alpha-amylases (EC 3.2.1.1); three\
        \ exohydrolytic alpha-glucosidases (GH31, EC 3.2.1.20); three cellulases (EC\
        \ 3.2.1.4); three mannan endo-1,4-beta-mannosidases (EC 3.2.1.78); and an\
        \ alpha-l-fucosidase (EC 3.2.1.51). Despite this predicted hydrolytic potential,\
        \ the strain shows limited capacity to utilize disaccharides and oligosaccharides\
        \ as sole carbon sources. While the strain tested positive for utilization\
        \ of alpha-d-lactose, sucrose and maltotriose, it tested negative for utilization\
        \ of d-cellobiose, dextrin, cyclodextrin, gentiobiose, lactulose, maltose,\
        \ d-melezitose, d-melibiose, palatinose, d-raffinose, stachyose, d-trehalose,\
        \ fucose or turanose.The strain is predicted to encode enzymes for metabolism\
        \ of l-histidine to l-glutamate via 4-Imidazolone-5-phsophate (EC 4.3.1.3,\
        \ EC 4.2.1.49, EC 3.5.2.7, EC 2.1.2.5). In support of these predictions, the\
        \ strain is capable of utilizing urocanate as a sole carbon source. In keeping\
        \ with other members of the genus Alistipes, this strain is predicted to encode\
        \ a putative tryptophanase (EC 4.1.99.1) that would allow it to hydrolyze\
        \ tryptophan to indole. The strain is also predicted to encode a butyrate\
        \ phosphotransferase (EC 2.3.1.19) and a butyrate kinase (EC 2.7.2.7), indicating\
        \ its potential to metabolize butyrate. The genome is 2,329,524 bp with a\
        \ G + C content of 56.45 mol%. We propose the name \u2018Alistipes okayasuensis\u2019\
        \ for this previously undescribed species, in reference to the origins of\
        \ the DSS colitis model and reflecting this species\u2019 association with\
        \ poor outcomes of this disease model. The type strain is A61T (=CCUG 75087T\
        \ =SM 112987T).Description of \u2018Anaerostipes faecis\u2019 sp. novAnaerostipes\
        \ faecis (fae\u2019cis. L. gen. fem. n. faecis, of feces, referring to fecal\
        \ origin). The closest phylogenomic neighbor of strain A14T is Anaerostipes\
        \ caccae, with a dDDH value of 48.40%. The pairwise 16 S rRNA gene sequence\
        \ identity of A14T and A. caccae DSM 14662T is 98.16%. These analyses indicate\
        \ that A14T is a separate species within the genus Anaerostipes. The genome\
        \ is 3,200,246 bp with a G + C content of 43.77 mol%. We propose the name\
        \ \u2018Anaerostipes faecis\u2019 for this new species. The type strain is\
        \ A14T (=CCUG 75084T).The strain is strictly anaerobic. Reconstruction of\
        \ KEGG metabolic pathways (55.4% of 3,222 predicted ORFs could be annotated)\
        \ indicates that the strain can produce butyrate via a butyrate phosphotransferase/butyrate\
        \ kinase operon (EC 2.7.2.7, EC 2.3.1.91), in keeping with the genus type\
        \ species A. caccae. Likewise, the strain is predicted to encode an arginine\
        \ dihydrolase (EC 3.5.3.6). In contrast to the genus description, however,\
        \ this strain is predicted to encode neither an alpha-galactosidase (EC 3.2.1.22)\
        \ nor a phosphoamidase (EC 3.9.1.1).The strain shows limited capacity to utilize\
        \ monosaccharides as sole carbon sources: it had a robust phenotype for utilization\
        \ of 3-methyl-d-glucose but tested negative for its ability to utilize other\
        \ monosaccharides including d-fructose, d-galactose, d-mannose or d-glucose\
        \ as sole carbon sources. Notably, the strain is predicted to encode the complete\
        \ Leloir pathway for galactose metabolism, as well as multiple beta-galactosidases\
        \ (EC 3.2.1.23), indicating that it might lack a galactose transporter but\
        \ could metabolize galactose in different contexts such as downstream of other\
        \ pathways of carbohydrate metabolism. The strain can utilize some disaccharides,\
        \ testing positive for sucrose utilization, potentially via multiple oligo-1,6-glucosidases\
        \ (EC 3.2.1.10), d-trehalose utilization, potentially via three trehalases\
        \ (EC 3.2.1.28, GH37, GH65) and turanose utilization. However, the strain\
        \ tested negative for its ability to utilize alpha-d-lactose, lactulose, maltose,\
        \ d-melibiose, gentiobiose, d-cellobiose or palatinose. Additionally, the\
        \ strain tested negative for utilization of the trisccharides maltotriose,\
        \ d-melezitose and d-raffinose and the tetrasaccharide stachyose\u2014potentially\
        \ due to the absence of a predicted alpha-galactosidase. The strain could\
        \ utilize beta-cyclodextrin, but tested negative for utilization of dextrin\
        \ and alpha-cyclodextrin. The strain is capable of utilizing alpha-ketovaleric\
        \ acid and d-malic acid, as well as certain amino acids and derivatives including\
        \ l-threonine, l-asparagine, l-serine and the dipeptides glycyl-l-proline\
        \ and l-alanyl-l-threonine. The strain tested negative for utilization of\
        \ l-glutamine, l-glutamate, l-valine and l-alanine.Description of \u2018Duncaniella\

        \ according to pairwise 16 S rRNA gene analyses, is Duncaniella dubosii with\
        \ a sequence identity of 94.04%. The 16 S gene sequence identity values between\
        \ D. dubosii H5T and other species of the genus, D. muris DSM 103720T and\
        \ D. freteri TLL-A3T, are 95.14 and 93.00%, respectively, indicating that\
        \ A60T is a separate species within the Duncaniella cluster. The dDDH value\
        \ between A60T and D. dubosii H5T is 28.10%, confirming a separate species\
        \ status.Recent work benchmarking an average nucleotide identity1 approach\
        \ to define genus boundaries found that the genus inflection points of members\
        \ of the order Bacteroidales had relatively low values for alignment fraction\
        \ (AF) and ANI (AF/ANI: Bacteroides fragilis, 0.215/71.23; Porphyromonas asaccharolytica,\
        \ 0.105/68.12; Prevotella melaninogenica, 0.195/72.07). The corresponding\
        \ values between A60T and the genus type species D. muris are 0.243/80.85,\
        \ providing further evidence that A60T belongs to the genus Duncaniella.The\
        \ strain is an obligate anaerobe. Reconstruction of KEGG metabolic pathways\
        \ (47.2% of 3,461 predicted ORFs could be annotated) indicated that strain\
        \ is enriched for enzymes with glycoside hydrolase activity, encoding 47 in\
        \ total. The strain is able to utilize dextrin, beta-cyclodextrin and multiple\
        \ oligosaccharides including d-melezitose, maltotriose, amygdalin, maltose,\
        \ gentiobiose (EC: 3.2.1.21), turanose and d-cellobiose (EC: 2.4.1.20; EC:\
        \ 3.2.1.21). The strain is capable of utilizing d-raffinose, and is predicted\
        \ from its genome to produce sucrose as an intermediate (EC: 3.2.1.22, EC:\
        \ 3.2.1.20) rather than stachyose or melibiose. Additionally, the strain tested\
        \ negative for utilization of both stachyose and melibiose. In our study the\
        \ strain tested negative for an ability to utilize lactose as a single carbon\
        \ source, even though it encodes seven predicted beta-galactosidases (EC 3.2.1.23).\
        \ The strain is predicted to encode 36 glycosyltransferase enzymes, among\
        \ which are seven GT2 family enzymes including two dolichyl-phosphate beta-d-mannosyltransferases\
        \ (EC: 2.4.1.82).The strain can utilize a variety of monosaccharides as single\
        \ carbon sources, including alpha-d-glucose, alpha-d-glucose 1-phosphate,\
        \ 3-methyl-d-glucose, d-galactose, alpha-methyl-d-galactose, d-mannose, adonitol,\
        \ arabinose, d-gluconate, d-arabitol and d-sorbitol. It tested negative for\
        \ an ability to utilize fucose, alpha-d-lactose, d-fructose, lactate, lactulose,\
        \ d-trehalose or l-rhamnose as sole carbon sources. The strain is predicted\
        \ to encode the pathway for metabolism of l-histidine to l-glutamate via 4-Imidazolone-5-phsophate\
        \ (EC 4.3.1.3, EC 4.2.1.49, EC 3.5.2.7, EC 2.1.2.5), and tested positive for\
        \ utilization of urocanate. The genome is 4,055,027 bp with a G + C content\
        \ of 50.9 mol%. Following functional and genomic characterization of our isolate,\
        \ we propose the name \u2018Duncaniella muricolitica\u2019 for this species\
        \ in reference to its association with poor prognosis in the murine DSS model\
        \ of colitis. The type strain is A60T (=CCUG 75086T =DSM 112986T).Description\

  reason: The actual output contains the exact expected text 'Methods' as required,
    matching the expected output verbatim. However, it adds extra explanatory sentences
    beyond the expected output, which is not penalized heavily per the evaluation

              \ models are central to basic biomedical research; however, variability\
              \ exists across genetically identical mice and mouse facilities making\
              \ comparisons difficult. Whether specific indigenous gut bacteria drive\
              \ immunophenotypic variability in mouse models of human disease remains\
              \ poorly understood. We performed a large-scale experiment using 579\
              \ genetically identical laboratory mice from a single animal facility,\
              \ designed to identify the causes of disease variability in the widely\
              \ used dextran sulphate sodium mouse model of inflammatory bowel disease.\
              \ Commonly used treatment endpoint measures\u2014weight loss and intestinal\
              \ pathology\u2014showed limited correlation and varied across mouse\
              \ lineages. Analysis of the gut microbiome, coupled with machine learning\
              \ and targeted anaerobic culturing, identified and isolated two previously\
              \ undescribed species, Duncaniella muricolitica and Alistipes okayasuensis,\
              \ and demonstrated that they exert dominant effects in the dextran sulphate\
              \ sodium model leading to variable treatment endpoint measures. We show\
              \ that the identified gut microbial species are common, but not ubiquitous,\
              \ in mouse facilities around the world, and suggest that researchers\
              \ monitor for these species to provide experimental design opportunities\
              \ for improved mouse models of human intestinal diseases.\\n\\n## Main\\\
              n\\nExperimental mouse models are central to basic biomedical research\
              \ and serve as important preclinical models in drug discovery for a\
              \ variety of human diseases, including autoimmune and metabolic disorders,\
              \ cancers and infections. Unfortunately, there is tremendous variability\
              \ in disease penetrance and reproducibility among genetically identical\
              \ mice within and between mouse facilities, limiting the utility of\
              \ many commonly used models1\u20133. Specific-pathogen-free (SPF) protocols\
              \ have been successfully employed to control the confounding effects\
              \ that can be caused by known bacterial pathogens, but we lack equivalent\
              \ knowledge of the effects of the diverse, uncharacterized symbiotic\
              \ bacteria within the indigenous gut microbiota of mice. While our knowledge\
              \ of the human gut microbiota in health and disease has expanded extensively\
              \ with large-scale microbiome studies, comprehensive computational bacterial\
              \ discovery4,5 and extensive genome-sequenced bacterial collections6\u2013\
              9, equivalent investigations in mouse models have remained limited.\
              \ The vast differences in species type, composition and dispersal between\
              \ human and mouse microbiotas highlight the importance of efforts to\
              \ culture mouse-specific bacteria and to validate their functions during\
              \ intestinal homeostasis and disease10,11.\\n\\nInflammatory bowel disease\
              \ (IBD) research relies heavily on laboratory mice to understand colitis\
              \ and the role of host genetics in disease resistance and susceptibility.\
              \ Detailed immune characterization shows colitis induction with specific\
              \ microbial communities12 or species colonization with Helicobacter\
              \ spp.13,14, Enterobacteriaceae15, Bilophila wadsworthia16 or segmented\
              \ filamentous bacteria17. Potential genetic modulators of IBD are routinely\
              \ assessed through administration of dextran sulphate sodium (DSS) at\
              \ various concentrations in drinking water, which acts by damaging the\
              \ gut epithelial barrier to trigger inflammatory disease12,13. In germ-free\
              \ mice, immune-mediated colitis is largely absent although reduced barrier\
              \ function can introduce susceptibility at higher DSS concentrations18.\
              \ Similarly, dietary changes in both germ-free and SPF mice can determine\
              \ DSS susceptibility in a microbiome-dependent and -independent manner19,\
              \ and highly specific protection is provided by the presence of Clostridium\
              \ immunis20\u201323. Despite these advances, the gut microbiota in these\
              \ mouse models, including standard SPF models, is rarely profiled at\
              \ the genomic level or cultured in the laboratory, nor robustly controlled\
              \ to understand the contribution of general gut bacteria to experimental\
              \ outcomes.\\n\\nTo quantify the variability of the widely used DSS\
              \ model of IBD and to investigate primary factors contributing to this\
              \ variability, we undertook a large-scale experiment using 579 genetically\
              \ identical laboratory mice in a single animal facility. Incorporating\
              \ standardized phenotyping, microbiome analysis and metadata collection,\
              \ this approach was designed to identify and validate the causes of\
              \ variability for standard experimental endpoints (weight loss and intestinal\
              \ pathology). Using a data-driven approach we identified, from gut microbiome\
              \ data, candidate bacterial taxa driving weight loss and intestinal\
              \ inflammation. Functional validation with cultured isolates suggests\
              \ that these specific bacterial strains can determine experimental outcomes\
              \ in gnotobiotic mice. Thus, using an experimental approach for microbiome\
              \ discovery, we identified the previously undescribed mouse gut bacteria\
              \ Duncaniella muricolitica and Alistipes okayasuensis, found frequently\
              \ in mouse colonies around the world, that impact outcomes in the DSS\
              \ model of colitis and may be acting as pathobionts.\\n\\n## Results\\\
              n\\n### Disease severity is highly variable in the DSS mouse model\\\
              n\\nWe administered 1.5% DSS through the drinking water for 7 days to\
              \ 579 identically housed, SPF wild-type C57BL/6N mice (297 males, 282\
              \ females; median age 11 weeks; s.d. 12 days) from 14 distinct parental\
              \ lineages (that is, founder matings derived from a single breeding\
              \ pair). We observed extensive variability in experimental endpoints\
              \ in these genetically identical mice at 10 days post DSS treatment,\
              \ with histological assessment of intestinal pathology of the mid and\
              \ distal colon ranging from severe inflammation, characterized by extensive\
              \ crypt loss, leukocytic infiltration and edema, to no visible inflammation\
              \ (Fig. 1a,b). Substantial variation was also observed in the weight\
              \ change of mice treated with DSS, with the response ranging from 12%\
              \ weight gain to 30% weight loss across the cohort (Fig. 1c). Regression\
              \ analysis considering histology scores and weight loss demonstrated\
              \ limited correlation (R2 = 0.27), suggesting that weight loss and intestinal\
              \ pathology outcomes, common experimental endpoint measures in the DSS\
              \ model, may be partially independent responses to DSS (Fig. 1d). This\
              \ relationship is consistent with systemic complications contributing\
              \ to experimental endpoints in the DSS model.Fig. 1Disease severity\
              \ is highly variable in the DSS mouse model.a, Representative images\
              \ of extremes of midcolon inflammatory response in wild-type C57/BL6\

              \ of 12 (bottom). b,c, Distribution of average histology scores (b)\

              \ all 579 mice. R2 = 0.273.\\n\\n### Gut microbiota is major driver\
              \ of variable response to DSS\\n\\nTo identify the primary factors determining\
              \ disease outcome, we established a random forest classifier model incorporating\
              \ mouse sex, age, lineage, parents, mouse room and experimental date\
              \ to assess the relative importance of each of these factors (Extended\
              \ Data Fig. 1). The strongest predictive factor for weight loss and\
              \ histology score, both together and independently in these genetically\
              \ identical C57BL/6N mice maintained under standardized SPF conditions\
              \ within the same facility, was parental lineage, with correlation analysis\
              \ confirming these associations (P < 0.01, Kruskal\u2013Wallis; Extended\
              \ Data Fig. 1).\\n\\nSince all mice were derived from the same genetic\
              \ founder stock, the most likely mediator of their DSS phenotype was\
              \ an extrinsic lineage-specific factor. However, to exclude the role\
              \ of host genetics or epigenetic differences between colonies, and to\
              \ determine whether the microbiota alone could be responsible for the\
              \ observed phenotypic variation, fecal samples were collected from SPF\
              \ mice (without DSS treatment) from parental lineages that represented\
              \ extremes of disease outcome and were used to colonize C57BL/6N germ-free\
              \ mice. These colonized recipient mice were then subjected to DSS treatment\
              \ involving daily weight measurements, with colon sections collected\
              \ and analyzed histologically 10 days after the initiation of DSS treatment.\
              \ Recipient mice exhibited both weight loss and pathology scores not\
              \ statistically different from those observed in the respective donor\
              \ mouse lineages, but differing significantly between disease- and non-associated\
              \ lineages (P = 0.0002, paired t-test; Fig. 2a). From these results\
              \ it is clear that, independent of other factors such as host genetics\
              \ or epigenetic lineage-specific factors, the microbiota is sufficient\
              \ to produce the observed variation in phenotypic response to DSS administration.Fig.\

              \ Discovery of bacteria that drive disease variability\\n\\nHaving established\
              \ the importance of the microbiota in mediation of phenotypic outcomes\
              \ to DSS in genetically identical mice, we next sought to understand\
              \ the degree of variability in the mouse microbiota across a single\
              \ facility, and to define changes in the microbiota that occur with\
              \ DSS treatment. Fecal samples were collected before DSS treatment and\
              \ 10 days after DSS exposure, and subjected to taxonomic profiling with\
              \ 16 S ribosomal RNA amplicon sequencing to determine microbiota community\
              \ composition. Consistent with previous reports of gastrointestinal\
              \ inflammation, this analysis demonstrated a clear separation of microbiome\
              \ community between pre- and post-DSS samples (Fig. 2b,c and Extended\
              \ Data Figs. 2 and 3) and a significant reduction in bacterial diversity\
              \ (Shannon diversity index, P = 0.0357; Fig. 2d)12. Although expansion\
              \ of Proteobacteria is often associated with gut microbiome dysbiosis,\
              \ while an increase in Proteobacteria was observed post DSS (P < 0.05,\
              \ Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test), limited association was observed between\
              \ weight loss and Proteobacteria proportion either pre (Fig. 2e; Spearman\
              \ correlation, 0.196) or post DSS treatment (Fig. 2e; Spearman correlation,\
              \ \u22120.289). This suggests that other gut bacteria may be contributing\
              \ to the observed variation in DSS resistance and susceptibility.\\\
              n\\nGiven the transmissibility of disease phenotype we observed in the\
              \ germ-free mouse experiments, we reasoned that the observed phenotypic\
              \ variation was primarily dependent on baseline microbiota composition\
              \ before DSS treatment. To understand the composition of microbiota\
              \ associated with increased risk of disease outcome, we applied linear\
              \ discriminant analysis to gut microbiota composition before and after\
              \ DSS exposure24. This unsupervised analysis leveraged the variability\
              \ between mouse lineage-specific bacteria to identify the bacterial\
              \ taxa that most closely predict DSS response. Using this approach,\
              \ we identified two statistically different bacterial taxa associated\
              \ with no disease, and five statistically different bacterial taxa associated\
              \ with >5% weight loss. Notably, no relationship was observed between\
              \ the occurrence or abundance of these isolates in mice before DSS exposure,\
              \ and equivalent predictive bacterial taxa were not identified within\
              \ the microbiota of mice after DSS exposure. Our results suggest that\
              \ the presence of specific gut bacterial taxa before DSS exposure may\
              \ influence disease severity and outcome, possibly by either priming\
              \ or protection from disease.\\n\\n### Isolation of bacterial species\
              \ for functional validation\\n\\nWhile we show clear associations between\
              \ specific bacterial taxa and DSS-mediated disease outcome using 16\
              \ S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing, accurate taxonomic identification\
              \ to strain level and experimental validation require the isolation\
              \ and genome sequencing of pure clonal cultures of bacterial strains.\
              \ To target and purify bacterial strains, we next performed broad-based\
              \ culture of ~2,000 bacterial colonies from mouse fecal samples. The\
              \ resulting isolates were identified by capillary 16 S rRNA gene sequencing\
              \ and included four previously identified bacterial taxa, two \u2018\
              disease associated\u2019 and two \u2018health associated\u2019. These\
              \ isolates were subjected to whole-genome sequencing and genomic analysis\
              \ to aid in precise taxonomic and phylogenetic assignment (Extended\
              \ Data Fig. 4). In addition, we performed extensive phenotypic characterization\
              \ and comparative genome analyses of these four species (Methods) as\
              \ a basis to provisionally name the health-associated bacteria Anaerostipes\
              \ faecis and Sangeribacter muris and the disease-associated bacteria\
              \ Duncaniella muricolitica and Alistipes okayasuensis; of note, the\
              \ last three species are mouse specific. Examination of the relative\
              \ abundance of each of these species before DSS treatment identified\
              \ significantly higher levels of A. faecis (P = 0264, t-test) and S.\
              \ muris (P = 0.0010, t-test) in those mice without weight loss, and\
              \ significantly higher levels of D. muricolitica (P = 0.0351, t-test)\
              \ and A. okayasuensis (P = 0.0006, t-test) in mice that experienced\
              \ >5% weight loss (Fig. 2f).\\n\\nWe next repeated the DSS experimental\
              \ model in either germ-free mice or germ-free mice stably monocolonized\
              \ for 4 weeks with one of these four bacterial strains (Extended Data\
              \ Figs. 5a and 6). Control germ-free mice treated with DSS neither lost\
              \ weight (Fig. 3a) nor experienced mortality (Fig. 3b) over the course\
              \ of the experiment, suggesting that the presence of gut bacteria is\
              \ important in triggering overt disease in our facility. Comparable\
              \ experimental outcomes were observed in DSS-treated, germ-free mice\
              \ monocolonized with either of the health-associated bacteria, which\
              \ did not lose weight or develop intestinal pathology (Fig. 3a) nor\
              \ experienced significant mortality (Fig. 3b). In contrast, when DSS-treated\
              \ mice were monocolonized with either of the disease-associated bacteria,\
              \ we observed more rapid and greater weight loss (Fig. 3a) and significantly\
              \ reduced survival (Fig. 3b). Therefore, we identified and validated\
              \ D. muricolitica and A. okayasuensis as mouse bacteria that can promote\
              \ disease not observed in mice monocolonized with the commensal bacteria\

              \ potentially caused by disease-associated versus health-associated\
              \ species, we next examined histology, immune cell populations and cytokine\
              \ production. The human-colonizing A. faecis and the facility-prevalent\
              \ D. muricolitica were chosen as exemplary disease- and health-associated\
              \ bacteria, respectively, for these analyses. Flow cytometric analysis\
              \ of intestinal lamina propria leukocytes isolated from germ-free mice\
              \ monocolonized for 4 weeks with either A. faecis or D. muricolitica\
              \ revealed that colonization with either strain did not significantly\
              \ impact the composition of intestinal leukocyte and lymphocyte subsets\
              \ (Extended Data Figs. 5b,c and 6). However, the perturbation and epithelial\
              \ disruption induced by DSS led to significantly increased inflammatory\
              \ CD64+CD11c+ monocytes/macrophages in the lamina propria compartment\
              \ of the large intestine in D. muricolitica monocolonized mice, but\
              \ not in A. faecis monocolonized mice (Extended Data Figs. 5c,d and\
              \ 6). These monocytes have been shown to play a pathogenic role in the\
              \ intestine in the context of Helicobacter-induced inflammation25. This\
              \ suggests that, although neither pathogenic nor immunogenic at homeostasis,\
              \ D. muricolitica drives increased inflammatory responses in the wake\
              \ of epithelial damage whereas health-associated A. faecis does not.\
              \ Importantly, while histological samples taken after 7 days of DSS\
              \ treatment from colons and caeca of D. muricolitica monocolonized mice\
              \ occasionally exhibited features of severe inflammation, this was not\
              \ statistically different from that of A. faecis monocolonized mice\
              \ (Fig. 3c,d) and did not consistently correspond to the weight loss\
              \ observed. This again suggests that weight loss in the DSS model may\
              \ not always correlate with intestinal inflammation and pathology.\\\
              n\\nTo determine whether the presence of D. muricolitica or A. faecis\
              \ had a positive or negative correlation with weight change, we next\
              \ examined 20 independent mice and assessed the relationship between\
              \ bacterial levels using quantitative PCR (qPCR) before DSS treatment\
              \ and weight change observed at day 10. This analysis identified a positive\
              \ correlation between weight change and pre-DSS A. faecis abundance\
              \ (R = 0.3679, P = 0.0046; Fig. 3e). Similarly, a negative correlation\
              \ was observed between weight change and D. muricolitica abundance (R2\
              \ = 0.3626, P = 0.0050; Fig. 3e). This independent confirmation provides\
              \ further validation of the relationship between these species and the\
              \ severity of DSS colitis; however, additional work is needed to confirm\
              \ their roles as pathobionts.\\n\\n### Global distribution and prevalence\
              \ in other mouse facilities\\n\\nBecause D. muricolitica and A. okayasuensis\
              \ affected the outcome of DSS colitis in our mouse facility, we next\
              \ explored the presence and distribution of these bacteria in other\
              \ mouse facilities around the world. To do so, we first generated a\
              \ global representation of laboratory mouse intestinal microbiomes by\
              \ curating 582 publicly available shotgun metagenome samples from \u2018\
              control\u2019, SPF mice. We combined this dataset with shotgun metagenomes\
              \ from feces of 40 mice at the Wellcome Sanger Institute to yield a\
              \ global mouse gut microbiome dataset covering 31 institutes across\
              \ 12 countries. We then determined the prevalence and abundance of health-associated\
              \ bacteria S. muris and A. faecis and disease-associated bacteria D.\
              \ muricolitica and A. okayasuensis in this mouse microbiome dataset.\\\
              n\\nDuncaniella muricolitica and A. okayasuensis were both dominant\
              \ members of the mouse microbiome, present in 54.5 and 47.9% of samples\
              \ and with a mean abundance of 0.52 and 0.48% reads per sample, respectively.\
              \ Importantly, D. muricolitica and A. okayasuensis were each detected\
              \ in 80.6% (25/31) of the institutes included in the analyses (Fig.\
              \ 4), and there were only three institutes that did not contain either\
              \ of these species. For comparison, among health-associated species\
              \ S. muris was the most dominant in the mouse gut microbiota, present\
              \ in 96.5% of samples with a mean abundance of 6.2% reads, while A.\
              \ faecis was a relatively minor species, present in 5.9% of samples\
              \ with a mean abundance of 0.22% reads. S. muris was present in all\
              \ (31/31) of the institutes included in the analyses, whereas A. faecis\
              \ was detected in 25.8% (8/31). The abundance of each species also differed\
              \ between institutes (Fig. 4). Thus, we show that mouse-derived bacteria\
              \ cultured from our institute are common mouse symbionts and, importantly,\
              \ D. muricolitica and A. okayasuensis are common, but not ubiquitous,\
              \ in animal facilities around the world.Fig. 4Global epidemiology and\

              n\\n## Disease severity is highly variable in the DSS mouse model\\\
              n\\nWe administered 1.5% DSS through the drinking water for 7 days to\
              \ 579 identically housed, SPF wild-type C57BL/6N mice (297 males, 282\
              \ females; median age 11 weeks; s.d. 12 days) from 14 distinct parental\
              \ lineages (that is, founder matings derived from a single breeding\
              \ pair). We observed extensive variability in experimental endpoints\
              \ in these genetically identical mice at 10 days post DSS treatment,\
              \ with histological assessment of intestinal pathology of the mid and\
              \ distal colon ranging from severe inflammation, characterized by extensive\
              \ crypt loss, leukocytic infiltration and edema, to no visible inflammation\
              \ (Fig. 1a,b). Substantial variation was also observed in the weight\
              \ change of mice treated with DSS, with the response ranging from 12%\
              \ weight gain to 30% weight loss across the cohort (Fig. 1c). Regression\
              \ analysis considering histology scores and weight loss demonstrated\
              \ limited correlation (R2 = 0.27), suggesting that weight loss and intestinal\
              \ pathology outcomes, common experimental endpoint measures in the DSS\
              \ model, may be partially independent responses to DSS (Fig. 1d). This\
              \ relationship is consistent with systemic complications contributing\
              \ to experimental endpoints in the DSS model.Fig. 1Disease severity\

              \ variable response to DSS\\n\\nTo identify the primary factors determining\
              \ disease outcome, we established a random forest classifier model incorporating\
              \ mouse sex, age, lineage, parents, mouse room and experimental date\
              \ to assess the relative importance of each of these factors (Extended\
              \ Data Fig. 1). The strongest predictive factor for weight loss and\
              \ histology score, both together and independently in these genetically\
              \ identical C57BL/6N mice maintained under standardized SPF conditions\
              \ within the same facility, was parental lineage, with correlation analysis\
              \ confirming these associations (P < 0.01, Kruskal\u2013Wallis; Extended\
              \ Data Fig. 1).\\n\\nSince all mice were derived from the same genetic\
              \ founder stock, the most likely mediator of their DSS phenotype was\
              \ an extrinsic lineage-specific factor. However, to exclude the role\
              \ of host genetics or epigenetic differences between colonies, and to\
              \ determine whether the microbiota alone could be responsible for the\
              \ observed phenotypic variation, fecal samples were collected from SPF\
              \ mice (without DSS treatment) from parental lineages that represented\
              \ extremes of disease outcome and were used to colonize C57BL/6N germ-free\
              \ mice. These colonized recipient mice were then subjected to DSS treatment\
              \ involving daily weight measurements, with colon sections collected\
              \ and analyzed histologically 10 days after the initiation of DSS treatment.\
              \ Recipient mice exhibited both weight loss and pathology scores not\
              \ statistically different from those observed in the respective donor\
              \ mouse lineages, but differing significantly between disease- and non-associated\
              \ lineages (P = 0.0002, paired t-test; Fig. 2a). From these results\
              \ it is clear that, independent of other factors such as host genetics\
              \ or epigenetic lineage-specific factors, the microbiota is sufficient\
              \ to produce the observed variation in phenotypic response to DSS administration.Fig.\

              \ Discovery of bacteria that drive disease variability\\n\\nHaving established\
              \ the importance of the microbiota in mediation of phenotypic outcomes\
              \ to DSS in genetically identical mice, we next sought to understand\
              \ the degree of variability in the mouse microbiota across a single\
              \ facility, and to define changes in the microbiota that occur with\
              \ DSS treatment. Fecal samples were collected before DSS treatment and\
              \ 10 days after DSS exposure, and subjected to taxonomic profiling with\
              \ 16 S ribosomal RNA amplicon sequencing to determine microbiota community\
              \ composition. Consistent with previous reports of gastrointestinal\
              \ inflammation, this analysis demonstrated a clear separation of microbiome\
              \ community between pre- and post-DSS samples (Fig. 2b,c and Extended\
              \ Data Figs. 2 and 3) and a significant reduction in bacterial diversity\
              \ (Shannon diversity index, P = 0.0357; Fig. 2d)12. Although expansion\
              \ of Proteobacteria is often associated with gut microbiome dysbiosis,\
              \ while an increase in Proteobacteria was observed post DSS (P < 0.05,\
              \ Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test), limited association was observed between\
              \ weight loss and Proteobacteria proportion either pre (Fig. 2e; Spearman\
              \ correlation, 0.196) or post DSS treatment (Fig. 2e; Spearman correlation,\
              \ \u22120.289). This suggests that other gut bacteria may be contributing\
              \ to the observed variation in DSS resistance and susceptibility.\\\
              n\\nGiven the transmissibility of disease phenotype we observed in the\
              \ germ-free mouse experiments, we reasoned that the observed phenotypic\
              \ variation was primarily dependent on baseline microbiota composition\
              \ before DSS treatment. To understand the composition of microbiota\
              \ associated with increased risk of disease outcome, we applied linear\
              \ discriminant analysis to gut microbiota composition before and after\
              \ DSS exposure24. This unsupervised analysis leveraged the variability\
              \ between mouse lineage-specific bacteria to identify the bacterial\
              \ taxa that most closely predict DSS response. Using this approach,\
              \ we identified two statistically different bacterial taxa associated\
              \ with no disease, and five statistically different bacterial taxa associated\
              \ with >5% weight loss. Notably, no relationship was observed between\
              \ the occurrence or abundance of these isolates in mice before DSS exposure,\
              \ and equivalent predictive bacterial taxa were not identified within\
              \ the microbiota of mice after DSS exposure. Our results suggest that\
              \ the presence of specific gut bacterial taxa before DSS exposure may\
              \ influence disease severity and outcome, possibly by either priming\
              \ or protection from disease.\\n\\n## Isolation of bacterial species\
              \ for functional validation\\n\\nWhile we show clear associations between\
              \ specific bacterial taxa and DSS-mediated disease outcome using 16\
              \ S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing, accurate taxonomic identification\
              \ to strain level and experimental validation require the isolation\
              \ and genome sequencing of pure clonal cultures of bacterial strains.\
              \ To target and purify bacterial strains, we next performed broad-based\
              \ culture of ~2,000 bacterial colonies from mouse fecal samples. The\
              \ resulting isolates were identified by capillary 16 S rRNA gene sequencing\
              \ and included four previously identified bacterial taxa, two \u2018\
              disease associated\u2019 and two \u2018health associated\u2019. These\
              \ isolates were subjected to whole-genome sequencing and genomic analysis\
              \ to aid in precise taxonomic and phylogenetic assignment (Extended\
              \ Data Fig. 4). In addition, we performed extensive phenotypic characterization\
              \ and comparative genome analyses of these four species (Methods) as\
              \ a basis to provisionally name the health-associated bacteria Anaerostipes\
              \ faecis and Sangeribacter muris and the disease-associated bacteria\
              \ Duncaniella muricolitica and Alistipes okayasuensis; of note, the\
              \ last three species are mouse specific. Examination of the relative\
              \ abundance of each of these species before DSS treatment identified\
              \ significantly higher levels of A. faecis (P = 0264, t-test) and S.\
              \ muris (P = 0.0010, t-test) in those mice without weight loss, and\
              \ significantly higher levels of D. muricolitica (P = 0.0351, t-test)\
              \ and A. okayasuensis (P = 0.0006, t-test) in mice that experienced\
              \ >5% weight loss (Fig. 2f).\\n\\nWe next repeated the DSS experimental\
              \ model in either germ-free mice or germ-free mice stably monocolonized\
              \ for 4 weeks with one of these four bacterial strains (Extended Data\
              \ Figs. 5a and 6). Control germ-free mice treated with DSS neither lost\
              \ weight (Fig. 3a) nor experienced mortality (Fig. 3b) over the course\
              \ of the experiment, suggesting that the presence of gut bacteria is\
              \ important in triggering overt disease in our facility. Comparable\
              \ experimental outcomes were observed in DSS-treated, germ-free mice\
              \ monocolonized with either of the health-associated bacteria, which\
              \ did not lose weight or develop intestinal pathology (Fig. 3a) nor\
              \ experienced significant mortality (Fig. 3b). In contrast, when DSS-treated\
              \ mice were monocolonized with either of the disease-associated bacteria,\
              \ we observed more rapid and greater weight loss (Fig. 3a) and significantly\
              \ reduced survival (Fig. 3b). Therefore, we identified and validated\
              \ D. muricolitica and A. okayasuensis as mouse bacteria that can promote\
              \ disease not observed in mice monocolonized with the commensal bacteria\

              \ data\\n\\nTo understand inflammatory immune responses in the intestine\
              \ potentially caused by disease-associated versus health-associated\
              \ species, we next examined histology, immune cell populations and cytokine\
              \ production. The human-colonizing A. faecis and the facility-prevalent\
              \ D. muricolitica were chosen as exemplary disease- and health-associated\
              \ bacteria, respectively, for these analyses. Flow cytometric analysis\
              \ of intestinal lamina propria leukocytes isolated from germ-free mice\
              \ monocolonized for 4 weeks with either A. faecis or D. muricolitica\
              \ revealed that colonization with either strain did not significantly\
              \ impact the composition of intestinal leukocyte and lymphocyte subsets\
              \ (Extended Data Figs. 5b,c and 6). However, the perturbation and epithelial\
              \ disruption induced by DSS led to significantly increased inflammatory\
              \ CD64+CD11c+ monocytes/macrophages in the lamina propria compartment\
              \ of the large intestine in D. muricolitica monocolonized mice, but\
              \ not in A. faecis monocolonized mice (Extended Data Figs. 5c,d and\
              \ 6). These monocytes have been shown to play a pathogenic role in the\
              \ intestine in the context of Helicobacter-induced inflammation25. This\
              \ suggests that, although neither pathogenic nor immunogenic at homeostasis,\
              \ D. muricolitica drives increased inflammatory responses in the wake\
              \ of epithelial damage whereas health-associated A. faecis does not.\
              \ Importantly, while histological samples taken after 7 days of DSS\
              \ treatment from colons and caeca of D. muricolitica monocolonized mice\
              \ occasionally exhibited features of severe inflammation, this was not\
              \ statistically different from that of A. faecis monocolonized mice\
              \ (Fig. 3c,d) and did not consistently correspond to the weight loss\
              \ observed. This again suggests that weight loss in the DSS model may\
              \ not always correlate with intestinal inflammation and pathology.\\\
              n\\nTo determine whether the presence of D. muricolitica or A. faecis\
              \ had a positive or negative correlation with weight change, we next\
              \ examined 20 independent mice and assessed the relationship between\
              \ bacterial levels using quantitative PCR (qPCR) before DSS treatment\
              \ and weight change observed at day 10. This analysis identified a positive\
              \ correlation between weight change and pre-DSS A. faecis abundance\
              \ (R = 0.3679, P = 0.0046; Fig. 3e). Similarly, a negative correlation\
              \ was observed between weight change and D. muricolitica abundance (R2\
              \ = 0.3626, P = 0.0050; Fig. 3e). This independent confirmation provides\
              \ further validation of the relationship between these species and the\
              \ severity of DSS colitis; however, additional work is needed to confirm\
              \ their roles as pathobionts.\\n\\n## Global distribution and prevalence\
              \ in other mouse facilities\\n\\nBecause D. muricolitica and A. okayasuensis\
              \ affected the outcome of DSS colitis in our mouse facility, we next\
              \ explored the presence and distribution of these bacteria in other\
              \ mouse facilities around the world. To do so, we first generated a\
              \ global representation of laboratory mouse intestinal microbiomes by\
              \ curating 582 publicly available shotgun metagenome samples from \u2018\
              control\u2019, SPF mice. We combined this dataset with shotgun metagenomes\
              \ from feces of 40 mice at the Wellcome Sanger Institute to yield a\
              \ global mouse gut microbiome dataset covering 31 institutes across\
              \ 12 countries. We then determined the prevalence and abundance of health-associated\
              \ bacteria S. muris and A. faecis and disease-associated bacteria D.\
              \ muricolitica and A. okayasuensis in this mouse microbiome dataset.\\\
              n\\nDuncaniella muricolitica and A. okayasuensis were both dominant\
              \ members of the mouse microbiome, present in 54.5 and 47.9% of samples\
              \ and with a mean abundance of 0.52 and 0.48% reads per sample, respectively.\
              \ Importantly, D. muricolitica and A. okayasuensis were each detected\
              \ in 80.6% (25/31) of the institutes included in the analyses (Fig.\
              \ 4), and there were only three institutes that did not contain either\
              \ of these species. For comparison, among health-associated species\
              \ S. muris was the most dominant in the mouse gut microbiota, present\
              \ in 96.5% of samples with a mean abundance of 6.2% reads, while A.\
              \ faecis was a relatively minor species, present in 5.9% of samples\
              \ with a mean abundance of 0.22% reads. S. muris was present in all\
              \ (31/31) of the institutes included in the analyses, whereas A. faecis\
              \ was detected in 25.8% (8/31). The abundance of each species also differed\
              \ between institutes (Fig. 4). Thus, we show that mouse-derived bacteria\
              \ cultured from our institute are common mouse symbionts and, importantly,\
              \ D. muricolitica and A. okayasuensis are common, but not ubiquitous,\
              \ in animal facilities around the world.Fig. 4Global epidemiology and\

              n\\n## Discussion\\n\\nDespite experimental variability in the DSS mouse\
              \ model, which limits the interpretation and translation of data, the\
              \ model is increasingly used in basic research (>6,000 DSS model publications\
              \ on PubMed) and by the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries.\
              \ Cohousing, heterozygote mating and other experimental procedures have\
              \ been used in an attempt to normalize the microbiota within experiments\
              \ and ensure direct measures of the effects of mouse genetic background\
              \ on disease phenotype rather than indirect and unknown microbiota-associated\
              \ effects26. In our approach we leveraged this variability in DSS outcome,\
              \ in combination with microbiome analysis, machine learning, anerobic\
              \ culturing and germ-free mouse validation experiments, to gain relevant\
              \ biological insight into microbiota determinants of DSS disease. While\
              \ this consideration of the microbiome did not completely eliminate\
              \ the impact of multidimensionality in the DSS model, we identified\
              \ and undertook experimental validation of D. muricolitica and A. okayasuensis,\
              \ both of which have a dominant effect on DSS outcome.\\n\\nInterestingly,\
              \ D. muricolitica and A. okayasuensis are phylogenetically distinct\
              \ from each other and neither had computationally predicted virulence\
              \ factors within their genome. While it remains unclear how these isolates\
              \ contribute to DSS disease, both exhibit a potential for polysaccharide\
              \ utilization that may mediate this relationship through interaction\
              \ with the mucus layer. We also noted that weight loss and intestinal\
              \ pathology do not always correlate, so they should not necessarily\
              \ be used as surrogates for each other. Similarly, substantial weight\
              \ loss was observed in monocolonized mice even in the absence of severe\
              \ inflammation, suggesting that activation of key pathways alone can\
              \ have a substantial impact on experimental outcome. Together, these\
              \ insights raise the need for further experimental study of host interactions\
              \ and the biology of these important mouse-specific bacteria.\\n\\nWe\
              \ propose that researchers should consider monitoring for D. muricolitica\
              \ and A. okayasuensis in their mouse facilities, as is undertaken for\
              \ other immunophenotyped-affecting microbes such as segmented filamentous\
              \ bacteria27. In some cases, precolonization of animals with these bacteria,\
              \ if they are not present in the facility, may yield better experimental\
              \ control and increase confidence in this important and widely used\
              \ mouse model of human disease. Overall, our work suggests that the\
              \ application of metagenomics techniques to report microbiota composition,\
              \ in addition to the genetic and disease phenotypes being described,\
              \ should represent a standard minimum requirement for the DSS mouse\
              \ model. We have deposited the D. muricolitis, A. okayasuensis, S. muris\
              \ and A. faecis strains and genomes in public repositories to support\
              \ this work.\\n\\n## Methods\\n\\n### Mouse models\\n\\nMice were maintained\

              \ Act of 1986 under Home Office approval (PPL no. 80/2643). Germ-free\
              \ mice were maintained in positive-pressure isolators (Bell), with feces\
              \ tested by culture, microscopy and PCR to ensure sterility. Consumables\
              \ were autoclaved at 121 \xB0C for 15 min before introduction into the\
              \ isolators. For experimentation, cages were opened in a vaporized hydrogen\
              \ peroxide-sterilized, class II cabinet (Bioquell), with fecal transplant\
              \ and monocolonized gnotobiotic lines generated by weekly oral gavage\
              \ over a 3-week period. Materials were prepared in Dulbecco\u2019s PBS\
              \ at 100 mg ml\u20131 immediately before administration under anaerobic\
              \ conditions (10% H, 10% CO2, 80% N) in a Whitley DG250 workstation\
              \ at 37 \xB0C (ref. 8). Mice were maintained in sterile ISOcages (Tecniplast)\
              \ and housed on ISOrack for the period of the experiment.\\n\\n### DSS\
              \ colitis challenge\\n\\nDextran sulphate sodium was administered at\
              \ a concentration of 1.5% (w/v) (Affymetrix, Inc., average molecular\
              \ weight 44 kDa) in drinking water for 7 days, followed by 3 days with\
              \ regular drinking water, to C57BL6/6N mice aged 7\u201316 weeks (297\
              \ male, 282 female; median age 11 weeks; s.d. 12 days). Mice were weighed\
              \ every day and culled if weight loss reached 20% of starting weight.\
              \ Average weight loss curves were censored for each group when the first\
              \ member of the group reached this endpoint, to avoid misleading calculations\
              \ of the average using the remaining members. No statistical methods\
              \ were used to predetermine sample sizes in these experiments.\\n\\\
              n### Histological assessment of intestinal inflammation\\n\\nDextran\
              \ sulphate sodium-treated SPF mice were sacrificed at day 10 by cervical\
              \ dislocation, and samples from mid and distal colon taken. Tissue sections\
              \ were fixed in buffered 10% formalin, paraffin embedded, cut and stained\
              \ with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Colon histopathology was blind-graded\
              \ semiquantitatively, on a scale from zero to three, for four criteria:\
              \ (1) degree of epithelial hyperplasia/damage and goblet cell depletion;\
              \ (2) leukocyte infiltration in lamina propria; (3) area of tissue affected;\
              \ and (4) presence of markers of severe inflammation, including crypt\
              \ abscesses, submucosal inflammation and edema. Scores for individual\
              \ criteria were added for an overall inflammation score of between zero\
              \ and 12 for each sample. Scores from mid and distal colon were then\
              \ averaged to obtain inflammation scores for each mouse colon.\\n\\\
              nMonocolonized, germ-free mice were euthanized 7 days after DSS administration\
              \ and samples taken from the cecum and midcolon. Tissue sections were\
              \ fixed in methacarn, paraffin embedded, sectioned and stained with\
              \ H&E. Colon and cecum histopathology was graded on a semiquantitative\
              \ scale by a pathologist blinded to the groups. The criteria scored\
              \ were (1) degree of epithelial hyperplasia/damage and goblet cell depletion;\
              \ (2) severity of leukocyte infiltration in lamina propria; (3) extent\
              \ of inflammation; and (4) presence of markers of severe inflammation,\
              \ including crypt abscesses, submucosal inflammation and edema. Each\
              \ criterion was scored on a scale of zero to three based on previously\
              \ described thresholds28 and the sum of the individual scores was recorded\
              \ as an indication of overall inflammation. For all animal experiments,\
              \ treatments were randomized by cage by researchers blinded to treatment\
              \ conditions. For statistical analysis, distribution was assumed to\
              \ be normal but this was not formally tested\\n\\n### Bacterial culture\\\

              n\\n### Metagenomic data analysis\\n\\nAnalysis of 16 S rRNA amplicon\
              \ sequences was performed with mothur MiSeq SOP v.1.42.3 using SILVA\
              \ v.132 (ref. 29). The 16 S rRNA gene alignments were used to determine\
              \ maximum likelihood phylogeny using FastTree v.2.1.10 (ref. 30). Phylogenetic\
              \ trees were visualized and edited using iTOL31. Shotgun metagenomic\
              \ reads were filtered for quality and adapter sequences using KneadData\
              \ v.0.7.3, with default settings. Host reads were removed from samples\
              \ using the GRCm39 reference genome and Bowtie2 v.2.3.5. In addition,\
              \ reads were aligned to the Phi X 174 genome and removed. Taxonomic\
              \ classification of metagenomic reads was performed using Kraken2 v.2.0.8\
              \ and a custom database built from the genomes of the Mouse Gut Bacterial\
              \ Catalog (MGBC).\\n\\nAll data analyses were performed in R v.4.0.2.\
              \ Species abundant at \u22650.01% reads were considered present in a\
              \ sample, and operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were considered statistically\
              \ different at P < 0.05. For shotgun metagenomic sequencing, relative\
              \ abundance of species was corrected using Bracken v.2.5.2. Bar plots\
              \ for species prevalence data and sample numbers were generated using\
              \ the ggplot2 v.3.3.3 package. To quantify and visualize intrainstitute\
              \ abundance, species abundance data for each sample underwent Bayesian\
              \ multiplicative replacement of zero counts using the zCompositions\
              \ v.1.3.4 package, and the data transformed using center log-ratio normalization.\
              \ Mean abundance per sample was then calculated and visualized using\
              \ the pheatmap v.1.0.12 package. Principal component analyses were performed\
              \ in R, and linear regression analysis was performed using the linear\
              \ regression function in python scikit-learn v.0.20.4. Alpha diversity\
              \ was assessed using Vegan v.2.5.6 (ref. 30). Correlation analysis was\
              \ performed using Spearman\u2019s rank correlation coefficient.\\n\\\
              n### Curation of public metagenome samples\\n\\nTo assess the abundance\
              \ of both health- and disease-associated bacteria in mice from different\
              \ institutes, we curated publicly available fecal shotgun metagenomes\
              \ for healthy, control SPF mice from NCBI and ENA. These samples included\
              \ mice from different genetic backgrounds and strains, but samples were\
              \ excluded if mice were younger than 3 weeks, had received antimicrobial\
              \ treatment or dietary intervention or had gene knockout. In total 582\
              \ fecal shotgun metagenomes were curated.\\n\\n### qPCR of bacterial\
              \ load\\n\\nAnaerostipes faecis and D. muricolitica were quantified\
              \ in the feces of SPF mice using qPCR with custom primers. Primers were\
              \ designed using the taxon-linked gene catalog of MGBC32. Briefly, we\
              \ identified gene targets that were both unique to, and highly conserved\
              \ in, the genome of each species. To ensure target specificity, we selected\
              \ gene clusters that shared <50% sequence identity with all nontarget\
              \ species sequences. Gene targets were defined as highly conserved if\
              \ they were identified in 100% of high-quality target species genomes\
              \ in the MGBC. Furthermore, only single-copy-number gene targets were\
              \ considered. Sequences for selected gene products were then clustered\
              \ at 90% sequence identity and used as templates for design of PCR primers\
              \ with NCBI Primer-BLAST33, ensuring specificity against the NCBI nonredundant\
              \ gene catalog. Two primers for each species were used in conjunction\
              \ for qPCR.\\n\\nPrimers: A14_1 (gene target: MGBC000029_00009), forward\

              \ from feces using FastDNA Spin Kit for Soil (MPBio) according to the\
              \ manufacturer\u2019s instructions, and DNA eluted into 100 \xB5l of\
              \ double-distilled H2O. Eluted DNA was then diluted 1:50 and qPCR performed\
              \ using SYBR Green chemistry (Thermo Fisher). To approximate the relative\
              \ abundance of target species in SPF feces, cycle threshold values were\
              \ normalized to those of a universal bacterial 16 S primer (F: 5'- GTGSTGCAYGGYTGTCGTCA-3';\
              \ R: 5'- ACGTCRTCCMCACCTTCCTC-3').\\n\\n### Intestinal immune cell isolation\\\
              n\\nLarge intestines were excised and separated from mesentery and fat.\
              \ Transluminal sections were taken from the cecum and distal colon for\
              \ histology. The intestines were opened longitudinally, cleared of feces\
              \ then washed three times in cold PBS. To isolate intraepithelial immune\
              \ populations, the large intestines were cut into 1-cm pieces, washed\
              \ in cold PBS then incubated in 10 ml of PBS + 1 mM dithiothreitol for\
              \ 10 min. Tissues were manually disrupted via shaking and then strained,\

              \ being shaken and strained. The supernatants from these two steps were\
              \ pooled, filtered at 70 \xB5m and the filtrate fractionated using a\
              \ discontinuous Percoll gradient (80/40%). Epithelial cells were isolated\
              \ from the surface of the Percoll, and intraepithelial immune cells\
              \ isolated from the interface.\\n\\nTo access the lamina propria compartment,\
              \ tissues were manually chopped and digested in HBSS + 25 mM HEPES +\

              \ (Sigma) and 50 \xB5g ml\u20131 DNase I (Sigma) for 1 h at 37 \xB0\
              C and 80 r.p.m. Samples were mechanically disrupted and filtered at\
              \ 70 \xB5m. The filtrate was fractionated using a discontinuous Percoll\
              \ gradient (80/40%). Lamina propria immune cells were isolated from\
              \ the interface.\\n\\n### Flow cytometry\\n\\nIntestinal and mesenteric\

              \ yet been characterized, nor have these names been validly published\
              \ according to the International Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes.\
              \ Because these species are uncharacterized, they are referred to as\
              \ previously undescribed in this manuscript. Phenotypic data for the\
              \ capacity of each species to utilize 95 substrates as sole carbon sources\
              \ were attained using the BioLog platform (see BioLog analysis for a\
              \ description of methodology). Isolated genomes were functionally annotated\
              \ using eggNOG-mapper v.2 and InterProScan v.5. We describe these species\
              \ and propose new names below.\\n\\n#### Description of \u2018Alistipes\
              \ okayasuensis\u2019 sp. nov\\n\\nAlistipes okayasuensis (o\u2019ka.ya.su.en.sis.\
              \ N.L. masc./fem. adj. okayasuensis) is named after Isao Okayasu, who\
              \ first described DSS colitis as a model for ulcerative colitis in mice.\
              \ Phylogenomic analyses place strain A61T in the Alistipes cluster.\
              \ The digital DNA\u2013DNA hybridization (dDDH) value between A. onderdonkii\
              \ and A. putredinis is 24.4%, while dDDH values between strain A61T,\
              \ A. onderdonkii and A. putredinis are 25.2 and 21.4%, respectively.\
              \ The G + C content difference between the genome of strain A61T and\
              \ A. onderdonkii, its closest phylogenomic neighbor, is 1.39%, while\
              \ their 16S rRNA gene sequence identity is 96.03%. These analyses strongly\
              \ indicate that \u2018Alistipes okayasuensis\u2019 is a separate species\
              \ within the genus Alistipes.\\n\\nThis strain is a strict anaerobe.\
              \ Carbon source utilization analysis was combined with reconstruction\
              \ of Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) metabolic pathways\
              \ (55.58% of 2,022 predicted open reading frames (ORFs) could be annotated)\
              \ to functionally characterize the strain. The strain encodes 47 genes\
              \ predicted to be carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes), including 29\
              \ glycoside hydrolases: seven beta-glucosidases (GH3, EC 3.2.1.21);\
              \ five beta-galactosidases (EC 3.2.1.23); five endohydrolytic alpha-glucosidases\
              \ (GH13), including four alpha-amylases (EC 3.2.1.1); three exohydrolytic\
              \ alpha-glucosidases (GH31, EC 3.2.1.20); three cellulases (EC 3.2.1.4);\
              \ three mannan endo-1,4-beta-mannosidases (EC 3.2.1.78); and an alpha-l-fucosidase\
              \ (EC 3.2.1.51). Despite this predicted hydrolytic potential, the strain\
              \ shows limited capacity to utilize disaccharides and oligosaccharides\
              \ as sole carbon sources. While the strain tested positive for utilization\
              \ of alpha-d-lactose, sucrose and maltotriose, it tested negative for\
              \ utilization of d-cellobiose, dextrin, cyclodextrin, gentiobiose, lactulose,\
              \ maltose, d-melezitose, d-melibiose, palatinose, d-raffinose, stachyose,\
              \ d-trehalose, fucose or turanose.\\n\\nThe strain is predicted to encode\
              \ enzymes for metabolism of l-histidine to l-glutamate via 4-Imidazolone-5-phsophate\
              \ (EC 4.3.1.3, EC 4.2.1.49, EC 3.5.2.7, EC 2.1.2.5). In support of these\
              \ predictions, the strain is capable of utilizing urocanate as a sole\
              \ carbon source. In keeping with other members of the genus Alistipes,\
              \ this strain is predicted to encode a putative tryptophanase (EC 4.1.99.1)\
              \ that would allow it to hydrolyze tryptophan to indole. The strain\
              \ is also predicted to encode a butyrate phosphotransferase (EC 2.3.1.19)\
              \ and a butyrate kinase (EC 2.7.2.7), indicating its potential to metabolize\
              \ butyrate. The genome is 2,329,524 bp with a G + C content of 56.45\
              \ mol%. We propose the name \u2018Alistipes okayasuensis\u2019 for this\
              \ previously undescribed species, in reference to the origins of the\
              \ DSS colitis model and reflecting this species\u2019 association with\
              \ poor outcomes of this disease model. The type strain is A61T (=CCUG\
              \ 75087T =SM 112987T).\\n\\n#### Description of \u2018Anaerostipes faecis\u2019\
              \ sp. nov\\n\\nAnaerostipes faecis (fae\u2019cis. L. gen. fem. n. faecis,\
              \ of feces, referring to fecal origin). The closest phylogenomic neighbor\
              \ of strain A14T is Anaerostipes caccae, with a dDDH value of 48.40%.\
              \ The pairwise 16 S rRNA gene sequence identity of A14T and A. caccae\
              \ DSM 14662T is 98.16%. These analyses indicate that A14T is a separate\
              \ species within the genus Anaerostipes. The genome is 3,200,246 bp\
              \ with a G + C content of 43.77 mol%. We propose the name \u2018Anaerostipes\
              \ faecis\u2019 for this new species. The type strain is A14T (=CCUG\
              \ 75084T).\\n\\nThe strain is strictly anaerobic. Reconstruction of\
              \ KEGG metabolic pathways (55.4% of 3,222 predicted ORFs could be annotated)\
              \ indicates that the strain can produce butyrate via a butyrate phosphotransferase/butyrate\
              \ kinase operon (EC 2.7.2.7, EC 2.3.1.91), in keeping with the genus\
              \ type species A. caccae. Likewise, the strain is predicted to encode\
              \ an arginine dihydrolase (EC 3.5.3.6). In contrast to the genus description,\
              \ however, this strain is predicted to encode neither an alpha-galactosidase\
              \ (EC 3.2.1.22) nor a phosphoamidase (EC 3.9.1.1).\\n\\nThe strain shows\
              \ limited capacity to utilize monosaccharides as sole carbon sources:\
              \ it had a robust phenotype for utilization of 3-methyl-d-glucose but\
              \ tested negative for its ability to utilize other monosaccharides including\
              \ d-fructose, d-galactose, d-mannose or d-glucose as sole carbon sources.\
              \ Notably, the strain is predicted to encode the complete Leloir pathway\
              \ for galactose metabolism, as well as multiple beta-galactosidases\
              \ (EC 3.2.1.23), indicating that it might lack a galactose transporter\
              \ but could metabolize galactose in different contexts such as downstream\
              \ of other pathways of carbohydrate metabolism. The strain can utilize\
              \ some disaccharides, testing positive for sucrose utilization, potentially\
              \ via multiple oligo-1,6-glucosidases (EC 3.2.1.10), d-trehalose utilization,\
              \ potentially via three trehalases (EC 3.2.1.28, GH37, GH65) and turanose\
              \ utilization. However, the strain tested negative for its ability to\
              \ utilize alpha-d-lactose, lactulose, maltose, d-melibiose, gentiobiose,\
              \ d-cellobiose or palatinose. Additionally, the strain tested negative\
              \ for utilization of the trisccharides maltotriose, d-melezitose and\
              \ d-raffinose and the tetrasaccharide stachyose\u2014potentially due\
              \ to the absence of a predicted alpha-galactosidase. The strain could\
              \ utilize beta-cyclodextrin, but tested negative for utilization of\
              \ dextrin and alpha-cyclodextrin. The strain is capable of utilizing\
              \ alpha-ketovaleric acid and d-malic acid, as well as certain amino\
              \ acids and derivatives including l-threonine, l-asparagine, l-serine\
              \ and the dipeptides glycyl-l-proline and l-alanyl-l-threonine. The\
              \ strain tested negative for utilization of l-glutamine, l-glutamate,\
              \ l-valine and l-alanine.\\n\\n#### Description of \u2018Duncaniella\

              \ are 95.14 and 93.00%, respectively, indicating that A60T is a separate\
              \ species within the Duncaniella cluster. The dDDH value between A60T\
              \ and D. dubosii H5T is 28.10%, confirming a separate species status.\\\
              n\\nRecent work benchmarking an average nucleotide identity1 approach\
              \ to define genus boundaries found that the genus inflection points\

              \ (EC: 3.2.1.22, EC: 3.2.1.20) rather than stachyose or melibiose. Additionally,\
              \ the strain tested negative for utilization of both stachyose and melibiose.\
              \ In our study the strain tested negative for an ability to utilize\
              \ lactose as a single carbon source, even though it encodes seven predicted\
              \ beta-galactosidases (EC 3.2.1.23). The strain is predicted to encode\
              \ 36 glycosyltransferase enzymes, among which are seven GT2 family enzymes\
              \ including two dolichyl-phosphate beta-d-mannosyltransferases (EC:\

              \ d-fructose, lactate, lactulose, d-trehalose or l-rhamnose as sole\
              \ carbon sources. The strain is predicted to encode the pathway for\
              \ metabolism of l-histidine to l-glutamate via 4-Imidazolone-5-phsophate\

              \ + C content of 50.9 mol%. Following functional and genomic characterization\
              \ of our isolate, we propose the name \u2018Duncaniella muricolitica\u2019\
              \ for this species in reference to its association with poor prognosis\

              \ the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.\\n\\\
              n## Mouse models\\n\\nMice were maintained under either germ-free or\
              \ SPF conditions at the Wellcome Sanger Institute Home Office-approved\
              \ facility, with all procedures carried out in accordance with the United\
              \ Kingdom Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act of 1986 under Home Office\
              \ approval (PPL no. 80/2643). Germ-free mice were maintained in positive-pressure\
              \ isolators (Bell), with feces tested by culture, microscopy and PCR\
              \ to ensure sterility. Consumables were autoclaved at 121 \xB0C for\
              \ 15 min before introduction into the isolators. For experimentation,\
              \ cages were opened in a vaporized hydrogen peroxide-sterilized, class\
              \ II cabinet (Bioquell), with fecal transplant and monocolonized gnotobiotic\
              \ lines generated by weekly oral gavage over a 3-week period. Materials\
              \ were prepared in Dulbecco\u2019s PBS at 100 mg ml\u20131 immediately\
              \ before administration under anaerobic conditions (10% H, 10% CO2,\
              \ 80% N) in a Whitley DG250 workstation at 37 \xB0C (ref. 8). Mice were\
              \ maintained in sterile ISOcages (Tecniplast) and housed on ISOrack\
              \ for the period of the experiment.\\n\\n## DSS colitis challenge\\\
              n\\nDextran sulphate sodium was administered at a concentration of 1.5%\
              \ (w/v) (Affymetrix, Inc., average molecular weight 44 kDa) in drinking\
              \ water for 7 days, followed by 3 days with regular drinking water,\
              \ to C57BL6/6N mice aged 7\u201316 weeks (297 male, 282 female; median\
              \ age 11 weeks; s.d. 12 days). Mice were weighed every day and culled\
              \ if weight loss reached 20% of starting weight. Average weight loss\
              \ curves were censored for each group when the first member of the group\
              \ reached this endpoint, to avoid misleading calculations of the average\
              \ using the remaining members. No statistical methods were used to predetermine\
              \ sample sizes in these experiments.\\n\\n## Histological assessment\
              \ of intestinal inflammation\\n\\nDextran sulphate sodium-treated SPF\
              \ mice were sacrificed at day 10 by cervical dislocation, and samples\
              \ from mid and distal colon taken. Tissue sections were fixed in buffered\
              \ 10% formalin, paraffin embedded, cut and stained with hematoxylin\
              \ and eosin (H&E). Colon histopathology was blind-graded semiquantitatively,\
              \ on a scale from zero to three, for four criteria: (1) degree of epithelial\
              \ hyperplasia/damage and goblet cell depletion; (2) leukocyte infiltration\
              \ in lamina propria; (3) area of tissue affected; and (4) presence of\
              \ markers of severe inflammation, including crypt abscesses, submucosal\
              \ inflammation and edema. Scores for individual criteria were added\
              \ for an overall inflammation score of between zero and 12 for each\
              \ sample. Scores from mid and distal colon were then averaged to obtain\
              \ inflammation scores for each mouse colon.\\n\\nMonocolonized, germ-free\
              \ mice were euthanized 7 days after DSS administration and samples taken\
              \ from the cecum and midcolon. Tissue sections were fixed in methacarn,\
              \ paraffin embedded, sectioned and stained with H&E. Colon and cecum\
              \ histopathology was graded on a semiquantitative scale by a pathologist\
              \ blinded to the groups. The criteria scored were (1) degree of epithelial\
              \ hyperplasia/damage and goblet cell depletion; (2) severity of leukocyte\
              \ infiltration in lamina propria; (3) extent of inflammation; and (4)\
              \ presence of markers of severe inflammation, including crypt abscesses,\
              \ submucosal inflammation and edema. Each criterion was scored on a\
              \ scale of zero to three based on previously described thresholds28\
              \ and the sum of the individual scores was recorded as an indication\
              \ of overall inflammation. For all animal experiments, treatments were\
              \ randomized by cage by researchers blinded to treatment conditions.\
              \ For statistical analysis, distribution was assumed to be normal but\
              \ this was not formally tested\\n\\n## Bacterial culture\\n\\nFecal\
              \ samples and bacterial isolates were cultured for anaerobic gastrointestinal\
              \ bacteria under anaerobic conditions (10% H, 10% CO2, 80% N) in a Whitley\
              \ DG250 workstation at 37 \xB0C (ref. 8). Fecal samples were homogenized\
              \ in reduced PBS (0.1 g ml\u20131 PBS), serially diluted and plated\
              \ directly onto YCFA agar supplemented with 0.002 g ml\u22121 each of\
              \ glucose, maltose and cellobiose. Colonies were picked, restreaked\
              \ to purity and identified using 16 S rRNA gene sequencing.\\n\\n##\
              \ Microbiota profiling and analysis\\n\\nFecal samples were collected\
              \ directly from mice and immediately stored at \u221280 \xB0C until\
              \ DNA extraction. DNA was extracted from samples using the FastDNA Spin\
              \ Kit for Soil (MPBio) and stored at \u221220 \xB0C until metagenomic\
              \ sequencing. DNA samples were quantified using a Qubit 4 Fluorometer\
              \ (Thermo Fisher). 16 S rRNA amplicon-based profiling was performed\
              \ using the FastDNA Spin Kit for Soil (MP Biomedicals) on 300 mg of\
              \ fecal sample from each mouse. The V1\u2013V2 region of 16 S rRNA genes\
              \ was amplified with a Q5 High-Fidelity Polymerase Kit (New England\
              \ Biolabs): F': AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACAC-TATGGTAATT-CC-AGMGTTYGATYMTGGCTCAG;\
              \ R': CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGATACGAGACTGATTAGTCAGTCAGAAGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAG.\
              \ Each PCR amplification was performed as four independent amplifications\
              \ and pooled in equimolar amounts for 150-base-paired (bp)-end sequencing\
              \ with the Illumina MiSeq platform. For shotgun metagenomic sequencing,\
              \ samples with >100 ng of DNA material were processed onward to paired-end\
              \ (2 \xD7 150 bp) metagenomics sequencing on the HiSeq 4000 platform\
              \ as per standard manufacturer library preparation and sequencing protocols.\\\
              n\\n## Metagenomic data analysis\\n\\nAnalysis of 16 S rRNA amplicon\
              \ sequences was performed with mothur MiSeq SOP v.1.42.3 using SILVA\
              \ v.132 (ref. 29). The 16 S rRNA gene alignments were used to determine\
              \ maximum likelihood phylogeny using FastTree v.2.1.10 (ref. 30). Phylogenetic\
              \ trees were visualized and edited using iTOL31. Shotgun metagenomic\
              \ reads were filtered for quality and adapter sequences using KneadData\
              \ v.0.7.3, with default settings. Host reads were removed from samples\
              \ using the GRCm39 reference genome and Bowtie2 v.2.3.5. In addition,\
              \ reads were aligned to the Phi X 174 genome and removed. Taxonomic\
              \ classification of metagenomic reads was performed using Kraken2 v.2.0.8\
              \ and a custom database built from the genomes of the Mouse Gut Bacterial\
              \ Catalog (MGBC).\\n\\nAll data analyses were performed in R v.4.0.2.\
              \ Species abundant at \u22650.01% reads were considered present in a\
              \ sample, and operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were considered statistically\
              \ different at P < 0.05. For shotgun metagenomic sequencing, relative\
              \ abundance of species was corrected using Bracken v.2.5.2. Bar plots\
              \ for species prevalence data and sample numbers were generated using\
              \ the ggplot2 v.3.3.3 package. To quantify and visualize intrainstitute\
              \ abundance, species abundance data for each sample underwent Bayesian\
              \ multiplicative replacement of zero counts using the zCompositions\
              \ v.1.3.4 package, and the data transformed using center log-ratio normalization.\
              \ Mean abundance per sample was then calculated and visualized using\
              \ the pheatmap v.1.0.12 package. Principal component analyses were performed\
              \ in R, and linear regression analysis was performed using the linear\
              \ regression function in python scikit-learn v.0.20.4. Alpha diversity\
              \ was assessed using Vegan v.2.5.6 (ref. 30). Correlation analysis was\
              \ performed using Spearman\u2019s rank correlation coefficient.\\n\\\

              \ of both health- and disease-associated bacteria in mice from different\
              \ institutes, we curated publicly available fecal shotgun metagenomes\
              \ for healthy, control SPF mice from NCBI and ENA. These samples included\
              \ mice from different genetic backgrounds and strains, but samples were\
              \ excluded if mice were younger than 3 weeks, had received antimicrobial\
              \ treatment or dietary intervention or had gene knockout. In total 582\
              \ fecal shotgun metagenomes were curated.\\n\\n## qPCR of bacterial\
              \ load\\n\\nAnaerostipes faecis and D. muricolitica were quantified\
              \ in the feces of SPF mice using qPCR with custom primers. Primers were\
              \ designed using the taxon-linked gene catalog of MGBC32. Briefly, we\
              \ identified gene targets that were both unique to, and highly conserved\

              \ okayasuensis\u2019 sp. nov\\n\\nAlistipes okayasuensis (o\u2019ka.ya.su.en.sis.\
              \ N.L. masc./fem. adj. okayasuensis) is named after Isao Okayasu, who\
              \ first described DSS colitis as a model for ulcerative colitis in mice.\
              \ Phylogenomic analyses place strain A61T in the Alistipes cluster.\
              \ The digital DNA\u2013DNA hybridization (dDDH) value between A. onderdonkii\
              \ and A. putredinis is 24.4%, while dDDH values between strain A61T,\
              \ A. onderdonkii and A. putredinis are 25.2 and 21.4%, respectively.\
              \ The G + C content difference between the genome of strain A61T and\
              \ A. onderdonkii, its closest phylogenomic neighbor, is 1.39%, while\
              \ their 16S rRNA gene sequence identity is 96.03%. These analyses strongly\
              \ indicate that \u2018Alistipes okayasuensis\u2019 is a separate species\
              \ within the genus Alistipes.\\n\\nThis strain is a strict anaerobe.\
              \ Carbon source utilization analysis was combined with reconstruction\
              \ of Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) metabolic pathways\
              \ (55.58% of 2,022 predicted open reading frames (ORFs) could be annotated)\
              \ to functionally characterize the strain. The strain encodes 47 genes\
              \ predicted to be carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes), including 29\
              \ glycoside hydrolases: seven beta-glucosidases (GH3, EC 3.2.1.21);\
              \ five beta-galactosidases (EC 3.2.1.23); five endohydrolytic alpha-glucosidases\
              \ (GH13), including four alpha-amylases (EC 3.2.1.1); three exohydrolytic\
              \ alpha-glucosidases (GH31, EC 3.2.1.20); three cellulases (EC 3.2.1.4);\
              \ three mannan endo-1,4-beta-mannosidases (EC 3.2.1.78); and an alpha-l-fucosidase\
              \ (EC 3.2.1.51). Despite this predicted hydrolytic potential, the strain\
              \ shows limited capacity to utilize disaccharides and oligosaccharides\
              \ as sole carbon sources. While the strain tested positive for utilization\
              \ of alpha-d-lactose, sucrose and maltotriose, it tested negative for\
              \ utilization of d-cellobiose, dextrin, cyclodextrin, gentiobiose, lactulose,\
              \ maltose, d-melezitose, d-melibiose, palatinose, d-raffinose, stachyose,\
              \ d-trehalose, fucose or turanose.\\n\\nThe strain is predicted to encode\
              \ enzymes for metabolism of l-histidine to l-glutamate via 4-Imidazolone-5-phsophate\
              \ (EC 4.3.1.3, EC 4.2.1.49, EC 3.5.2.7, EC 2.1.2.5). In support of these\
              \ predictions, the strain is capable of utilizing urocanate as a sole\
              \ carbon source. In keeping with other members of the genus Alistipes,\
              \ this strain is predicted to encode a putative tryptophanase (EC 4.1.99.1)\
              \ that would allow it to hydrolyze tryptophan to indole. The strain\
              \ is also predicted to encode a butyrate phosphotransferase (EC 2.3.1.19)\
              \ and a butyrate kinase (EC 2.7.2.7), indicating its potential to metabolize\
              \ butyrate. The genome is 2,329,524 bp with a G + C content of 56.45\
              \ mol%. We propose the name \u2018Alistipes okayasuensis\u2019 for this\
              \ previously undescribed species, in reference to the origins of the\
              \ DSS colitis model and reflecting this species\u2019 association with\
              \ poor outcomes of this disease model. The type strain is A61T (=CCUG\
              \ 75087T =SM 112987T).\\n\\n### Description of \u2018Anaerostipes faecis\u2019\
              \ sp. nov\\n\\nAnaerostipes faecis (fae\u2019cis. L. gen. fem. n. faecis,\
              \ of feces, referring to fecal origin). The closest phylogenomic neighbor\
              \ of strain A14T is Anaerostipes caccae, with a dDDH value of 48.40%.\
              \ The pairwise 16 S rRNA gene sequence identity of A14T and A. caccae\
              \ DSM 14662T is 98.16%. These analyses indicate that A14T is a separate\
              \ species within the genus Anaerostipes. The genome is 3,200,246 bp\
              \ with a G + C content of 43.77 mol%. We propose the name \u2018Anaerostipes\
              \ faecis\u2019 for this new species. The type strain is A14T (=CCUG\
              \ 75084T).\\n\\nThe strain is strictly anaerobic. Reconstruction of\
              \ KEGG metabolic pathways (55.4% of 3,222 predicted ORFs could be annotated)\
              \ indicates that the strain can produce butyrate via a butyrate phosphotransferase/butyrate\
              \ kinase operon (EC 2.7.2.7, EC 2.3.1.91), in keeping with the genus\
              \ type species A. caccae. Likewise, the strain is predicted to encode\
              \ an arginine dihydrolase (EC 3.5.3.6). In contrast to the genus description,\
              \ however, this strain is predicted to encode neither an alpha-galactosidase\
              \ (EC 3.2.1.22) nor a phosphoamidase (EC 3.9.1.1).\\n\\nThe strain shows\
              \ limited capacity to utilize monosaccharides as sole carbon sources:\
              \ it had a robust phenotype for utilization of 3-methyl-d-glucose but\
              \ tested negative for its ability to utilize other monosaccharides including\
              \ d-fructose, d-galactose, d-mannose or d-glucose as sole carbon sources.\
              \ Notably, the strain is predicted to encode the complete Leloir pathway\
              \ for galactose metabolism, as well as multiple beta-galactosidases\
              \ (EC 3.2.1.23), indicating that it might lack a galactose transporter\
              \ but could metabolize galactose in different contexts such as downstream\
              \ of other pathways of carbohydrate metabolism. The strain can utilize\
              \ some disaccharides, testing positive for sucrose utilization, potentially\
              \ via multiple oligo-1,6-glucosidases (EC 3.2.1.10), d-trehalose utilization,\
              \ potentially via three trehalases (EC 3.2.1.28, GH37, GH65) and turanose\
              \ utilization. However, the strain tested negative for its ability to\
              \ utilize alpha-d-lactose, lactulose, maltose, d-melibiose, gentiobiose,\
              \ d-cellobiose or palatinose. Additionally, the strain tested negative\
              \ for utilization of the trisccharides maltotriose, d-melezitose and\
              \ d-raffinose and the tetrasaccharide stachyose\u2014potentially due\
              \ to the absence of a predicted alpha-galactosidase. The strain could\
              \ utilize beta-cyclodextrin, but tested negative for utilization of\
              \ dextrin and alpha-cyclodextrin. The strain is capable of utilizing\
              \ alpha-ketovaleric acid and d-malic acid, as well as certain amino\
              \ acids and derivatives including l-threonine, l-asparagine, l-serine\
              \ and the dipeptides glycyl-l-proline and l-alanyl-l-threonine. The\
              \ strain tested negative for utilization of l-glutamine, l-glutamate,\
              \ l-valine and l-alanine.\\n\\n### Description of \u2018Duncaniella\

              \ and D. dubosii H5T is 28.10%, confirming a separate species status.\\\
              n\\nRecent work benchmarking an average nucleotide identity1 approach\

              \ that A60T belongs to the genus Duncaniella.\\n\\nThe strain is an\

              \ is enriched for enzymes with glycoside hydrolase activity, encoding\
              \ 47 in total. The strain is able to utilize dextrin, beta-cyclodextrin\

              \ (EC: 2.4.1.20; EC: 3.2.1.21). The strain is capable of utilizing d-raffinose,\

              \ (EC: 3.2.1.22, EC: 3.2.1.20) rather than stachyose or melibiose. Additionally,\
              \ the strain tested negative for utilization of both stachyose and melibiose.\

              \ KEGG metabolic pathways (55.4% of 3,222 predicted ORFs could be annotated)\

              \ d-fructose, d-galactose, d-mannose or d-glucose as sole carbon sources.\
              \ Notably, the strain is predicted to encode the complete Leloir pathway\
              \ for galactose metabolism, as well as multiple beta-galactosidases\
              \ (EC 3.2.1.23), indicating that it might lack a galactose transporter\
              \ but could metabolize galactose in different contexts such as downstream\
              \ of other pathways of carbohydrate metabolism. The strain can utilize\

              \ identically housed, SPF wild-type C57BL/6N mice (297 males, 282 females;\
              \ median age 11 weeks; s.d. 12 days) from 14 distinct parental lineages\
              \ (that is, founder matings derived from a single breeding pair). We\
              \ observed extensive variability in experimental endpoints in these\
              \ genetically identical mice at 10 days post DSS treatment, with histological\
              \ assessment of intestinal pathology of the mid and distal colon ranging\
              \ from severe inflammation, characterized by extensive crypt loss, leukocytic\
              \ infiltration and edema, to no visible inflammation (Fig. 1a,b). Substantial\
              \ variation was also observed in the weight change of mice treated with\
              \ DSS, with the response ranging from 12% weight gain to 30% weight\
              \ loss across the cohort (Fig. 1c). Regression analysis considering\

              \ may be partially independent responses to DSS (Fig. 1d). This relationship\

              \ factors determining disease outcome, we established a random forest\

              \ room and experimental date to assess the relative importance of each\
              \ of these factors (Extended Data Fig. 1). The strongest predictive\

              \ in these genetically identical C57BL/6N mice maintained under standardized\

              \ correlation analysis confirming these associations (P < 0.01, Kruskal\u2013\
              Wallis; Extended Data Fig. 1).Since all mice were derived from the same\
              \ genetic founder stock, the most likely mediator of their DSS phenotype\
              \ was an extrinsic lineage-specific factor. However, to exclude the\
              \ role of host genetics or epigenetic differences between colonies,\
              \ and to determine whether the microbiota alone could be responsible\
              \ for the observed phenotypic variation, fecal samples were collected\
              \ from SPF mice (without DSS treatment) from parental lineages that\
              \ represented extremes of disease outcome and were used to colonize\
              \ C57BL/6N germ-free mice. These colonized recipient mice were then\
              \ subjected to DSS treatment involving daily weight measurements, with\
              \ colon sections collected and analyzed histologically 10 days after\
              \ the initiation of DSS treatment. Recipient mice exhibited both weight\
              \ loss and pathology scores not statistically different from those observed\

              \ between disease- and non-associated lineages (P = 0.0002, paired t-test;\
              \ Fig. 2a). From these results it is clear that, independent of other\
              \ factors such as host genetics or epigenetic lineage-specific factors,\
              \ the microbiota is sufficient to produce the observed variation in\

              \ disease variabilityHaving established the importance of the microbiota\
              \ in mediation of phenotypic outcomes to DSS in genetically identical\
              \ mice, we next sought to understand the degree of variability in the\
              \ mouse microbiota across a single facility, and to define changes in\
              \ the microbiota that occur with DSS treatment. Fecal samples were collected\
              \ before DSS treatment and 10 days after DSS exposure, and subjected\
              \ to taxonomic profiling with 16 S ribosomal RNA amplicon sequencing\
              \ to determine microbiota community composition. Consistent with previous\
              \ reports of gastrointestinal inflammation, this analysis demonstrated\
              \ a clear separation of microbiome community between pre- and post-DSS\
              \ samples (Fig. 2b,c and Extended Data Figs. 2 and 3) and a significant\
              \ reduction in bacterial diversity (Shannon diversity index, P = 0.0357;\
              \ Fig. 2d)12. Although expansion of Proteobacteria is often associated\
              \ with gut microbiome dysbiosis, while an increase in Proteobacteria\
              \ was observed post DSS (P < 0.05, Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test), limited\
              \ association was observed between weight loss and Proteobacteria proportion\
              \ either pre (Fig. 2e; Spearman correlation, 0.196) or post DSS treatment\
              \ (Fig. 2e; Spearman correlation, \u22120.289). This suggests that other\
              \ gut bacteria may be contributing to the observed variation in DSS\
              \ resistance and susceptibility.Given the transmissibility of disease\
              \ phenotype we observed in the germ-free mouse experiments, we reasoned\
              \ that the observed phenotypic variation was primarily dependent on\
              \ baseline microbiota composition before DSS treatment. To understand\
              \ the composition of microbiota associated with increased risk of disease\
              \ outcome, we applied linear discriminant analysis to gut microbiota\
              \ composition before and after DSS exposure24. This unsupervised analysis\
              \ leveraged the variability between mouse lineage-specific bacteria\
              \ to identify the bacterial taxa that most closely predict DSS response.\
              \ Using this approach, we identified two statistically different bacterial\
              \ taxa associated with no disease, and five statistically different\
              \ bacterial taxa associated with >5% weight loss. Notably, no relationship\
              \ was observed between the occurrence or abundance of these isolates\
              \ in mice before DSS exposure, and equivalent predictive bacterial taxa\
              \ were not identified within the microbiota of mice after DSS exposure.\
              \ Our results suggest that the presence of specific gut bacterial taxa\
              \ before DSS exposure may influence disease severity and outcome, possibly\
              \ by either priming or protection from disease.Isolation of bacterial\
              \ species for functional validationWhile we show clear associations\
              \ between specific bacterial taxa and DSS-mediated disease outcome using\
              \ 16 S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing, accurate taxonomic identification\
              \ to strain level and experimental validation require the isolation\
              \ and genome sequencing of pure clonal cultures of bacterial strains.\
              \ To target and purify bacterial strains, we next performed broad-based\
              \ culture of ~2,000 bacterial colonies from mouse fecal samples. The\
              \ resulting isolates were identified by capillary 16 S rRNA gene sequencing\
              \ and included four previously identified bacterial taxa, two \u2018\
              disease associated\u2019 and two \u2018health associated\u2019. These\
              \ isolates were subjected to whole-genome sequencing and genomic analysis\
              \ to aid in precise taxonomic and phylogenetic assignment (Extended\
              \ Data Fig. 4). In addition, we performed extensive phenotypic characterization\
              \ and comparative genome analyses of these four species (Methods) as\
              \ a basis to provisionally name the health-associated bacteria Anaerostipes\
              \ faecis and Sangeribacter muris and the disease-associated bacteria\
              \ Duncaniella muricolitica and Alistipes okayasuensis; of note, the\
              \ last three species are mouse specific. Examination of the relative\
              \ abundance of each of these species before DSS treatment identified\
              \ significantly higher levels of A. faecis (P = 0264, t-test) and S.\
              \ muris (P = 0.0010, t-test) in those mice without weight loss, and\
              \ significantly higher levels of D. muricolitica (P = 0.0351, t-test)\
              \ and A. okayasuensis (P = 0.0006, t-test) in mice that experienced\
              \ >5% weight loss (Fig. 2f).We next repeated the DSS experimental model\
              \ in either germ-free mice or germ-free mice stably monocolonized for\
              \ 4 weeks with one of these four bacterial strains (Extended Data Figs.\
              \ 5a and 6). Control germ-free mice treated with DSS neither lost weight\
              \ (Fig. 3a) nor experienced mortality (Fig. 3b) over the course of the\
              \ experiment, suggesting that the presence of gut bacteria is important\
              \ in triggering overt disease in our facility. Comparable experimental\
              \ outcomes were observed in DSS-treated, germ-free mice monocolonized\
              \ with either of the health-associated bacteria, which did not lose\
              \ weight or develop intestinal pathology (Fig. 3a) nor experienced significant\
              \ mortality (Fig. 3b). In contrast, when DSS-treated mice were monocolonized\
              \ with either of the disease-associated bacteria, we observed more rapid\
              \ and greater weight loss (Fig. 3a) and significantly reduced survival\
              \ (Fig. 3b). Therefore, we identified and validated D. muricolitica\
              \ and A. okayasuensis as mouse bacteria that can promote disease not\
              \ observed in mice monocolonized with the commensal bacteria S. muris\
              \ and A. faecis.Fig. 3Phenotypic analysis of mice monocolonized with\

              \ dataTo understand inflammatory immune responses in the intestine potentially\
              \ caused by disease-associated versus health-associated species, we\
              \ next examined histology, immune cell populations and cytokine production.\
              \ The human-colonizing A. faecis and the facility-prevalent D. muricolitica\
              \ were chosen as exemplary disease- and health-associated bacteria,\
              \ respectively, for these analyses. Flow cytometric analysis of intestinal\
              \ lamina propria leukocytes isolated from germ-free mice monocolonized\
              \ for 4 weeks with either A. faecis or D. muricolitica revealed that\
              \ colonization with either strain did not significantly impact the composition\
              \ of intestinal leukocyte and lymphocyte subsets (Extended Data Figs.\
              \ 5b,c and 6). However, the perturbation and epithelial disruption induced\
              \ by DSS led to significantly increased inflammatory CD64+CD11c+ monocytes/macrophages\
              \ in the lamina propria compartment of the large intestine in D. muricolitica\
              \ monocolonized mice, but not in A. faecis monocolonized mice (Extended\
              \ Data Figs. 5c,d and 6). These monocytes have been shown to play a\
              \ pathogenic role in the intestine in the context of Helicobacter-induced\
              \ inflammation25. This suggests that, although neither pathogenic nor\
              \ immunogenic at homeostasis, D. muricolitica drives increased inflammatory\
              \ responses in the wake of epithelial damage whereas health-associated\
              \ A. faecis does not. Importantly, while histological samples taken\
              \ after 7 days of DSS treatment from colons and caeca of D. muricolitica\
              \ monocolonized mice occasionally exhibited features of severe inflammation,\
              \ this was not statistically different from that of A. faecis monocolonized\
              \ mice (Fig. 3c,d) and did not consistently correspond to the weight\
              \ loss observed. This again suggests that weight loss in the DSS model\
              \ may not always correlate with intestinal inflammation and pathology.To\
              \ determine whether the presence of D. muricolitica or A. faecis had\
              \ a positive or negative correlation with weight change, we next examined\
              \ 20 independent mice and assessed the relationship between bacterial\
              \ levels using quantitative PCR (qPCR) before DSS treatment and weight\
              \ change observed at day 10. This analysis identified a positive correlation\
              \ between weight change and pre-DSS A. faecis abundance (R = 0.3679,\
              \ P = 0.0046; Fig. 3e). Similarly, a negative correlation was observed\
              \ between weight change and D. muricolitica abundance (R2 = 0.3626,\
              \ P = 0.0050; Fig. 3e). This independent confirmation provides further\
              \ validation of the relationship between these species and the severity\
              \ of DSS colitis; however, additional work is needed to confirm their\
              \ roles as pathobionts.Global distribution and prevalence in other mouse\
              \ facilitiesBecause D. muricolitica and A. okayasuensis affected the\
              \ outcome of DSS colitis in our mouse facility, we next explored the\
              \ presence and distribution of these bacteria in other mouse facilities\
              \ around the world. To do so, we first generated a global representation\
              \ of laboratory mouse intestinal microbiomes by curating 582 publicly\
              \ available shotgun metagenome samples from \u2018control\u2019, SPF\
              \ mice. We combined this dataset with shotgun metagenomes from feces\
              \ of 40 mice at the Wellcome Sanger Institute to yield a global mouse\
              \ gut microbiome dataset covering 31 institutes across 12 countries.\
              \ We then determined the prevalence and abundance of health-associated\
              \ bacteria S. muris and A. faecis and disease-associated bacteria D.\
              \ muricolitica and A. okayasuensis in this mouse microbiome dataset.Duncaniella\
              \ muricolitica and A. okayasuensis were both dominant members of the\
              \ mouse microbiome, present in 54.5 and 47.9% of samples and with a\
              \ mean abundance of 0.52 and 0.48% reads per sample, respectively. Importantly,\
              \ D. muricolitica and A. okayasuensis were each detected in 80.6% (25/31)\
              \ of the institutes included in the analyses (Fig. 4), and there were\
              \ only three institutes that did not contain either of these species.\
              \ For comparison, among health-associated species S. muris was the most\
              \ dominant in the mouse gut microbiota, present in 96.5% of samples\
              \ with a mean abundance of 6.2% reads, while A. faecis was a relatively\
              \ minor species, present in 5.9% of samples with a mean abundance of\
              \ 0.22% reads. S. muris was present in all (31/31) of the institutes\
              \ included in the analyses, whereas A. faecis was detected in 25.8%\
              \ (8/31). The abundance of each species also differed between institutes\
              \ (Fig. 4). Thus, we show that mouse-derived bacteria cultured from\
              \ our institute are common mouse symbionts and, importantly, D. muricolitica\
              \ and A. okayasuensis are common, but not ubiquitous, in animal facilities\

              :\"DiscussionDespite experimental variability in the DSS mouse model,\
              \ which limits the interpretation and translation of data, the model\
              \ is increasingly used in basic research (>6,000 DSS model publications\
              \ on PubMed) and by the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries.\
              \ Cohousing, heterozygote mating and other experimental procedures have\
              \ been used in an attempt to normalize the microbiota within experiments\
              \ and ensure direct measures of the effects of mouse genetic background\
              \ on disease phenotype rather than indirect and unknown microbiota-associated\
              \ effects26. In our approach we leveraged this variability in DSS outcome,\
              \ in combination with microbiome analysis, machine learning, anerobic\
              \ culturing and germ-free mouse validation experiments, to gain relevant\
              \ biological insight into microbiota determinants of DSS disease. While\
              \ this consideration of the microbiome did not completely eliminate\
              \ the impact of multidimensionality in the DSS model, we identified\
              \ and undertook experimental validation of D. muricolitica and A. okayasuensis,\
              \ both of which have a dominant effect on DSS outcome.Interestingly,\
              \ D. muricolitica and A. okayasuensis are phylogenetically distinct\
              \ from each other and neither had computationally predicted virulence\
              \ factors within their genome. While it remains unclear how these isolates\
              \ contribute to DSS disease, both exhibit a potential for polysaccharide\
              \ utilization that may mediate this relationship through interaction\
              \ with the mucus layer. We also noted that weight loss and intestinal\
              \ pathology do not always correlate, so they should not necessarily\
              \ be used as surrogates for each other. Similarly, substantial weight\
              \ loss was observed in monocolonized mice even in the absence of severe\
              \ inflammation, suggesting that activation of key pathways alone can\
              \ have a substantial impact on experimental outcome. Together, these\
              \ insights raise the need for further experimental study of host interactions\
              \ and the biology of these important mouse-specific bacteria.We propose\
              \ that researchers should consider monitoring for D. muricolitica and\
              \ A. okayasuensis in their mouse facilities, as is undertaken for other\
              \ immunophenotyped-affecting microbes such as segmented filamentous\
              \ bacteria27. In some cases, precolonization of animals with these bacteria,\
              \ if they are not present in the facility, may yield better experimental\
              \ control and increase confidence in this important and widely used\
              \ mouse model of human disease. Overall, our work suggests that the\
              \ application of metagenomics techniques to report microbiota composition,\
              \ in addition to the genetic and disease phenotypes being described,\
              \ should represent a standard minimum requirement for the DSS mouse\
              \ model. We have deposited the D. muricolitis, A. okayasuensis, S. muris\
              \ and A. faecis strains and genomes in public repositories to support\

              \ sp. novAlistipes okayasuensis (o\u2019ka.ya.su.en.sis. N.L. masc./fem.\
              \ adj. okayasuensis) is named after Isao Okayasu, who first described\
              \ DSS colitis as a model for ulcerative colitis in mice. Phylogenomic\
              \ analyses place strain A61T in the Alistipes cluster. The digital DNA\u2013\
              DNA hybridization (dDDH) value between A. onderdonkii and A. putredinis\
              \ is 24.4%, while dDDH values between strain A61T, A. onderdonkii and\
              \ A. putredinis are 25.2 and 21.4%, respectively. The G + C content\
              \ difference between the genome of strain A61T and A. onderdonkii, its\
              \ closest phylogenomic neighbor, is 1.39%, while their 16S rRNA gene\
              \ sequence identity is 96.03%. These analyses strongly indicate that\
              \ \u2018Alistipes okayasuensis\u2019 is a separate species within the\
              \ genus Alistipes.This strain is a strict anaerobe. Carbon source utilization\
              \ analysis was combined with reconstruction of Kyoto Encyclopedia of\
              \ Genes and Genomes (KEGG) metabolic pathways (55.58% of 2,022 predicted\
              \ open reading frames (ORFs) could be annotated) to functionally characterize\
              \ the strain. The strain encodes 47 genes predicted to be carbohydrate-active\
              \ enzymes (CAZymes), including 29 glycoside hydrolases: seven beta-glucosidases\
              \ (GH3, EC 3.2.1.21); five beta-galactosidases (EC 3.2.1.23); five endohydrolytic\
              \ alpha-glucosidases (GH13), including four alpha-amylases (EC 3.2.1.1);\
              \ three exohydrolytic alpha-glucosidases (GH31, EC 3.2.1.20); three\
              \ cellulases (EC 3.2.1.4); three mannan endo-1,4-beta-mannosidases (EC\
              \ 3.2.1.78); and an alpha-l-fucosidase (EC 3.2.1.51). Despite this predicted\
              \ hydrolytic potential, the strain shows limited capacity to utilize\
              \ disaccharides and oligosaccharides as sole carbon sources. While the\
              \ strain tested positive for utilization of alpha-d-lactose, sucrose\
              \ and maltotriose, it tested negative for utilization of d-cellobiose,\
              \ dextrin, cyclodextrin, gentiobiose, lactulose, maltose, d-melezitose,\
              \ d-melibiose, palatinose, d-raffinose, stachyose, d-trehalose, fucose\
              \ or turanose.The strain is predicted to encode enzymes for metabolism\
              \ of l-histidine to l-glutamate via 4-Imidazolone-5-phsophate (EC 4.3.1.3,\
              \ EC 4.2.1.49, EC 3.5.2.7, EC 2.1.2.5). In support of these predictions,\
              \ the strain is capable of utilizing urocanate as a sole carbon source.\
              \ In keeping with other members of the genus Alistipes, this strain\
              \ is predicted to encode a putative tryptophanase (EC 4.1.99.1) that\
              \ would allow it to hydrolyze tryptophan to indole. The strain is also\
              \ predicted to encode a butyrate phosphotransferase (EC 2.3.1.19) and\
              \ a butyrate kinase (EC 2.7.2.7), indicating its potential to metabolize\
              \ butyrate. The genome is 2,329,524 bp with a G + C content of 56.45\
              \ mol%. We propose the name \u2018Alistipes okayasuensis\u2019 for this\
              \ previously undescribed species, in reference to the origins of the\
              \ DSS colitis model and reflecting this species\u2019 association with\
              \ poor outcomes of this disease model. The type strain is A61T (=CCUG\
              \ 75087T =SM 112987T).Description of \u2018Anaerostipes faecis\u2019\

              \ of strain A14T is Anaerostipes caccae, with a dDDH value of 48.40%.\
              \ The pairwise 16 S rRNA gene sequence identity of A14T and A. caccae\
              \ DSM 14662T is 98.16%. These analyses indicate that A14T is a separate\
              \ species within the genus Anaerostipes. The genome is 3,200,246 bp\
              \ with a G + C content of 43.77 mol%. We propose the name \u2018Anaerostipes\
              \ faecis\u2019 for this new species. The type strain is A14T (=CCUG\
              \ 75084T).The strain is strictly anaerobic. Reconstruction of KEGG metabolic\
              \ pathways (55.4% of 3,222 predicted ORFs could be annotated) indicates\
              \ that the strain can produce butyrate via a butyrate phosphotransferase/butyrate\
              \ kinase operon (EC 2.7.2.7, EC 2.3.1.91), in keeping with the genus\
              \ type species A. caccae. Likewise, the strain is predicted to encode\
              \ an arginine dihydrolase (EC 3.5.3.6). In contrast to the genus description,\
              \ however, this strain is predicted to encode neither an alpha-galactosidase\
              \ (EC 3.2.1.22) nor a phosphoamidase (EC 3.9.1.1).The strain shows limited\
              \ capacity to utilize monosaccharides as sole carbon sources: it had\
              \ a robust phenotype for utilization of 3-methyl-d-glucose but tested\
              \ negative for its ability to utilize other monosaccharides including\
              \ d-fructose, d-galactose, d-mannose or d-glucose as sole carbon sources.\
              \ Notably, the strain is predicted to encode the complete Leloir pathway\
              \ for galactose metabolism, as well as multiple beta-galactosidases\
              \ (EC 3.2.1.23), indicating that it might lack a galactose transporter\
              \ but could metabolize galactose in different contexts such as downstream\
              \ of other pathways of carbohydrate metabolism. The strain can utilize\
              \ some disaccharides, testing positive for sucrose utilization, potentially\
              \ via multiple oligo-1,6-glucosidases (EC 3.2.1.10), d-trehalose utilization,\
              \ potentially via three trehalases (EC 3.2.1.28, GH37, GH65) and turanose\
              \ utilization. However, the strain tested negative for its ability to\
              \ utilize alpha-d-lactose, lactulose, maltose, d-melibiose, gentiobiose,\
              \ d-cellobiose or palatinose. Additionally, the strain tested negative\
              \ for utilization of the trisccharides maltotriose, d-melezitose and\
              \ d-raffinose and the tetrasaccharide stachyose\u2014potentially due\
              \ to the absence of a predicted alpha-galactosidase. The strain could\
              \ utilize beta-cyclodextrin, but tested negative for utilization of\
              \ dextrin and alpha-cyclodextrin. The strain is capable of utilizing\
              \ alpha-ketovaleric acid and d-malic acid, as well as certain amino\
              \ acids and derivatives including l-threonine, l-asparagine, l-serine\
              \ and the dipeptides glycyl-l-proline and l-alanyl-l-threonine. The\
              \ strain tested negative for utilization of l-glutamine, l-glutamate,\

              \ (EC: 2.4.1.20; EC: 3.2.1.21). The strain is capable of utilizing d-raffinose,\

              \ (EC: 3.2.1.22, EC: 3.2.1.20) rather than stachyose or melibiose. Additionally,\

        n\\nExperimental mouse models are central to basic biomedical research; however,\
        \ variability exists across genetically identical mice and mouse facilities\
        \ making comparisons difficult. Whether specific indigenous gut bacteria drive\
        \ immunophenotypic variability in mouse models of human disease remains poorly\
        \ understood. We performed a large-scale experiment using 579 genetically\
        \ identical laboratory mice from a single animal facility, designed to identify\
        \ the causes of disease variability in the widely used dextran sulphate sodium\
        \ mouse model of inflammatory bowel disease. Commonly used treatment endpoint\
        \ measures\u2014weight loss and intestinal pathology\u2014showed limited correlation\
        \ and varied across mouse lineages. Analysis of the gut microbiome, coupled\
        \ with machine learning and targeted anaerobic culturing, identified and isolated\
        \ two previously undescribed species, Duncaniella muricolitica and Alistipes\
        \ okayasuensis, and demonstrated that they exert dominant effects in the dextran\
        \ sulphate sodium model leading to variable treatment endpoint measures. We\
        \ show that the identified gut microbial species are common, but not ubiquitous,\
        \ in mouse facilities around the world, and suggest that researchers monitor\
        \ for these species to provide experimental design opportunities for improved\
        \ mouse models of human intestinal diseases.\\n\\n## Main\\n\\nExperimental\
        \ mouse models are central to basic biomedical research and serve as important\
        \ preclinical models in drug discovery for a variety of human diseases, including\
        \ autoimmune and metabolic disorders, cancers and infections. Unfortunately,\
        \ there is tremendous variability in disease penetrance and reproducibility\
        \ among genetically identical mice within and between mouse facilities, limiting\
        \ the utility of many commonly used models1\u20133. Specific-pathogen-free\
        \ (SPF) protocols have been successfully employed to control the confounding\
        \ effects that can be caused by known bacterial pathogens, but we lack equivalent\
        \ knowledge of the effects of the diverse, uncharacterized symbiotic bacteria\
        \ within the indigenous gut microbiota of mice. While our knowledge of the\
        \ human gut microbiota in health and disease has expanded extensively with\
        \ large-scale microbiome studies, comprehensive computational bacterial discovery4,5\
        \ and extensive genome-sequenced bacterial collections6\u20139, equivalent\
        \ investigations in mouse models have remained limited. The vast differences\
        \ in species type, composition and dispersal between human and mouse microbiotas\
        \ highlight the importance of efforts to culture mouse-specific bacteria and\
        \ to validate their functions during intestinal homeostasis and disease10,11.\\\
        n\\nInflammatory bowel disease (IBD) research relies heavily on laboratory\
        \ mice to understand colitis and the role of host genetics in disease resistance\
        \ and susceptibility. Detailed immune characterization shows colitis induction\
        \ with specific microbial communities12 or species colonization with Helicobacter\
        \ spp.13,14, Enterobacteriaceae15, Bilophila wadsworthia16 or segmented filamentous\
        \ bacteria17. Potential genetic modulators of IBD are routinely assessed through\
        \ administration of dextran sulphate sodium (DSS) at various concentrations\
        \ in drinking water, which acts by damaging the gut epithelial barrier to\
        \ trigger inflammatory disease12,13. In germ-free mice, immune-mediated colitis\
        \ is largely absent although reduced barrier function can introduce susceptibility\
        \ at higher DSS concentrations18. Similarly, dietary changes in both germ-free\
        \ and SPF mice can determine DSS susceptibility in a microbiome-dependent\
        \ and -independent manner19, and highly specific protection is provided by\
        \ the presence of Clostridium immunis20\u201323. Despite these advances, the\
        \ gut microbiota in these mouse models, including standard SPF models, is\
        \ rarely profiled at the genomic level or cultured in the laboratory, nor\
        \ robustly controlled to understand the contribution of general gut bacteria\
        \ to experimental outcomes.\\n\\nTo quantify the variability of the widely\
        \ used DSS model of IBD and to investigate primary factors contributing to\
        \ this variability, we undertook a large-scale experiment using 579 genetically\
        \ identical laboratory mice in a single animal facility. Incorporating standardized\
        \ phenotyping, microbiome analysis and metadata collection, this approach\
        \ was designed to identify and validate the causes of variability for standard\
        \ experimental endpoints (weight loss and intestinal pathology). Using a data-driven\
        \ approach we identified, from gut microbiome data, candidate bacterial taxa\
        \ driving weight loss and intestinal inflammation. Functional validation with\
        \ cultured isolates suggests that these specific bacterial strains can determine\
        \ experimental outcomes in gnotobiotic mice. Thus, using an experimental approach\
        \ for microbiome discovery, we identified the previously undescribed mouse\
        \ gut bacteria Duncaniella muricolitica and Alistipes okayasuensis, found\
        \ frequently in mouse colonies around the world, that impact outcomes in the\

        \ administered 1.5% DSS through the drinking water for 7 days to 579 identically\
        \ housed, SPF wild-type C57BL/6N mice (297 males, 282 females; median age\
        \ 11 weeks; s.d. 12 days) from 14 distinct parental lineages (that is, founder\
        \ matings derived from a single breeding pair). We observed extensive variability\
        \ in experimental endpoints in these genetically identical mice at 10 days\
        \ post DSS treatment, with histological assessment of intestinal pathology\
        \ of the mid and distal colon ranging from severe inflammation, characterized\
        \ by extensive crypt loss, leukocytic infiltration and edema, to no visible\
        \ inflammation (Fig. 1a,b). Substantial variation was also observed in the\
        \ weight change of mice treated with DSS, with the response ranging from 12%\
        \ weight gain to 30% weight loss across the cohort (Fig. 1c). Regression analysis\
        \ considering histology scores and weight loss demonstrated limited correlation\
        \ (R2 = 0.27), suggesting that weight loss and intestinal pathology outcomes,\
        \ common experimental endpoint measures in the DSS model, may be partially\
        \ independent responses to DSS (Fig. 1d). This relationship is consistent\
        \ with systemic complications contributing to experimental endpoints in the\

        \ to DSS\\n\\nTo identify the primary factors determining disease outcome,\
        \ we established a random forest classifier model incorporating mouse sex,\
        \ age, lineage, parents, mouse room and experimental date to assess the relative\
        \ importance of each of these factors (Extended Data Fig. 1). The strongest\
        \ predictive factor for weight loss and histology score, both together and\
        \ independently in these genetically identical C57BL/6N mice maintained under\
        \ standardized SPF conditions within the same facility, was parental lineage,\
        \ with correlation analysis confirming these associations (P < 0.01, Kruskal\u2013\
        Wallis; Extended Data Fig. 1).\\n\\nSince all mice were derived from the same\
        \ genetic founder stock, the most likely mediator of their DSS phenotype was\
        \ an extrinsic lineage-specific factor. However, to exclude the role of host\
        \ genetics or epigenetic differences between colonies, and to determine whether\
        \ the microbiota alone could be responsible for the observed phenotypic variation,\
        \ fecal samples were collected from SPF mice (without DSS treatment) from\
        \ parental lineages that represented extremes of disease outcome and were\
        \ used to colonize C57BL/6N germ-free mice. These colonized recipient mice\
        \ were then subjected to DSS treatment involving daily weight measurements,\
        \ with colon sections collected and analyzed histologically 10 days after\
        \ the initiation of DSS treatment. Recipient mice exhibited both weight loss\
        \ and pathology scores not statistically different from those observed in\
        \ the respective donor mouse lineages, but differing significantly between\
        \ disease- and non-associated lineages (P = 0.0002, paired t-test; Fig. 2a).\
        \ From these results it is clear that, independent of other factors such as\
        \ host genetics or epigenetic lineage-specific factors, the microbiota is\
        \ sufficient to produce the observed variation in phenotypic response to DSS\

        \ variability\\n\\nHaving established the importance of the microbiota in\
        \ mediation of phenotypic outcomes to DSS in genetically identical mice, we\
        \ next sought to understand the degree of variability in the mouse microbiota\
        \ across a single facility, and to define changes in the microbiota that occur\
        \ with DSS treatment. Fecal samples were collected before DSS treatment and\
        \ 10 days after DSS exposure, and subjected to taxonomic profiling with 16\
        \ S ribosomal RNA amplicon sequencing to determine microbiota community composition.\
        \ Consistent with previous reports of gastrointestinal inflammation, this\
        \ analysis demonstrated a clear separation of microbiome community between\
        \ pre- and post-DSS samples (Fig. 2b,c and Extended Data Figs. 2 and 3) and\
        \ a significant reduction in bacterial diversity (Shannon diversity index,\
        \ P = 0.0357; Fig. 2d)12. Although expansion of Proteobacteria is often associated\
        \ with gut microbiome dysbiosis, while an increase in Proteobacteria was observed\
        \ post DSS (P < 0.05, Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test), limited association was\
        \ observed between weight loss and Proteobacteria proportion either pre (Fig.\
        \ 2e; Spearman correlation, 0.196) or post DSS treatment (Fig. 2e; Spearman\
        \ correlation, \u22120.289). This suggests that other gut bacteria may be\
        \ contributing to the observed variation in DSS resistance and susceptibility.\\\
        n\\nGiven the transmissibility of disease phenotype we observed in the germ-free\
        \ mouse experiments, we reasoned that the observed phenotypic variation was\
        \ primarily dependent on baseline microbiota composition before DSS treatment.\
        \ To understand the composition of microbiota associated with increased risk\
        \ of disease outcome, we applied linear discriminant analysis to gut microbiota\
        \ composition before and after DSS exposure24. This unsupervised analysis\
        \ leveraged the variability between mouse lineage-specific bacteria to identify\
        \ the bacterial taxa that most closely predict DSS response. Using this approach,\
        \ we identified two statistically different bacterial taxa associated with\
        \ no disease, and five statistically different bacterial taxa associated with\
        \ >5% weight loss. Notably, no relationship was observed between the occurrence\
        \ or abundance of these isolates in mice before DSS exposure, and equivalent\
        \ predictive bacterial taxa were not identified within the microbiota of mice\
        \ after DSS exposure. Our results suggest that the presence of specific gut\
        \ bacterial taxa before DSS exposure may influence disease severity and outcome,\
        \ possibly by either priming or protection from disease.\\n\\n### Isolation\
        \ of bacterial species for functional validation\\n\\nWhile we show clear\
        \ associations between specific bacterial taxa and DSS-mediated disease outcome\
        \ using 16 S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing, accurate taxonomic identification\
        \ to strain level and experimental validation require the isolation and genome\
        \ sequencing of pure clonal cultures of bacterial strains. To target and purify\
        \ bacterial strains, we next performed broad-based culture of ~2,000 bacterial\
        \ colonies from mouse fecal samples. The resulting isolates were identified\
        \ by capillary 16 S rRNA gene sequencing and included four previously identified\
        \ bacterial taxa, two \u2018disease associated\u2019 and two \u2018health\
        \ associated\u2019. These isolates were subjected to whole-genome sequencing\
        \ and genomic analysis to aid in precise taxonomic and phylogenetic assignment\
        \ (Extended Data Fig. 4). In addition, we performed extensive phenotypic characterization\
        \ and comparative genome analyses of these four species (Methods) as a basis\
        \ to provisionally name the health-associated bacteria Anaerostipes faecis\
        \ and Sangeribacter muris and the disease-associated bacteria Duncaniella\
        \ muricolitica and Alistipes okayasuensis; of note, the last three species\
        \ are mouse specific. Examination of the relative abundance of each of these\
        \ species before DSS treatment identified significantly higher levels of A.\
        \ faecis (P = 0264, t-test) and S. muris (P = 0.0010, t-test) in those mice\
        \ without weight loss, and significantly higher levels of D. muricolitica\
        \ (P = 0.0351, t-test) and A. okayasuensis (P = 0.0006, t-test) in mice that\
        \ experienced >5% weight loss (Fig. 2f).\\n\\nWe next repeated the DSS experimental\
        \ model in either germ-free mice or germ-free mice stably monocolonized for\
        \ 4 weeks with one of these four bacterial strains (Extended Data Figs. 5a\
        \ and 6). Control germ-free mice treated with DSS neither lost weight (Fig.\
        \ 3a) nor experienced mortality (Fig. 3b) over the course of the experiment,\
        \ suggesting that the presence of gut bacteria is important in triggering\
        \ overt disease in our facility. Comparable experimental outcomes were observed\
        \ in DSS-treated, germ-free mice monocolonized with either of the health-associated\
        \ bacteria, which did not lose weight or develop intestinal pathology (Fig.\
        \ 3a) nor experienced significant mortality (Fig. 3b). In contrast, when DSS-treated\
        \ mice were monocolonized with either of the disease-associated bacteria,\
        \ we observed more rapid and greater weight loss (Fig. 3a) and significantly\
        \ reduced survival (Fig. 3b). Therefore, we identified and validated D. muricolitica\
        \ and A. okayasuensis as mouse bacteria that can promote disease not observed\
        \ in mice monocolonized with the commensal bacteria S. muris and A. faecis.Fig.\

        \ understand inflammatory immune responses in the intestine potentially caused\
        \ by disease-associated versus health-associated species, we next examined\
        \ histology, immune cell populations and cytokine production. The human-colonizing\
        \ A. faecis and the facility-prevalent D. muricolitica were chosen as exemplary\
        \ disease- and health-associated bacteria, respectively, for these analyses.\
        \ Flow cytometric analysis of intestinal lamina propria leukocytes isolated\
        \ from germ-free mice monocolonized for 4 weeks with either A. faecis or D.\
        \ muricolitica revealed that colonization with either strain did not significantly\
        \ impact the composition of intestinal leukocyte and lymphocyte subsets (Extended\
        \ Data Figs. 5b,c and 6). However, the perturbation and epithelial disruption\
        \ induced by DSS led to significantly increased inflammatory CD64+CD11c+ monocytes/macrophages\
        \ in the lamina propria compartment of the large intestine in D. muricolitica\
        \ monocolonized mice, but not in A. faecis monocolonized mice (Extended Data\
        \ Figs. 5c,d and 6). These monocytes have been shown to play a pathogenic\
        \ role in the intestine in the context of Helicobacter-induced inflammation25.\
        \ This suggests that, although neither pathogenic nor immunogenic at homeostasis,\
        \ D. muricolitica drives increased inflammatory responses in the wake of epithelial\
        \ damage whereas health-associated A. faecis does not. Importantly, while\
        \ histological samples taken after 7 days of DSS treatment from colons and\
        \ caeca of D. muricolitica monocolonized mice occasionally exhibited features\
        \ of severe inflammation, this was not statistically different from that of\
        \ A. faecis monocolonized mice (Fig. 3c,d) and did not consistently correspond\
        \ to the weight loss observed. This again suggests that weight loss in the\
        \ DSS model may not always correlate with intestinal inflammation and pathology.\\\
        n\\nTo determine whether the presence of D. muricolitica or A. faecis had\
        \ a positive or negative correlation with weight change, we next examined\
        \ 20 independent mice and assessed the relationship between bacterial levels\
        \ using quantitative PCR (qPCR) before DSS treatment and weight change observed\
        \ at day 10. This analysis identified a positive correlation between weight\
        \ change and pre-DSS A. faecis abundance (R = 0.3679, P = 0.0046; Fig. 3e).\
        \ Similarly, a negative correlation was observed between weight change and\
        \ D. muricolitica abundance (R2 = 0.3626, P = 0.0050; Fig. 3e). This independent\
        \ confirmation provides further validation of the relationship between these\
        \ species and the severity of DSS colitis; however, additional work is needed\
        \ to confirm their roles as pathobionts.\\n\\n### Global distribution and\
        \ prevalence in other mouse facilities\\n\\nBecause D. muricolitica and A.\
        \ okayasuensis affected the outcome of DSS colitis in our mouse facility,\
        \ we next explored the presence and distribution of these bacteria in other\
        \ mouse facilities around the world. To do so, we first generated a global\
        \ representation of laboratory mouse intestinal microbiomes by curating 582\
        \ publicly available shotgun metagenome samples from \u2018control\u2019,\
        \ SPF mice. We combined this dataset with shotgun metagenomes from feces of\
        \ 40 mice at the Wellcome Sanger Institute to yield a global mouse gut microbiome\
        \ dataset covering 31 institutes across 12 countries. We then determined the\
        \ prevalence and abundance of health-associated bacteria S. muris and A. faecis\
        \ and disease-associated bacteria D. muricolitica and A. okayasuensis in this\
        \ mouse microbiome dataset.\\n\\nDuncaniella muricolitica and A. okayasuensis\
        \ were both dominant members of the mouse microbiome, present in 54.5 and\
        \ 47.9% of samples and with a mean abundance of 0.52 and 0.48% reads per sample,\
        \ respectively. Importantly, D. muricolitica and A. okayasuensis were each\
        \ detected in 80.6% (25/31) of the institutes included in the analyses (Fig.\
        \ 4), and there were only three institutes that did not contain either of\
        \ these species. For comparison, among health-associated species S. muris\
        \ was the most dominant in the mouse gut microbiota, present in 96.5% of samples\
        \ with a mean abundance of 6.2% reads, while A. faecis was a relatively minor\
        \ species, present in 5.9% of samples with a mean abundance of 0.22% reads.\
        \ S. muris was present in all (31/31) of the institutes included in the analyses,\
        \ whereas A. faecis was detected in 25.8% (8/31). The abundance of each species\
        \ also differed between institutes (Fig. 4). Thus, we show that mouse-derived\
        \ bacteria cultured from our institute are common mouse symbionts and, importantly,\
        \ D. muricolitica and A. okayasuensis are common, but not ubiquitous, in animal\
        \ facilities around the world.Fig. 4Global epidemiology and intrainstitutional\

        \ variability\\n\\nHaving established the importance of the microbiota in\
        \ mediation of phenotypic outcomes to DSS in genetically identical mice, we\
        \ next sought to understand the degree of variability in the mouse microbiota\
        \ across a single facility, and to define changes in the microbiota that occur\
        \ with DSS treatment. Fecal samples were collected before DSS treatment and\
        \ 10 days after DSS exposure, and subjected to taxonomic profiling with 16\
        \ S ribosomal RNA amplicon sequencing to determine microbiota community composition.\
        \ Consistent with previous reports of gastrointestinal inflammation, this\
        \ analysis demonstrated a clear separation of microbiome community between\
        \ pre- and post-DSS samples (Fig. 2b,c and Extended Data Figs. 2 and 3) and\
        \ a significant reduction in bacterial diversity (Shannon diversity index,\
        \ P = 0.0357; Fig. 2d)12. Although expansion of Proteobacteria is often associated\
        \ with gut microbiome dysbiosis, while an increase in Proteobacteria was observed\
        \ post DSS (P < 0.05, Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test), limited association was\
        \ observed between weight loss and Proteobacteria proportion either pre (Fig.\
        \ 2e; Spearman correlation, 0.196) or post DSS treatment (Fig. 2e; Spearman\
        \ correlation, \u22120.289). This suggests that other gut bacteria may be\
        \ contributing to the observed variation in DSS resistance and susceptibility.\\\
        n\\nGiven the transmissibility of disease phenotype we observed in the germ-free\
        \ mouse experiments, we reasoned that the observed phenotypic variation was\
        \ primarily dependent on baseline microbiota composition before DSS treatment.\
        \ To understand the composition of microbiota associated with increased risk\
        \ of disease outcome, we applied linear discriminant analysis to gut microbiota\
        \ composition before and after DSS exposure24. This unsupervised analysis\
        \ leveraged the variability between mouse lineage-specific bacteria to identify\
        \ the bacterial taxa that most closely predict DSS response. Using this approach,\
        \ we identified two statistically different bacterial taxa associated with\
        \ no disease, and five statistically different bacterial taxa associated with\
        \ >5% weight loss. Notably, no relationship was observed between the occurrence\
        \ or abundance of these isolates in mice before DSS exposure, and equivalent\
        \ predictive bacterial taxa were not identified within the microbiota of mice\
        \ after DSS exposure. Our results suggest that the presence of specific gut\
        \ bacterial taxa before DSS exposure may influence disease severity and outcome,\
        \ possibly by either priming or protection from disease.\\n\\n## Isolation\
        \ of bacterial species for functional validation\\n\\nWhile we show clear\
        \ associations between specific bacterial taxa and DSS-mediated disease outcome\
        \ using 16 S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing, accurate taxonomic identification\
        \ to strain level and experimental validation require the isolation and genome\
        \ sequencing of pure clonal cultures of bacterial strains. To target and purify\
        \ bacterial strains, we next performed broad-based culture of ~2,000 bacterial\
        \ colonies from mouse fecal samples. The resulting isolates were identified\
        \ by capillary 16 S rRNA gene sequencing and included four previously identified\
        \ bacterial taxa, two \u2018disease associated\u2019 and two \u2018health\
        \ associated\u2019. These isolates were subjected to whole-genome sequencing\
        \ and genomic analysis to aid in precise taxonomic and phylogenetic assignment\
        \ (Extended Data Fig. 4). In addition, we performed extensive phenotypic characterization\
        \ and comparative genome analyses of these four species (Methods) as a basis\
        \ to provisionally name the health-associated bacteria Anaerostipes faecis\
        \ and Sangeribacter muris and the disease-associated bacteria Duncaniella\
        \ muricolitica and Alistipes okayasuensis; of note, the last three species\
        \ are mouse specific. Examination of the relative abundance of each of these\
        \ species before DSS treatment identified significantly higher levels of A.\
        \ faecis (P = 0264, t-test) and S. muris (P = 0.0010, t-test) in those mice\
        \ without weight loss, and significantly higher levels of D. muricolitica\
        \ (P = 0.0351, t-test) and A. okayasuensis (P = 0.0006, t-test) in mice that\
        \ experienced >5% weight loss (Fig. 2f).\\n\\nWe next repeated the DSS experimental\
        \ model in either germ-free mice or germ-free mice stably monocolonized for\
        \ 4 weeks with one of these four bacterial strains (Extended Data Figs. 5a\
        \ and 6). Control germ-free mice treated with DSS neither lost weight (Fig.\
        \ 3a) nor experienced mortality (Fig. 3b) over the course of the experiment,\
        \ suggesting that the presence of gut bacteria is important in triggering\
        \ overt disease in our facility. Comparable experimental outcomes were observed\
        \ in DSS-treated, germ-free mice monocolonized with either of the health-associated\
        \ bacteria, which did not lose weight or develop intestinal pathology (Fig.\
        \ 3a) nor experienced significant mortality (Fig. 3b). In contrast, when DSS-treated\
        \ mice were monocolonized with either of the disease-associated bacteria,\
        \ we observed more rapid and greater weight loss (Fig. 3a) and significantly\
        \ reduced survival (Fig. 3b). Therefore, we identified and validated D. muricolitica\
        \ and A. okayasuensis as mouse bacteria that can promote disease not observed\
        \ in mice monocolonized with the commensal bacteria S. muris and A. faecis.Fig.\

        \ understand inflammatory immune responses in the intestine potentially caused\
        \ by disease-associated versus health-associated species, we next examined\
        \ histology, immune cell populations and cytokine production. The human-colonizing\
        \ A. faecis and the facility-prevalent D. muricolitica were chosen as exemplary\
        \ disease- and health-associated bacteria, respectively, for these analyses.\
        \ Flow cytometric analysis of intestinal lamina propria leukocytes isolated\
        \ from germ-free mice monocolonized for 4 weeks with either A. faecis or D.\
        \ muricolitica revealed that colonization with either strain did not significantly\
        \ impact the composition of intestinal leukocyte and lymphocyte subsets (Extended\
        \ Data Figs. 5b,c and 6). However, the perturbation and epithelial disruption\
        \ induced by DSS led to significantly increased inflammatory CD64+CD11c+ monocytes/macrophages\
        \ in the lamina propria compartment of the large intestine in D. muricolitica\
        \ monocolonized mice, but not in A. faecis monocolonized mice (Extended Data\
        \ Figs. 5c,d and 6). These monocytes have been shown to play a pathogenic\
        \ role in the intestine in the context of Helicobacter-induced inflammation25.\
        \ This suggests that, although neither pathogenic nor immunogenic at homeostasis,\
        \ D. muricolitica drives increased inflammatory responses in the wake of epithelial\
        \ damage whereas health-associated A. faecis does not. Importantly, while\
        \ histological samples taken after 7 days of DSS treatment from colons and\
        \ caeca of D. muricolitica monocolonized mice occasionally exhibited features\
        \ of severe inflammation, this was not statistically different from that of\
        \ A. faecis monocolonized mice (Fig. 3c,d) and did not consistently correspond\
        \ to the weight loss observed. This again suggests that weight loss in the\
        \ DSS model may not always correlate with intestinal inflammation and pathology.\\\
        n\\nTo determine whether the presence of D. muricolitica or A. faecis had\
        \ a positive or negative correlation with weight change, we next examined\
        \ 20 independent mice and assessed the relationship between bacterial levels\
        \ using quantitative PCR (qPCR) before DSS treatment and weight change observed\
        \ at day 10. This analysis identified a positive correlation between weight\
        \ change and pre-DSS A. faecis abundance (R = 0.3679, P = 0.0046; Fig. 3e).\
        \ Similarly, a negative correlation was observed between weight change and\
        \ D. muricolitica abundance (R2 = 0.3626, P = 0.0050; Fig. 3e). This independent\
        \ confirmation provides further validation of the relationship between these\
        \ species and the severity of DSS colitis; however, additional work is needed\
        \ to confirm their roles as pathobionts.\\n\\n## Global distribution and prevalence\
        \ in other mouse facilities\\n\\nBecause D. muricolitica and A. okayasuensis\
        \ affected the outcome of DSS colitis in our mouse facility, we next explored\
        \ the presence and distribution of these bacteria in other mouse facilities\
        \ around the world. To do so, we first generated a global representation of\
        \ laboratory mouse intestinal microbiomes by curating 582 publicly available\
        \ shotgun metagenome samples from \u2018control\u2019, SPF mice. We combined\
        \ this dataset with shotgun metagenomes from feces of 40 mice at the Wellcome\
        \ Sanger Institute to yield a global mouse gut microbiome dataset covering\
        \ 31 institutes across 12 countries. We then determined the prevalence and\
        \ abundance of health-associated bacteria S. muris and A. faecis and disease-associated\
        \ bacteria D. muricolitica and A. okayasuensis in this mouse microbiome dataset.\\\
        n\\nDuncaniella muricolitica and A. okayasuensis were both dominant members\
        \ of the mouse microbiome, present in 54.5 and 47.9% of samples and with a\
        \ mean abundance of 0.52 and 0.48% reads per sample, respectively. Importantly,\
        \ D. muricolitica and A. okayasuensis were each detected in 80.6% (25/31)\
        \ of the institutes included in the analyses (Fig. 4), and there were only\
        \ three institutes that did not contain either of these species. For comparison,\
        \ among health-associated species S. muris was the most dominant in the mouse\
        \ gut microbiota, present in 96.5% of samples with a mean abundance of 6.2%\
        \ reads, while A. faecis was a relatively minor species, present in 5.9% of\
        \ samples with a mean abundance of 0.22% reads. S. muris was present in all\
        \ (31/31) of the institutes included in the analyses, whereas A. faecis was\
        \ detected in 25.8% (8/31). The abundance of each species also differed between\
        \ institutes (Fig. 4). Thus, we show that mouse-derived bacteria cultured\
        \ from our institute are common mouse symbionts and, importantly, D. muricolitica\
        \ and A. okayasuensis are common, but not ubiquitous, in animal facilities\
        \ around the world.Fig. 4Global epidemiology and intrainstitutional variation\

        n\\nDespite experimental variability in the DSS mouse model, which limits\
        \ the interpretation and translation of data, the model is increasingly used\
        \ in basic research (>6,000 DSS model publications on PubMed) and by the pharmaceutical\
        \ and biotechnology industries. Cohousing, heterozygote mating and other experimental\
        \ procedures have been used in an attempt to normalize the microbiota within\
        \ experiments and ensure direct measures of the effects of mouse genetic background\
        \ on disease phenotype rather than indirect and unknown microbiota-associated\
        \ effects26. In our approach we leveraged this variability in DSS outcome,\
        \ in combination with microbiome analysis, machine learning, anerobic culturing\
        \ and germ-free mouse validation experiments, to gain relevant biological\
        \ insight into microbiota determinants of DSS disease. While this consideration\
        \ of the microbiome did not completely eliminate the impact of multidimensionality\
        \ in the DSS model, we identified and undertook experimental validation of\
        \ D. muricolitica and A. okayasuensis, both of which have a dominant effect\
        \ on DSS outcome.\\n\\nInterestingly, D. muricolitica and A. okayasuensis\
        \ are phylogenetically distinct from each other and neither had computationally\
        \ predicted virulence factors within their genome. While it remains unclear\
        \ how these isolates contribute to DSS disease, both exhibit a potential for\
        \ polysaccharide utilization that may mediate this relationship through interaction\
        \ with the mucus layer. We also noted that weight loss and intestinal pathology\
        \ do not always correlate, so they should not necessarily be used as surrogates\
        \ for each other. Similarly, substantial weight loss was observed in monocolonized\
        \ mice even in the absence of severe inflammation, suggesting that activation\
        \ of key pathways alone can have a substantial impact on experimental outcome.\
        \ Together, these insights raise the need for further experimental study of\
        \ host interactions and the biology of these important mouse-specific bacteria.\\\
        n\\nWe propose that researchers should consider monitoring for D. muricolitica\
        \ and A. okayasuensis in their mouse facilities, as is undertaken for other\
        \ immunophenotyped-affecting microbes such as segmented filamentous bacteria27.\
        \ In some cases, precolonization of animals with these bacteria, if they are\
        \ not present in the facility, may yield better experimental control and increase\
        \ confidence in this important and widely used mouse model of human disease.\
        \ Overall, our work suggests that the application of metagenomics techniques\
        \ to report microbiota composition, in addition to the genetic and disease\
        \ phenotypes being described, should represent a standard minimum requirement\
        \ for the DSS mouse model. We have deposited the D. muricolitis, A. okayasuensis,\
        \ S. muris and A. faecis strains and genomes in public repositories to support\
        \ this work.\\n\\n## Methods\\n\\n### Mouse models\\n\\nMice were maintained\
        \ under either germ-free or SPF conditions at the Wellcome Sanger Institute\
        \ Home Office-approved facility, with all procedures carried out in accordance\
        \ with the United Kingdom Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act of 1986 under\
        \ Home Office approval (PPL no. 80/2643). Germ-free mice were maintained in\
        \ positive-pressure isolators (Bell), with feces tested by culture, microscopy\
        \ and PCR to ensure sterility. Consumables were autoclaved at 121 \xB0C for\
        \ 15 min before introduction into the isolators. For experimentation, cages\
        \ were opened in a vaporized hydrogen peroxide-sterilized, class II cabinet\
        \ (Bioquell), with fecal transplant and monocolonized gnotobiotic lines generated\
        \ by weekly oral gavage over a 3-week period. Materials were prepared in Dulbecco\u2019\
        s PBS at 100 mg ml\u20131 immediately before administration under anaerobic\
        \ conditions (10% H, 10% CO2, 80% N) in a Whitley DG250 workstation at 37\
        \ \xB0C (ref. 8). Mice were maintained in sterile ISOcages (Tecniplast) and\
        \ housed on ISOrack for the period of the experiment.\\n\\n### DSS colitis\
        \ challenge\\n\\nDextran sulphate sodium was administered at a concentration\
        \ of 1.5% (w/v) (Affymetrix, Inc., average molecular weight 44 kDa) in drinking\
        \ water for 7 days, followed by 3 days with regular drinking water, to C57BL6/6N\
        \ mice aged 7\u201316 weeks (297 male, 282 female; median age 11 weeks; s.d.\
        \ 12 days). Mice were weighed every day and culled if weight loss reached\
        \ 20% of starting weight. Average weight loss curves were censored for each\
        \ group when the first member of the group reached this endpoint, to avoid\
        \ misleading calculations of the average using the remaining members. No statistical\
        \ methods were used to predetermine sample sizes in these experiments.\\n\\\
        n### Histological assessment of intestinal inflammation\\n\\nDextran sulphate\
        \ sodium-treated SPF mice were sacrificed at day 10 by cervical dislocation,\
        \ and samples from mid and distal colon taken. Tissue sections were fixed\
        \ in buffered 10% formalin, paraffin embedded, cut and stained with hematoxylin\
        \ and eosin (H&E). Colon histopathology was blind-graded semiquantitatively,\
        \ on a scale from zero to three, for four criteria: (1) degree of epithelial\
        \ hyperplasia/damage and goblet cell depletion; (2) leukocyte infiltration\
        \ in lamina propria; (3) area of tissue affected; and (4) presence of markers\
        \ of severe inflammation, including crypt abscesses, submucosal inflammation\
        \ and edema. Scores for individual criteria were added for an overall inflammation\
        \ score of between zero and 12 for each sample. Scores from mid and distal\
        \ colon were then averaged to obtain inflammation scores for each mouse colon.\\\
        n\\nMonocolonized, germ-free mice were euthanized 7 days after DSS administration\
        \ and samples taken from the cecum and midcolon. Tissue sections were fixed\
        \ in methacarn, paraffin embedded, sectioned and stained with H&E. Colon and\
        \ cecum histopathology was graded on a semiquantitative scale by a pathologist\
        \ blinded to the groups. The criteria scored were (1) degree of epithelial\
        \ hyperplasia/damage and goblet cell depletion; (2) severity of leukocyte\
        \ infiltration in lamina propria; (3) extent of inflammation; and (4) presence\
        \ of markers of severe inflammation, including crypt abscesses, submucosal\
        \ inflammation and edema. Each criterion was scored on a scale of zero to\
        \ three based on previously described thresholds28 and the sum of the individual\
        \ scores was recorded as an indication of overall inflammation. For all animal\
        \ experiments, treatments were randomized by cage by researchers blinded to\
        \ treatment conditions. For statistical analysis, distribution was assumed\
        \ to be normal but this was not formally tested\\n\\n### Bacterial culture\\\
        n\\nFecal samples and bacterial isolates were cultured for anaerobic gastrointestinal\
        \ bacteria under anaerobic conditions (10% H, 10% CO2, 80% N) in a Whitley\
        \ DG250 workstation at 37 \xB0C (ref. 8). Fecal samples were homogenized in\
        \ reduced PBS (0.1 g ml\u20131 PBS), serially diluted and plated directly\
        \ onto YCFA agar supplemented with 0.002 g ml\u22121 each of glucose, maltose\
        \ and cellobiose. Colonies were picked, restreaked to purity and identified\
        \ using 16 S rRNA gene sequencing.\\n\\n### Microbiota profiling and analysis\\\
        n\\nFecal samples were collected directly from mice and immediately stored\
        \ at \u221280 \xB0C until DNA extraction. DNA was extracted from samples using\
        \ the FastDNA Spin Kit for Soil (MPBio) and stored at \u221220 \xB0C until\
        \ metagenomic sequencing. DNA samples were quantified using a Qubit 4 Fluorometer\
        \ (Thermo Fisher). 16 S rRNA amplicon-based profiling was performed using\
        \ the FastDNA Spin Kit for Soil (MP Biomedicals) on 300 mg of fecal sample\
        \ from each mouse. The V1\u2013V2 region of 16 S rRNA genes was amplified\
        \ with a Q5 High-Fidelity Polymerase Kit (New England Biolabs): F': AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACAC-TATGGTAATT-CC-AGMGTTYGATYMTGGCTCAG;\
        \ R': CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGATACGAGACTGATTAGTCAGTCAGAAGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAG. Each\
        \ PCR amplification was performed as four independent amplifications and pooled\
        \ in equimolar amounts for 150-base-paired (bp)-end sequencing with the Illumina\
        \ MiSeq platform. For shotgun metagenomic sequencing, samples with >100 ng\
        \ of DNA material were processed onward to paired-end (2 \xD7 150 bp) metagenomics\
        \ sequencing on the HiSeq 4000 platform as per standard manufacturer library\
        \ preparation and sequencing protocols.\\n\\n### Metagenomic data analysis\\\
        n\\nAnalysis of 16 S rRNA amplicon sequences was performed with mothur MiSeq\
        \ SOP v.1.42.3 using SILVA v.132 (ref. 29). The 16 S rRNA gene alignments\
        \ were used to determine maximum likelihood phylogeny using FastTree v.2.1.10\
        \ (ref. 30). Phylogenetic trees were visualized and edited using iTOL31. Shotgun\
        \ metagenomic reads were filtered for quality and adapter sequences using\
        \ KneadData v.0.7.3, with default settings. Host reads were removed from samples\
        \ using the GRCm39 reference genome and Bowtie2 v.2.3.5. In addition, reads\
        \ were aligned to the Phi X 174 genome and removed. Taxonomic classification\
        \ of metagenomic reads was performed using Kraken2 v.2.0.8 and a custom database\
        \ built from the genomes of the Mouse Gut Bacterial Catalog (MGBC).\\n\\nAll\
        \ data analyses were performed in R v.4.0.2. Species abundant at \u22650.01%\
        \ reads were considered present in a sample, and operational taxonomic units\
        \ (OTUs) were considered statistically different at P < 0.05. For shotgun\
        \ metagenomic sequencing, relative abundance of species was corrected using\
        \ Bracken v.2.5.2. Bar plots for species prevalence data and sample numbers\
        \ were generated using the ggplot2 v.3.3.3 package. To quantify and visualize\
        \ intrainstitute abundance, species abundance data for each sample underwent\
        \ Bayesian multiplicative replacement of zero counts using the zCompositions\
        \ v.1.3.4 package, and the data transformed using center log-ratio normalization.\
        \ Mean abundance per sample was then calculated and visualized using the pheatmap\
        \ v.1.0.12 package. Principal component analyses were performed in R, and\
        \ linear regression analysis was performed using the linear regression function\
        \ in python scikit-learn v.0.20.4. Alpha diversity was assessed using Vegan\
        \ v.2.5.6 (ref. 30). Correlation analysis was performed using Spearman\u2019\
        s rank correlation coefficient.\\n\\n### Curation of public metagenome samples\\\
        n\\nTo assess the abundance of both health- and disease-associated bacteria\
        \ in mice from different institutes, we curated publicly available fecal shotgun\
        \ metagenomes for healthy, control SPF mice from NCBI and ENA. These samples\
        \ included mice from different genetic backgrounds and strains, but samples\
        \ were excluded if mice were younger than 3 weeks, had received antimicrobial\
        \ treatment or dietary intervention or had gene knockout. In total 582 fecal\
        \ shotgun metagenomes were curated.\\n\\n### qPCR of bacterial load\\n\\nAnaerostipes\
        \ faecis and D. muricolitica were quantified in the feces of SPF mice using\
        \ qPCR with custom primers. Primers were designed using the taxon-linked gene\
        \ catalog of MGBC32. Briefly, we identified gene targets that were both unique\
        \ to, and highly conserved in, the genome of each species. To ensure target\
        \ specificity, we selected gene clusters that shared <50% sequence identity\
        \ with all nontarget species sequences. Gene targets were defined as highly\
        \ conserved if they were identified in 100% of high-quality target species\
        \ genomes in the MGBC. Furthermore, only single-copy-number gene targets were\
        \ considered. Sequences for selected gene products were then clustered at\
        \ 90% sequence identity and used as templates for design of PCR primers with\
        \ NCBI Primer-BLAST33, ensuring specificity against the NCBI nonredundant\
        \ gene catalog. Two primers for each species were used in conjunction for\
        \ qPCR.\\n\\nPrimers: A14_1 (gene target: MGBC000029_00009), forward 5'-AGCTGTTCAGGTGTCTGATCTT-3',\

        \ Kit for Soil (MPBio) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions,\
        \ and DNA eluted into 100 \xB5l of double-distilled H2O. Eluted DNA was then\
        \ diluted 1:50 and qPCR performed using SYBR Green chemistry (Thermo Fisher).\
        \ To approximate the relative abundance of target species in SPF feces, cycle\
        \ threshold values were normalized to those of a universal bacterial 16 S\
        \ primer (F: 5'- GTGSTGCAYGGYTGTCGTCA-3'; R: 5'- ACGTCRTCCMCACCTTCCTC-3').\\\
        n\\n### Intestinal immune cell isolation\\n\\nLarge intestines were excised\
        \ and separated from mesentery and fat. Transluminal sections were taken from\
        \ the cecum and distal colon for histology. The intestines were opened longitudinally,\
        \ cleared of feces then washed three times in cold PBS. To isolate intraepithelial\
        \ immune populations, the large intestines were cut into 1-cm pieces, washed\
        \ in cold PBS then incubated in 10 ml of PBS + 1 mM dithiothreitol for 10\
        \ min. Tissues were manually disrupted via shaking and then strained, with\
        \ supernatant then collected. Tissues were incubated in 10 ml of PBS + 30\
        \ mM EDTA + 10 ml of HEPES at 37 \xB0C and 200 r.p.m., before being shaken\
        \ and strained. The supernatants from these two steps were pooled, filtered\
        \ at 70 \xB5m and the filtrate fractionated using a discontinuous Percoll\
        \ gradient (80/40%). Epithelial cells were isolated from the surface of the\
        \ Percoll, and intraepithelial immune cells isolated from the interface.\\\
        n\\nTo access the lamina propria compartment, tissues were manually chopped\
        \ and digested in HBSS + 25 mM HEPES + 1 mM sodium pyruvate containing 0.05\
        \ mg ml\u20131 Collagenase VIII (Sigma) and 50 \xB5g ml\u20131 DNase I (Sigma)\
        \ for 1 h at 37 \xB0C and 80 r.p.m. Samples were mechanically disrupted and\
        \ filtered at 70 \xB5m. The filtrate was fractionated using a discontinuous\
        \ Percoll gradient (80/40%). Lamina propria immune cells were isolated from\
        \ the interface.\\n\\n### Flow cytometry\\n\\nIntestinal and mesenteric lymph\
        \ node immune cell populations were characterized by flow cytometry. For intracellular\
        \ cytokine staining, cells were incubated in T cell medium (RPMI, 10% FBS,\
        \ 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 2 mM GLUTamax, 1\xD7 nonessential amino acids, 0.1\
        \ mM 2-\u03B2-mercaptoethanol, 10 mM HEPES, 1% penicillin/streptomycin) +\
        \ 1\xD7 Cell Stimulation Cocktail with Protein Inhibitors (eBioscience) for\
        \ 3 h at 37 \xB0C before staining. Nonviable cells were stained using Live/Dead\
        \ Fixable Aqua. Cells were permeabilized with CytoFix/CytoPerm (BD), followed\
        \ by intracellular staining in PermBuffer (eBioscience).\\n\\nAll antibodies\
        \ were purchased from eBioscience unless otherwise indicated. Antibodies used\
        \ were CD45-SB600, TCRb-APC-Cy7, MHCII-FITC, CD4-PE-Cy7, CD8a-AF700, CD8b-PE,\

        n\\nWhile genomes are publicly available for the species described in this\
        \ paper, and are represented by genomic species clusters in the Genome Taxonomy\
        \ Database: A14 = Anaerostipes sp000508985 (GCF_000508985.1: 98.76% ANI),\
        \ A43 = CAG-485 sp002362485 (GCF_003833075.1: 98.66% ANI), A60 = Duncaniella\

        \ 98.54% ANI)). These species have not yet been characterized, nor have these\
        \ names been validly published according to the International Code of Nomenclature\
        \ of Prokaryotes. Because these species are uncharacterized, they are referred\
        \ to as previously undescribed in this manuscript. Phenotypic data for the\
        \ capacity of each species to utilize 95 substrates as sole carbon sources\
        \ were attained using the BioLog platform (see BioLog analysis for a description\
        \ of methodology). Isolated genomes were functionally annotated using eggNOG-mapper\
        \ v.2 and InterProScan v.5. We describe these species and propose new names\
        \ below.\\n\\n#### Description of \u2018Alistipes okayasuensis\u2019 sp. nov\\\
        n\\nAlistipes okayasuensis (o\u2019ka.ya.su.en.sis. N.L. masc./fem. adj. okayasuensis)\
        \ is named after Isao Okayasu, who first described DSS colitis as a model\
        \ for ulcerative colitis in mice. Phylogenomic analyses place strain A61T\
        \ in the Alistipes cluster. The digital DNA\u2013DNA hybridization (dDDH)\
        \ value between A. onderdonkii and A. putredinis is 24.4%, while dDDH values\
        \ between strain A61T, A. onderdonkii and A. putredinis are 25.2 and 21.4%,\
        \ respectively. The G + C content difference between the genome of strain\
        \ A61T and A. onderdonkii, its closest phylogenomic neighbor, is 1.39%, while\
        \ their 16S rRNA gene sequence identity is 96.03%. These analyses strongly\
        \ indicate that \u2018Alistipes okayasuensis\u2019 is a separate species within\
        \ the genus Alistipes.\\n\\nThis strain is a strict anaerobe. Carbon source\
        \ utilization analysis was combined with reconstruction of Kyoto Encyclopedia\
        \ of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) metabolic pathways (55.58% of 2,022 predicted\
        \ open reading frames (ORFs) could be annotated) to functionally characterize\
        \ the strain. The strain encodes 47 genes predicted to be carbohydrate-active\
        \ enzymes (CAZymes), including 29 glycoside hydrolases: seven beta-glucosidases\
        \ (GH3, EC 3.2.1.21); five beta-galactosidases (EC 3.2.1.23); five endohydrolytic\
        \ alpha-glucosidases (GH13), including four alpha-amylases (EC 3.2.1.1); three\
        \ exohydrolytic alpha-glucosidases (GH31, EC 3.2.1.20); three cellulases (EC\
        \ 3.2.1.4); three mannan endo-1,4-beta-mannosidases (EC 3.2.1.78); and an\
        \ alpha-l-fucosidase (EC 3.2.1.51). Despite this predicted hydrolytic potential,\
        \ the strain shows limited capacity to utilize disaccharides and oligosaccharides\
        \ as sole carbon sources. While the strain tested positive for utilization\
        \ of alpha-d-lactose, sucrose and maltotriose, it tested negative for utilization\
        \ of d-cellobiose, dextrin, cyclodextrin, gentiobiose, lactulose, maltose,\
        \ d-melezitose, d-melibiose, palatinose, d-raffinose, stachyose, d-trehalose,\
        \ fucose or turanose.\\n\\nThe strain is predicted to encode enzymes for metabolism\
        \ of l-histidine to l-glutamate via 4-Imidazolone-5-phsophate (EC 4.3.1.3,\
        \ EC 4.2.1.49, EC 3.5.2.7, EC 2.1.2.5). In support of these predictions, the\
        \ strain is capable of utilizing urocanate as a sole carbon source. In keeping\
        \ with other members of the genus Alistipes, this strain is predicted to encode\
        \ a putative tryptophanase (EC 4.1.99.1) that would allow it to hydrolyze\
        \ tryptophan to indole. The strain is also predicted to encode a butyrate\
        \ phosphotransferase (EC 2.3.1.19) and a butyrate kinase (EC 2.7.2.7), indicating\
        \ its potential to metabolize butyrate. The genome is 2,329,524 bp with a\
        \ G + C content of 56.45 mol%. We propose the name \u2018Alistipes okayasuensis\u2019\
        \ for this previously undescribed species, in reference to the origins of\
        \ the DSS colitis model and reflecting this species\u2019 association with\
        \ poor outcomes of this disease model. The type strain is A61T (=CCUG 75087T\
        \ =SM 112987T).\\n\\n#### Description of \u2018Anaerostipes faecis\u2019 sp.\
        \ nov\\n\\nAnaerostipes faecis (fae\u2019cis. L. gen. fem. n. faecis, of feces,\
        \ referring to fecal origin). The closest phylogenomic neighbor of strain\
        \ A14T is Anaerostipes caccae, with a dDDH value of 48.40%. The pairwise 16\
        \ S rRNA gene sequence identity of A14T and A. caccae DSM 14662T is 98.16%.\
        \ These analyses indicate that A14T is a separate species within the genus\
        \ Anaerostipes. The genome is 3,200,246 bp with a G + C content of 43.77 mol%.\
        \ We propose the name \u2018Anaerostipes faecis\u2019 for this new species.\
        \ The type strain is A14T (=CCUG 75084T).\\n\\nThe strain is strictly anaerobic.\
        \ Reconstruction of KEGG metabolic pathways (55.4% of 3,222 predicted ORFs\
        \ could be annotated) indicates that the strain can produce butyrate via a\
        \ butyrate phosphotransferase/butyrate kinase operon (EC 2.7.2.7, EC 2.3.1.91),\
        \ in keeping with the genus type species A. caccae. Likewise, the strain is\
        \ predicted to encode an arginine dihydrolase (EC 3.5.3.6). In contrast to\
        \ the genus description, however, this strain is predicted to encode neither\
        \ an alpha-galactosidase (EC 3.2.1.22) nor a phosphoamidase (EC 3.9.1.1).\\\
        n\\nThe strain shows limited capacity to utilize monosaccharides as sole carbon\
        \ sources: it had a robust phenotype for utilization of 3-methyl-d-glucose\
        \ but tested negative for its ability to utilize other monosaccharides including\
        \ d-fructose, d-galactose, d-mannose or d-glucose as sole carbon sources.\
        \ Notably, the strain is predicted to encode the complete Leloir pathway for\
        \ galactose metabolism, as well as multiple beta-galactosidases (EC 3.2.1.23),\
        \ indicating that it might lack a galactose transporter but could metabolize\
        \ galactose in different contexts such as downstream of other pathways of\
        \ carbohydrate metabolism. The strain can utilize some disaccharides, testing\
        \ positive for sucrose utilization, potentially via multiple oligo-1,6-glucosidases\
        \ (EC 3.2.1.10), d-trehalose utilization, potentially via three trehalases\
        \ (EC 3.2.1.28, GH37, GH65) and turanose utilization. However, the strain\
        \ tested negative for its ability to utilize alpha-d-lactose, lactulose, maltose,\
        \ d-melibiose, gentiobiose, d-cellobiose or palatinose. Additionally, the\
        \ strain tested negative for utilization of the trisccharides maltotriose,\
        \ d-melezitose and d-raffinose and the tetrasaccharide stachyose\u2014potentially\
        \ due to the absence of a predicted alpha-galactosidase. The strain could\
        \ utilize beta-cyclodextrin, but tested negative for utilization of dextrin\
        \ and alpha-cyclodextrin. The strain is capable of utilizing alpha-ketovaleric\
        \ acid and d-malic acid, as well as certain amino acids and derivatives including\
        \ l-threonine, l-asparagine, l-serine and the dipeptides glycyl-l-proline\
        \ and l-alanyl-l-threonine. The strain tested negative for utilization of\
        \ l-glutamine, l-glutamate, l-valine and l-alanine.\\n\\n#### Description\
        \ of \u2018Duncaniella muricolitica\u2019 sp. nov\\n\\nDuncaniella muricolitica\
        \ (mu.ri.co\u2019li.ti.ca. L. gen. n. muris, of the mouse; Gr. n. kolon, colon;\
        \ Gr. suff. -tikos -\xEA -on, suffix used with the sense of pertaining to;\
        \ N.L. fem. adj. muricolitica, pertaining to the colon of the mouse). The\
        \ closest phylogenetic neighbor, according to pairwise 16 S rRNA gene analyses,\
        \ is Duncaniella dubosii with a sequence identity of 94.04%. The 16 S gene\
        \ sequence identity values between D. dubosii H5T and other species of the\
        \ genus, D. muris DSM 103720T and D. freteri TLL-A3T, are 95.14 and 93.00%,\
        \ respectively, indicating that A60T is a separate species within the Duncaniella\
        \ cluster. The dDDH value between A60T and D. dubosii H5T is 28.10%, confirming\
        \ a separate species status.\\n\\nRecent work benchmarking an average nucleotide\
        \ identity1 approach to define genus boundaries found that the genus inflection\
        \ points of members of the order Bacteroidales had relatively low values for\
        \ alignment fraction (AF) and ANI (AF/ANI: Bacteroides fragilis, 0.215/71.23;\
        \ Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, 0.105/68.12; Prevotella melaninogenica, 0.195/72.07).\
        \ The corresponding values between A60T and the genus type species D. muris\
        \ are 0.243/80.85, providing further evidence that A60T belongs to the genus\
        \ Duncaniella.\\n\\nThe strain is an obligate anaerobe. Reconstruction of\
        \ KEGG metabolic pathways (47.2% of 3,461 predicted ORFs could be annotated)\
        \ indicated that strain is enriched for enzymes with glycoside hydrolase activity,\
        \ encoding 47 in total. The strain is able to utilize dextrin, beta-cyclodextrin\
        \ and multiple oligosaccharides including d-melezitose, maltotriose, amygdalin,\
        \ maltose, gentiobiose (EC: 3.2.1.21), turanose and d-cellobiose (EC: 2.4.1.20;\
        \ EC: 3.2.1.21). The strain is capable of utilizing d-raffinose, and is predicted\
        \ from its genome to produce sucrose as an intermediate (EC: 3.2.1.22, EC:\
        \ 3.2.1.20) rather than stachyose or melibiose. Additionally, the strain tested\
        \ negative for utilization of both stachyose and melibiose. In our study the\
        \ strain tested negative for an ability to utilize lactose as a single carbon\
        \ source, even though it encodes seven predicted beta-galactosidases (EC 3.2.1.23).\
        \ The strain is predicted to encode 36 glycosyltransferase enzymes, among\
        \ which are seven GT2 family enzymes including two dolichyl-phosphate beta-d-mannosyltransferases\
        \ (EC: 2.4.1.82).\\n\\nThe strain can utilize a variety of monosaccharides\
        \ as single carbon sources, including alpha-d-glucose, alpha-d-glucose 1-phosphate,\
        \ 3-methyl-d-glucose, d-galactose, alpha-methyl-d-galactose, d-mannose, adonitol,\
        \ arabinose, d-gluconate, d-arabitol and d-sorbitol. It tested negative for\
        \ an ability to utilize fucose, alpha-d-lactose, d-fructose, lactate, lactulose,\
        \ d-trehalose or l-rhamnose as sole carbon sources. The strain is predicted\
        \ to encode the pathway for metabolism of l-histidine to l-glutamate via 4-Imidazolone-5-phsophate\
        \ (EC 4.3.1.3, EC 4.2.1.49, EC 3.5.2.7, EC 2.1.2.5), and tested positive for\
        \ utilization of urocanate. The genome is 4,055,027 bp with a G + C content\
        \ of 50.9 mol%. Following functional and genomic characterization of our isolate,\
        \ we propose the name \u2018Duncaniella muricolitica\u2019 for this species\
        \ in reference to its association with poor prognosis in the murine DSS model\

        \ family, and \u2018Sangeribacter\u2019 possesses all the features of this\
        \ family. The pairwise sequence identity of the 16 S rRNA gene of A43T with\
        \ 16 S genes from Paramuribaculum intestinale DSM 100749T, Muribaculum intestinale\
        \ YL27T and Duncaniella muris DSM 103720T is 88.90, 88.22 and 87.39%, respectively.\
        \ The dDDH value between A43T and Paramuribaculum intestinale DSM 100749T\
        \ is 35.5% and the difference in G + C mol% is 6.37%. Together these analyses\
        \ strongly indicate that \u2018Sangeribacter\u2019 is a separate genus. The\
        \ type species, Sangeribacter muris, is one of the most dominant species in\
        \ the mouse gut microbiota, representing up to 60% of classified reads in\
        \ some mouse fecal shotgun metagenome samples. It is also highly prevalent,\
        \ present in 77% of 1,926 samples.\\n\\n#### Description of \u2018Sangeribacter\
        \ muris\u2019 sp. nov\\n\\nSangeribacter muris (mu\u2019ris. L. gen. masc./fem.\
        \ n. muris, of the mouse, the species was first isolated from a mouse). The\
        \ strain is a strict anaerobe. It is predicted to encode 66 CAZymes including\
        \ 42 glycoside hydrolases. The strain tested positive for utilization of a\
        \ wide repertoire of glycans and carbohydrates, including dextrin (EC 3.2.1.3),\
        \ alpha- and beta-cyclodextrin, stachyose (EC 3.2.1.22), d-raffinose (EC 3.2.1.26),\
        \ maltotriose, d-melezitose, amygdalin (EC 3.2.1.22), d-cellobiose (EC 3.2.1.21,\
        \ EC 2.4.1.20), gentiobiose (EC 3.2.1.21), d-melibiose, palatinose, d-trehalose\
        \ (EC 2.7.1.201, EC 2.4.1.64, EC 3.1.3.12), turanose, sucrose (EC 2.7.1.211),\
        \ d-glucosaminate, lactulose, alpha-d-lactose, alpha-d-glucose, alpha-D-glucose\
        \ 1-phosphate, 3-methyl-d-glucose, d-glucosaminic acid, alpha- and beta-methyl-d-glucoside,\
        \ d-fructose (EC 2.7.1.4), d-mannitol (EC 1.1.1.67), d-mannose, d-galactose,\
        \ alpha- and beta-methyl-d-galactoside, d-galacturonic acid, l-sorbitol (EC\
        \ 1.1.1.14) and l-fucose (EC 3.2.1.51). This strain tested negative for its\
        \ ability to utilize adonitol, dulcitol or d-gluconate as single carbon sources.\\\
        n\\nThe strain tested positive for its ability to utilize certain amino acids\
        \ and their derivatives, including l-phenylalanine, l-asparagine, l-glutamate,\
        \ l-glutamine, l-alanine and l-valine, as well as dipeptides including l-alanyl-l-threonine,\
        \ l-alanyl-l-glutamine, l-alanyl-l-histidine, glycyl-l-aspartate, glycyl-l-glutamine\
        \ and glycyl-l-proline. It tested negative for an ability to utilize glycyl-l-proline,\
        \ l-serine, l-aspartate or l-threonine as single carbon sources. The strain\
        \ is predicted to encode a tryptophanase (EC 4.1.99.1), indicating that it\
        \ has potential to hydrolyze tryptophan to indole. The strain tested negative\
        \ for utilization of propionate or hydroxybutyrate as sole carbon sources,\
        \ indicating that it may not consume these short-chain fatty acids in vivo.\
        \ The genome is 3,532,505 bp with a G + C content of 46.70 mol%. We propose\
        \ the name \u2018Sangeribacter muris\u2019 for this new species, reflecting\
        \ its high abundance and prevalence in mice and its initial isolation from\
        \ a murine host. The type strain is A43T (=CCUG 75085T)\\n\\n### BioLog analysis\\\
        n\\nIsolates were streaked on YCFA agar media and grown overnight. Cotton\
        \ swabs were used to remove colonies that were then inoculated into AN-IF\
        \ Inoculating Fluid (Technopath, no. 72007) to a turbidity of 65% using a\
        \ turbidimeter. Then, 100 \xB5l was pipetted into each well of Anaerobe AN\
        \ Microplates (Technopath, no. 1007) containing 95 different carbon sources.\
        \ The plates were sealed in PM Gas Bags (Technopath, no. 3032) and run on\
        \ the Omnilog system for 24 h. For each isolate, between three and five replicates\
        \ were run on different days from different starting colonies. Data were analyzed\
        \ using the CarboLogR application34. The quality-filtered CarboLogR output\
        \ is provided in Supplementary Table 2.\\n\\n### Reporting Summary\\n\\nFurther\
        \ information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting\
        \ Summary linked to this article.\\n\\n## Mouse models\\n\\nMice were maintained\
        \ under either germ-free or SPF conditions at the Wellcome Sanger Institute\
        \ Home Office-approved facility, with all procedures carried out in accordance\
        \ with the United Kingdom Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act of 1986 under\
        \ Home Office approval (PPL no. 80/2643). Germ-free mice were maintained in\
        \ positive-pressure isolators (Bell), with feces tested by culture, microscopy\
        \ and PCR to ensure sterility. Consumables were autoclaved at 121 \xB0C for\
        \ 15 min before introduction into the isolators. For experimentation, cages\
        \ were opened in a vaporized hydrogen peroxide-sterilized, class II cabinet\
        \ (Bioquell), with fecal transplant and monocolonized gnotobiotic lines generated\
        \ by weekly oral gavage over a 3-week period. Materials were prepared in Dulbecco\u2019\
        s PBS at 100 mg ml\u20131 immediately before administration under anaerobic\
        \ conditions (10% H, 10% CO2, 80% N) in a Whitley DG250 workstation at 37\
        \ \xB0C (ref. 8). Mice were maintained in sterile ISOcages (Tecniplast) and\
        \ housed on ISOrack for the period of the experiment.\\n\\n## DSS colitis\
        \ challenge\\n\\nDextran sulphate sodium was administered at a concentration\
        \ of 1.5% (w/v) (Affymetrix, Inc., average molecular weight 44 kDa) in drinking\
        \ water for 7 days, followed by 3 days with regular drinking water, to C57BL6/6N\
        \ mice aged 7\u201316 weeks (297 male, 282 female; median age 11 weeks; s.d.\
        \ 12 days). Mice were weighed every day and culled if weight loss reached\
        \ 20% of starting weight. Average weight loss curves were censored for each\
        \ group when the first member of the group reached this endpoint, to avoid\
        \ misleading calculations of the average using the remaining members. No statistical\
        \ methods were used to predetermine sample sizes in these experiments.\\n\\\
        n## Histological assessment of intestinal inflammation\\n\\nDextran sulphate\
        \ sodium-treated SPF mice were sacrificed at day 10 by cervical dislocation,\
        \ and samples from mid and distal colon taken. Tissue sections were fixed\
        \ in buffered 10% formalin, paraffin embedded, cut and stained with hematoxylin\
        \ and eosin (H&E). Colon histopathology was blind-graded semiquantitatively,\
        \ on a scale from zero to three, for four criteria: (1) degree of epithelial\
        \ hyperplasia/damage and goblet cell depletion; (2) leukocyte infiltration\
        \ in lamina propria; (3) area of tissue affected; and (4) presence of markers\
        \ of severe inflammation, including crypt abscesses, submucosal inflammation\
        \ and edema. Scores for individual criteria were added for an overall inflammation\
        \ score of between zero and 12 for each sample. Scores from mid and distal\
        \ colon were then averaged to obtain inflammation scores for each mouse colon.\\\
        n\\nMonocolonized, germ-free mice were euthanized 7 days after DSS administration\
        \ and samples taken from the cecum and midcolon. Tissue sections were fixed\
        \ in methacarn, paraffin embedded, sectioned and stained with H&E. Colon and\
        \ cecum histopathology was graded on a semiquantitative scale by a pathologist\
        \ blinded to the groups. The criteria scored were (1) degree of epithelial\
        \ hyperplasia/damage and goblet cell depletion; (2) severity of leukocyte\
        \ infiltration in lamina propria; (3) extent of inflammation; and (4) presence\
        \ of markers of severe inflammation, including crypt abscesses, submucosal\
        \ inflammation and edema. Each criterion was scored on a scale of zero to\
        \ three based on previously described thresholds28 and the sum of the individual\
        \ scores was recorded as an indication of overall inflammation. For all animal\
        \ experiments, treatments were randomized by cage by researchers blinded to\
        \ treatment conditions. For statistical analysis, distribution was assumed\
        \ to be normal but this was not formally tested\\n\\n## Bacterial culture\\\
        n\\nFecal samples and bacterial isolates were cultured for anaerobic gastrointestinal\
        \ bacteria under anaerobic conditions (10% H, 10% CO2, 80% N) in a Whitley\
        \ DG250 workstation at 37 \xB0C (ref. 8). Fecal samples were homogenized in\
        \ reduced PBS (0.1 g ml\u20131 PBS), serially diluted and plated directly\
        \ onto YCFA agar supplemented with 0.002 g ml\u22121 each of glucose, maltose\
        \ and cellobiose. Colonies were picked, restreaked to purity and identified\
        \ using 16 S rRNA gene sequencing.\\n\\n## Microbiota profiling and analysis\\\
        n\\nFecal samples were collected directly from mice and immediately stored\
        \ at \u221280 \xB0C until DNA extraction. DNA was extracted from samples using\
        \ the FastDNA Spin Kit for Soil (MPBio) and stored at \u221220 \xB0C until\
        \ metagenomic sequencing. DNA samples were quantified using a Qubit 4 Fluorometer\
        \ (Thermo Fisher). 16 S rRNA amplicon-based profiling was performed using\
        \ the FastDNA Spin Kit for Soil (MP Biomedicals) on 300 mg of fecal sample\
        \ from each mouse. The V1\u2013V2 region of 16 S rRNA genes was amplified\
        \ with a Q5 High-Fidelity Polymerase Kit (New England Biolabs): F': AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACAC-TATGGTAATT-CC-AGMGTTYGATYMTGGCTCAG;\
        \ R': CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGATACGAGACTGATTAGTCAGTCAGAAGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAG. Each\
        \ PCR amplification was performed as four independent amplifications and pooled\
        \ in equimolar amounts for 150-base-paired (bp)-end sequencing with the Illumina\
        \ MiSeq platform. For shotgun metagenomic sequencing, samples with >100 ng\
        \ of DNA material were processed onward to paired-end (2 \xD7 150 bp) metagenomics\
        \ sequencing on the HiSeq 4000 platform as per standard manufacturer library\
        \ preparation and sequencing protocols.\\n\\n## Metagenomic data analysis\\\
        n\\nAnalysis of 16 S rRNA amplicon sequences was performed with mothur MiSeq\
        \ SOP v.1.42.3 using SILVA v.132 (ref. 29). The 16 S rRNA gene alignments\
        \ were used to determine maximum likelihood phylogeny using FastTree v.2.1.10\
        \ (ref. 30). Phylogenetic trees were visualized and edited using iTOL31. Shotgun\
        \ metagenomic reads were filtered for quality and adapter sequences using\
        \ KneadData v.0.7.3, with default settings. Host reads were removed from samples\
        \ using the GRCm39 reference genome and Bowtie2 v.2.3.5. In addition, reads\
        \ were aligned to the Phi X 174 genome and removed. Taxonomic classification\
        \ of metagenomic reads was performed using Kraken2 v.2.0.8 and a custom database\
        \ built from the genomes of the Mouse Gut Bacterial Catalog (MGBC).\\n\\nAll\
        \ data analyses were performed in R v.4.0.2. Species abundant at \u22650.01%\
        \ reads were considered present in a sample, and operational taxonomic units\
        \ (OTUs) were considered statistically different at P < 0.05. For shotgun\
        \ metagenomic sequencing, relative abundance of species was corrected using\
        \ Bracken v.2.5.2. Bar plots for species prevalence data and sample numbers\
        \ were generated using the ggplot2 v.3.3.3 package. To quantify and visualize\
        \ intrainstitute abundance, species abundance data for each sample underwent\
        \ Bayesian multiplicative replacement of zero counts using the zCompositions\
        \ v.1.3.4 package, and the data transformed using center log-ratio normalization.\
        \ Mean abundance per sample was then calculated and visualized using the pheatmap\
        \ v.1.0.12 package. Principal component analyses were performed in R, and\
        \ linear regression analysis was performed using the linear regression function\
        \ in python scikit-learn v.0.20.4. Alpha diversity was assessed using Vegan\
        \ v.2.5.6 (ref. 30). Correlation analysis was performed using Spearman\u2019\
        s rank correlation coefficient.\\n\\n## Curation of public metagenome samples\\\
        n\\nTo assess the abundance of both health- and disease-associated bacteria\
        \ in mice from different institutes, we curated publicly available fecal shotgun\
        \ metagenomes for healthy, control SPF mice from NCBI and ENA. These samples\
        \ included mice from different genetic backgrounds and strains, but samples\
        \ were excluded if mice were younger than 3 weeks, had received antimicrobial\
        \ treatment or dietary intervention or had gene knockout. In total 582 fecal\
        \ shotgun metagenomes were curated.\\n\\n## qPCR of bacterial load\\n\\nAnaerostipes\
        \ faecis and D. muricolitica were quantified in the feces of SPF mice using\
        \ qPCR with custom primers. Primers were designed using the taxon-linked gene\
        \ catalog of MGBC32. Briefly, we identified gene targets that were both unique\
        \ to, and highly conserved in, the genome of each species. To ensure target\
        \ specificity, we selected gene clusters that shared <50% sequence identity\
        \ with all nontarget species sequences. Gene targets were defined as highly\
        \ conserved if they were identified in 100% of high-quality target species\
        \ genomes in the MGBC. Furthermore, only single-copy-number gene targets were\
        \ considered. Sequences for selected gene products were then clustered at\
        \ 90% sequence identity and used as templates for design of PCR primers with\
        \ NCBI Primer-BLAST33, ensuring specificity against the NCBI nonredundant\
        \ gene catalog. Two primers for each species were used in conjunction for\
        \ qPCR.\\n\\nPrimers: A14_1 (gene target: MGBC000029_00009), forward 5'-AGCTGTTCAGGTGTCTGATCTT-3',\
        \ reverse 5'-CGGTCCACTTCGCAGTATCA-3', product size 74 bp; A14_2 (gene target:\
        \ MGBC000029_00377), forward 5'-ATGCAGCACTGGGAGATTCA-3', reverse 5'-CTGCGTGTCCACAGAAGAGT-3',\
        \ product size 70 bp; A60_1 (gene target: MGBC109741_00862), forward 5'-CCATCTTTTCGGACGGTGGA-3',\
        \ reverse 5'-CGAGGTCTCCCTGAAACGAC-3', product size 125 bp; A60_2 (gene target:\
        \ MGBC140600_00802), forward 5'- AAAACGGTGACAGCTCGGAA-3', reverse 5'- GTCTCTTTTTGGCGGATGGG-3',\
        \ product size 93 bp.\\n\\nDNA was extracted from feces using FastDNA Spin\
        \ Kit for Soil (MPBio) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions,\
        \ and DNA eluted into 100 \xB5l of double-distilled H2O. Eluted DNA was then\
        \ diluted 1:50 and qPCR performed using SYBR Green chemistry (Thermo Fisher).\
        \ To approximate the relative abundance of target species in SPF feces, cycle\
        \ threshold values were normalized to those of a universal bacterial 16 S\
        \ primer (F: 5'- GTGSTGCAYGGYTGTCGTCA-3'; R: 5'- ACGTCRTCCMCACCTTCCTC-3').\\\
        n\\n## Intestinal immune cell isolation\\n\\nLarge intestines were excised\
        \ and separated from mesentery and fat. Transluminal sections were taken from\
        \ the cecum and distal colon for histology. The intestines were opened longitudinally,\
        \ cleared of feces then washed three times in cold PBS. To isolate intraepithelial\
        \ immune populations, the large intestines were cut into 1-cm pieces, washed\
        \ in cold PBS then incubated in 10 ml of PBS + 1 mM dithiothreitol for 10\
        \ min. Tissues were manually disrupted via shaking and then strained, with\
        \ supernatant then collected. Tissues were incubated in 10 ml of PBS + 30\
        \ mM EDTA + 10 ml of HEPES at 37 \xB0C and 200 r.p.m., before being shaken\
        \ and strained. The supernatants from these two steps were pooled, filtered\
        \ at 70 \xB5m and the filtrate fractionated using a discontinuous Percoll\
        \ gradient (80/40%). Epithelial cells were isolated from the surface of the\
        \ Percoll, and intraepithelial immune cells isolated from the interface.\\\
        n\\nTo access the lamina propria compartment, tissues were manually chopped\
        \ and digested in HBSS + 25 mM HEPES + 1 mM sodium pyruvate containing 0.05\
        \ mg ml\u20131 Collagenase VIII (Sigma) and 50 \xB5g ml\u20131 DNase I (Sigma)\
        \ for 1 h at 37 \xB0C and 80 r.p.m. Samples were mechanically disrupted and\
        \ filtered at 70 \xB5m. The filtrate was fractionated using a discontinuous\
        \ Percoll gradient (80/40%). Lamina propria immune cells were isolated from\
        \ the interface.\\n\\n## Flow cytometry\\n\\nIntestinal and mesenteric lymph\
        \ node immune cell populations were characterized by flow cytometry. For intracellular\
        \ cytokine staining, cells were incubated in T cell medium (RPMI, 10% FBS,\
        \ 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 2 mM GLUTamax, 1\xD7 nonessential amino acids, 0.1\
        \ mM 2-\u03B2-mercaptoethanol, 10 mM HEPES, 1% penicillin/streptomycin) +\
        \ 1\xD7 Cell Stimulation Cocktail with Protein Inhibitors (eBioscience) for\
        \ 3 h at 37 \xB0C before staining. Nonviable cells were stained using Live/Dead\
        \ Fixable Aqua. Cells were permeabilized with CytoFix/CytoPerm (BD), followed\
        \ by intracellular staining in PermBuffer (eBioscience).\\n\\nAll antibodies\
        \ were purchased from eBioscience unless otherwise indicated. Antibodies used\
        \ were CD45-SB600, TCRb-APC-Cy7, MHCII-FITC, CD4-PE-Cy7, CD8a-AF700, CD8b-PE,\
        \ IFNg-PerCP-Cy5.5, TNFa-APC, IL-17A-bv421 (BioLegend), CD3e-FITC, TCRg-FITC,\
        \ B220-FITC, MHCII-APC-e780, CD11b-PerCP-Cy5.5, CD11c-AF700, CD64-APC (BioLegend),\
        \ SiglecF-PE (BD), Ly6G-Pe-Cy7 (BD) and F4/80-e450. Sample data were acquired\
        \ with an Attune NxT flow cytometer coupled with an Attune CytKick Max autosampler.\
        \ Data were analyzed using FlowJo v.10. Antibody details and concentrations\
        \ are included in Supplementary Table 1.\\n\\n## Bacterial species characterization\\\
        n\\nWhile genomes are publicly available for the species described in this\
        \ paper, and are represented by genomic species clusters in the Genome Taxonomy\
        \ Database: A14 = Anaerostipes sp000508985 (GCF_000508985.1: 98.76% ANI),\
        \ A43 = CAG-485 sp002362485 (GCF_003833075.1: 98.66% ANI), A60 = Duncaniella\
        \ sp001689575 (GCF_003762875.1: 96.19% ANI), A61 = Alistipes sp002362235 (GCA_002362235.1:\
        \ 98.54% ANI)). These species have not yet been characterized, nor have these\
        \ names been validly published according to the International Code of Nomenclature\
        \ of Prokaryotes. Because these species are uncharacterized, they are referred\
        \ to as previously undescribed in this manuscript. Phenotypic data for the\
        \ capacity of each species to utilize 95 substrates as sole carbon sources\
        \ were attained using the BioLog platform (see BioLog analysis for a description\
        \ of methodology). Isolated genomes were functionally annotated using eggNOG-mapper\
        \ v.2 and InterProScan v.5. We describe these species and propose new names\
        \ below.\\n\\n### Description of \u2018Alistipes okayasuensis\u2019 sp. nov\\\
        n\\nAlistipes okayasuensis (o\u2019ka.ya.su.en.sis. N.L. masc./fem. adj. okayasuensis)\
        \ is named after Isao Okayasu, who first described DSS colitis as a model\
        \ for ulcerative colitis in mice. Phylogenomic analyses place strain A61T\
        \ in the Alistipes cluster. The digital DNA\u2013DNA hybridization (dDDH)\
        \ value between A. onderdonkii and A. putredinis is 24.4%, while dDDH values\
        \ between strain A61T, A. onderdonkii and A. putredinis are 25.2 and 21.4%,\
        \ respectively. The G + C content difference between the genome of strain\
        \ A61T and A. onderdonkii, its closest phylogenomic neighbor, is 1.39%, while\
        \ their 16S rRNA gene sequence identity is 96.03%. These analyses strongly\
        \ indicate that \u2018Alistipes okayasuensis\u2019 is a separate species within\
        \ the genus Alistipes.\\n\\nThis strain is a strict anaerobe. Carbon source\
        \ utilization analysis was combined with reconstruction of Kyoto Encyclopedia\
        \ of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) metabolic pathways (55.58% of 2,022 predicted\
        \ open reading frames (ORFs) could be annotated) to functionally characterize\
        \ the strain. The strain encodes 47 genes predicted to be carbohydrate-active\
        \ enzymes (CAZymes), including 29 glycoside hydrolases: seven beta-glucosidases\
        \ (GH3, EC 3.2.1.21); five beta-galactosidases (EC 3.2.1.23); five endohydrolytic\
        \ alpha-glucosidases (GH13), including four alpha-amylases (EC 3.2.1.1); three\
        \ exohydrolytic alpha-glucosidases (GH31, EC 3.2.1.20); three cellulases (EC\

        \ D. dubosii H5T is 28.10%, confirming a separate species status.\\n\\nRecent\
        \ work benchmarking an average nucleotide identity1 approach to define genus\

        \ 0.105/68.12; Prevotella melaninogenica, 0.195/72.07). The corresponding\
        \ values between A60T and the genus type species D. muris are 0.243/80.85,\
        \ providing further evidence that A60T belongs to the genus Duncaniella.\\\
        n\\nThe strain is an obligate anaerobe. Reconstruction of KEGG metabolic pathways\
        \ (47.2% of 3,461 predicted ORFs could be annotated) indicated that strain\
        \ is enriched for enzymes with glycoside hydrolase activity, encoding 47 in\
        \ total. The strain is able to utilize dextrin, beta-cyclodextrin and multiple\
        \ oligosaccharides including d-melezitose, maltotriose, amygdalin, maltose,\
        \ gentiobiose (EC: 3.2.1.21), turanose and d-cellobiose (EC: 2.4.1.20; EC:\
        \ 3.2.1.21). The strain is capable of utilizing d-raffinose, and is predicted\
        \ from its genome to produce sucrose as an intermediate (EC: 3.2.1.22, EC:\
        \ 3.2.1.20) rather than stachyose or melibiose. Additionally, the strain tested\
        \ negative for utilization of both stachyose and melibiose. In our study the\
        \ strain tested negative for an ability to utilize lactose as a single carbon\
        \ source, even though it encodes seven predicted beta-galactosidases (EC 3.2.1.23).\
        \ The strain is predicted to encode 36 glycosyltransferase enzymes, among\
        \ which are seven GT2 family enzymes including two dolichyl-phosphate beta-d-mannosyltransferases\
        \ (EC: 2.4.1.82).\\n\\nThe strain can utilize a variety of monosaccharides\
        \ as single carbon sources, including alpha-d-glucose, alpha-d-glucose 1-phosphate,\
        \ 3-methyl-d-glucose, d-galactose, alpha-methyl-d-galactose, d-mannose, adonitol,\
        \ arabinose, d-gluconate, d-arabitol and d-sorbitol. It tested negative for\
        \ an ability to utilize fucose, alpha-d-lactose, d-fructose, lactate, lactulose,\
        \ d-trehalose or l-rhamnose as sole carbon sources. The strain is predicted\
        \ to encode the pathway for metabolism of l-histidine to l-glutamate via 4-Imidazolone-5-phsophate\
        \ (EC 4.3.1.3, EC 4.2.1.49, EC 3.5.2.7, EC 2.1.2.5), and tested positive for\

        \ of 50.9 mol%. Following functional and genomic characterization of our isolate,\
        \ we propose the name \u2018Duncaniella muricolitica\u2019 for this species\
        \ in reference to its association with poor prognosis in the murine DSS model\
        \ of colitis. The type strain is A60T (=CCUG 75086T =DSM 112986T).\\n\\n##\

        \ established the importance of the microbiota in mediation of phenotypic\
        \ outcomes to DSS in genetically identical mice, we next sought to understand\
        \ the degree of variability in the mouse microbiota across a single facility,\
        \ and to define changes in the microbiota that occur with DSS treatment. Fecal\
        \ samples were collected before DSS treatment and 10 days after DSS exposure,\
        \ and subjected to taxonomic profiling with 16 S ribosomal RNA amplicon sequencing\
        \ to determine microbiota community composition. Consistent with previous\
        \ reports of gastrointestinal inflammation, this analysis demonstrated a clear\
        \ separation of microbiome community between pre- and post-DSS samples (Fig.\
        \ 2b,c and Extended Data Figs. 2 and 3) and a significant reduction in bacterial\
        \ diversity (Shannon diversity index, P = 0.0357; Fig. 2d)12. Although expansion\
        \ of Proteobacteria is often associated with gut microbiome dysbiosis, while\
        \ an increase in Proteobacteria was observed post DSS (P < 0.05, Kolmogorov\u2013\
        Smirnov test), limited association was observed between weight loss and Proteobacteria\
        \ proportion either pre (Fig. 2e; Spearman correlation, 0.196) or post DSS\
        \ treatment (Fig. 2e; Spearman correlation, \u22120.289). This suggests that\
        \ other gut bacteria may be contributing to the observed variation in DSS\
        \ resistance and susceptibility.Given the transmissibility of disease phenotype\
        \ we observed in the germ-free mouse experiments, we reasoned that the observed\
        \ phenotypic variation was primarily dependent on baseline microbiota composition\
        \ before DSS treatment. To understand the composition of microbiota associated\
        \ with increased risk of disease outcome, we applied linear discriminant analysis\
        \ to gut microbiota composition before and after DSS exposure24. This unsupervised\
        \ analysis leveraged the variability between mouse lineage-specific bacteria\
        \ to identify the bacterial taxa that most closely predict DSS response. Using\
        \ this approach, we identified two statistically different bacterial taxa\
        \ associated with no disease, and five statistically different bacterial taxa\
        \ associated with >5% weight loss. Notably, no relationship was observed between\
        \ the occurrence or abundance of these isolates in mice before DSS exposure,\
        \ and equivalent predictive bacterial taxa were not identified within the\
        \ microbiota of mice after DSS exposure. Our results suggest that the presence\
        \ of specific gut bacterial taxa before DSS exposure may influence disease\
        \ severity and outcome, possibly by either priming or protection from disease.Isolation\
        \ of bacterial species for functional validationWhile we show clear associations\
        \ between specific bacterial taxa and DSS-mediated disease outcome using 16\
        \ S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing, accurate taxonomic identification to strain\
        \ level and experimental validation require the isolation and genome sequencing\
        \ of pure clonal cultures of bacterial strains. To target and purify bacterial\
        \ strains, we next performed broad-based culture of ~2,000 bacterial colonies\
        \ from mouse fecal samples. The resulting isolates were identified by capillary\
        \ 16 S rRNA gene sequencing and included four previously identified bacterial\
        \ taxa, two \u2018disease associated\u2019 and two \u2018health associated\u2019\
        . These isolates were subjected to whole-genome sequencing and genomic analysis\
        \ to aid in precise taxonomic and phylogenetic assignment (Extended Data Fig.\
        \ 4). In addition, we performed extensive phenotypic characterization and\
        \ comparative genome analyses of these four species (Methods) as a basis to\
        \ provisionally name the health-associated bacteria Anaerostipes faecis and\
        \ Sangeribacter muris and the disease-associated bacteria Duncaniella muricolitica\
        \ and Alistipes okayasuensis; of note, the last three species are mouse specific.\
        \ Examination of the relative abundance of each of these species before DSS\
        \ treatment identified significantly higher levels of A. faecis (P = 0264,\
        \ t-test) and S. muris (P = 0.0010, t-test) in those mice without weight loss,\
        \ and significantly higher levels of D. muricolitica (P = 0.0351, t-test)\
        \ and A. okayasuensis (P = 0.0006, t-test) in mice that experienced >5% weight\
        \ loss (Fig. 2f).We next repeated the DSS experimental model in either germ-free\
        \ mice or germ-free mice stably monocolonized for 4 weeks with one of these\
        \ four bacterial strains (Extended Data Figs. 5a and 6). Control germ-free\
        \ mice treated with DSS neither lost weight (Fig. 3a) nor experienced mortality\
        \ (Fig. 3b) over the course of the experiment, suggesting that the presence\
        \ of gut bacteria is important in triggering overt disease in our facility.\
        \ Comparable experimental outcomes were observed in DSS-treated, germ-free\
        \ mice monocolonized with either of the health-associated bacteria, which\
        \ did not lose weight or develop intestinal pathology (Fig. 3a) nor experienced\
        \ significant mortality (Fig. 3b). In contrast, when DSS-treated mice were\
        \ monocolonized with either of the disease-associated bacteria, we observed\
        \ more rapid and greater weight loss (Fig. 3a) and significantly reduced survival\
        \ (Fig. 3b). Therefore, we identified and validated D. muricolitica and A.\
        \ okayasuensis as mouse bacteria that can promote disease not observed in\
        \ mice monocolonized with the commensal bacteria S. muris and A. faecis.Fig.\

        \ inflammatory immune responses in the intestine potentially caused by disease-associated\
        \ versus health-associated species, we next examined histology, immune cell\
        \ populations and cytokine production. The human-colonizing A. faecis and\
        \ the facility-prevalent D. muricolitica were chosen as exemplary disease-\
        \ and health-associated bacteria, respectively, for these analyses. Flow cytometric\
        \ analysis of intestinal lamina propria leukocytes isolated from germ-free\
        \ mice monocolonized for 4 weeks with either A. faecis or D. muricolitica\
        \ revealed that colonization with either strain did not significantly impact\
        \ the composition of intestinal leukocyte and lymphocyte subsets (Extended\
        \ Data Figs. 5b,c and 6). However, the perturbation and epithelial disruption\
        \ induced by DSS led to significantly increased inflammatory CD64+CD11c+ monocytes/macrophages\
        \ in the lamina propria compartment of the large intestine in D. muricolitica\
        \ monocolonized mice, but not in A. faecis monocolonized mice (Extended Data\
        \ Figs. 5c,d and 6). These monocytes have been shown to play a pathogenic\
        \ role in the intestine in the context of Helicobacter-induced inflammation25.\
        \ This suggests that, although neither pathogenic nor immunogenic at homeostasis,\
        \ D. muricolitica drives increased inflammatory responses in the wake of epithelial\
        \ damage whereas health-associated A. faecis does not. Importantly, while\
        \ histological samples taken after 7 days of DSS treatment from colons and\
        \ caeca of D. muricolitica monocolonized mice occasionally exhibited features\
        \ of severe inflammation, this was not statistically different from that of\
        \ A. faecis monocolonized mice (Fig. 3c,d) and did not consistently correspond\
        \ to the weight loss observed. This again suggests that weight loss in the\
        \ DSS model may not always correlate with intestinal inflammation and pathology.To\
        \ determine whether the presence of D. muricolitica or A. faecis had a positive\
        \ or negative correlation with weight change, we next examined 20 independent\
        \ mice and assessed the relationship between bacterial levels using quantitative\
        \ PCR (qPCR) before DSS treatment and weight change observed at day 10. This\
        \ analysis identified a positive correlation between weight change and pre-DSS\
        \ A. faecis abundance (R = 0.3679, P = 0.0046; Fig. 3e). Similarly, a negative\
        \ correlation was observed between weight change and D. muricolitica abundance\
        \ (R2 = 0.3626, P = 0.0050; Fig. 3e). This independent confirmation provides\
        \ further validation of the relationship between these species and the severity\
        \ of DSS colitis; however, additional work is needed to confirm their roles\
        \ as pathobionts.Global distribution and prevalence in other mouse facilitiesBecause\
        \ D. muricolitica and A. okayasuensis affected the outcome of DSS colitis\
        \ in our mouse facility, we next explored the presence and distribution of\
        \ these bacteria in other mouse facilities around the world. To do so, we\
        \ first generated a global representation of laboratory mouse intestinal microbiomes\
        \ by curating 582 publicly available shotgun metagenome samples from \u2018\
        control\u2019, SPF mice. We combined this dataset with shotgun metagenomes\
        \ from feces of 40 mice at the Wellcome Sanger Institute to yield a global\
        \ mouse gut microbiome dataset covering 31 institutes across 12 countries.\
        \ We then determined the prevalence and abundance of health-associated bacteria\
        \ S. muris and A. faecis and disease-associated bacteria D. muricolitica and\
        \ A. okayasuensis in this mouse microbiome dataset.Duncaniella muricolitica\
        \ and A. okayasuensis were both dominant members of the mouse microbiome,\
        \ present in 54.5 and 47.9% of samples and with a mean abundance of 0.52 and\
        \ 0.48% reads per sample, respectively. Importantly, D. muricolitica and A.\
        \ okayasuensis were each detected in 80.6% (25/31) of the institutes included\
        \ in the analyses (Fig. 4), and there were only three institutes that did\
        \ not contain either of these species. For comparison, among health-associated\
        \ species S. muris was the most dominant in the mouse gut microbiota, present\
        \ in 96.5% of samples with a mean abundance of 6.2% reads, while A. faecis\
        \ was a relatively minor species, present in 5.9% of samples with a mean abundance\
        \ of 0.22% reads. S. muris was present in all (31/31) of the institutes included\
        \ in the analyses, whereas A. faecis was detected in 25.8% (8/31). The abundance\
        \ of each species also differed between institutes (Fig. 4). Thus, we show\
        \ that mouse-derived bacteria cultured from our institute are common mouse\
        \ symbionts and, importantly, D. muricolitica and A. okayasuensis are common,\
        \ but not ubiquitous, in animal facilities around the world.Fig. 4Global epidemiology\

        ,\"discussion\":\"DiscussionDespite experimental variability in the DSS mouse\
        \ model, which limits the interpretation and translation of data, the model\
        \ is increasingly used in basic research (>6,000 DSS model publications on\
        \ PubMed) and by the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. Cohousing,\
        \ heterozygote mating and other experimental procedures have been used in\
        \ an attempt to normalize the microbiota within experiments and ensure direct\
        \ measures of the effects of mouse genetic background on disease phenotype\
        \ rather than indirect and unknown microbiota-associated effects26. In our\
        \ approach we leveraged this variability in DSS outcome, in combination with\
        \ microbiome analysis, machine learning, anerobic culturing and germ-free\
        \ mouse validation experiments, to gain relevant biological insight into microbiota\
        \ determinants of DSS disease. While this consideration of the microbiome\
        \ did not completely eliminate the impact of multidimensionality in the DSS\
        \ model, we identified and undertook experimental validation of D. muricolitica\
        \ and A. okayasuensis, both of which have a dominant effect on DSS outcome.Interestingly,\
        \ D. muricolitica and A. okayasuensis are phylogenetically distinct from each\
        \ other and neither had computationally predicted virulence factors within\
        \ their genome. While it remains unclear how these isolates contribute to\
        \ DSS disease, both exhibit a potential for polysaccharide utilization that\
        \ may mediate this relationship through interaction with the mucus layer.\
        \ We also noted that weight loss and intestinal pathology do not always correlate,\
        \ so they should not necessarily be used as surrogates for each other. Similarly,\
        \ substantial weight loss was observed in monocolonized mice even in the absence\
        \ of severe inflammation, suggesting that activation of key pathways alone\
        \ can have a substantial impact on experimental outcome. Together, these insights\
        \ raise the need for further experimental study of host interactions and the\
        \ biology of these important mouse-specific bacteria.We propose that researchers\
        \ should consider monitoring for D. muricolitica and A. okayasuensis in their\
        \ mouse facilities, as is undertaken for other immunophenotyped-affecting\
        \ microbes such as segmented filamentous bacteria27. In some cases, precolonization\
        \ of animals with these bacteria, if they are not present in the facility,\
        \ may yield better experimental control and increase confidence in this important\
        \ and widely used mouse model of human disease. Overall, our work suggests\
        \ that the application of metagenomics techniques to report microbiota composition,\
        \ in addition to the genetic and disease phenotypes being described, should\
        \ represent a standard minimum requirement for the DSS mouse model. We have\
        \ deposited the D. muricolitis, A. okayasuensis, S. muris and A. faecis strains\
        \ and genomes in public repositories to support this work.\",\"methods\":\"\

        \ with default settings. Host reads were removed from samples using the GRCm39\
        \ reference genome and Bowtie2 v.2.3.5. In addition, reads were aligned to\
        \ the Phi X 174 genome and removed. Taxonomic classification of metagenomic\
        \ reads was performed using Kraken2 v.2.0.8 and a custom database built from\
        \ the genomes of the Mouse Gut Bacterial Catalog (MGBC).All data analyses\

        \ replacement of zero counts using the zCompositions v.1.3.4 package, and\
        \ the data transformed using center log-ratio normalization. Mean abundance\

        \ had received antimicrobial treatment or dietary intervention or had gene\
        \ knockout. In total 582 fecal shotgun metagenomes were curated.qPCR of bacterial\
        \ loadAnaerostipes faecis and D. muricolitica were quantified in the feces\
        \ of SPF mice using qPCR with custom primers. Primers were designed using\
        \ the taxon-linked gene catalog of MGBC32. Briefly, we identified gene targets\
        \ that were both unique to, and highly conserved in, the genome of each species.\
        \ To ensure target specificity, we selected gene clusters that shared <50%\
        \ sequence identity with all nontarget species sequences. Gene targets were\
        \ defined as highly conserved if they were identified in 100% of high-quality\
        \ target species genomes in the MGBC. Furthermore, only single-copy-number\
        \ gene targets were considered. Sequences for selected gene products were\
        \ then clustered at 90% sequence identity and used as templates for design\
        \ of PCR primers with NCBI Primer-BLAST33, ensuring specificity against the\
        \ NCBI nonredundant gene catalog. Two primers for each species were used in\
        \ conjunction for qPCR.Primers: A14_1 (gene target: MGBC000029_00009), forward\

        \ according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions, and DNA eluted into 100\
        \ \xB5l of double-distilled H2O. Eluted DNA was then diluted 1:50 and qPCR\
        \ performed using SYBR Green chemistry (Thermo Fisher). To approximate the\
        \ relative abundance of target species in SPF feces, cycle threshold values\
        \ were normalized to those of a universal bacterial 16 S primer (F: 5'- GTGSTGCAYGGYTGTCGTCA-3';\

        \ were excised and separated from mesentery and fat. Transluminal sections\
        \ were taken from the cecum and distal colon for histology. The intestines\
        \ were opened longitudinally, cleared of feces then washed three times in\
        \ cold PBS. To isolate intraepithelial immune populations, the large intestines\
        \ were cut into 1-cm pieces, washed in cold PBS then incubated in 10 ml of\
        \ PBS + 1 mM dithiothreitol for 10 min. Tissues were manually disrupted via\

        \ 200 r.p.m., before being shaken and strained. The supernatants from these\
        \ two steps were pooled, filtered at 70 \xB5m and the filtrate fractionated\
        \ using a discontinuous Percoll gradient (80/40%). Epithelial cells were isolated\
        \ from the surface of the Percoll, and intraepithelial immune cells isolated\
        \ from the interface.To access the lamina propria compartment, tissues were\

        \ \u2018Alistipes okayasuensis\u2019 sp. novAlistipes okayasuensis (o\u2019\
        ka.ya.su.en.sis. N.L. masc./fem. adj. okayasuensis) is named after Isao Okayasu,\
        \ who first described DSS colitis as a model for ulcerative colitis in mice.\
        \ Phylogenomic analyses place strain A61T in the Alistipes cluster. The digital\
        \ DNA\u2013DNA hybridization (dDDH) value between A. onderdonkii and A. putredinis\
        \ is 24.4%, while dDDH values between strain A61T, A. onderdonkii and A. putredinis\
        \ are 25.2 and 21.4%, respectively. The G + C content difference between the\
        \ genome of strain A61T and A. onderdonkii, its closest phylogenomic neighbor,\
        \ is 1.39%, while their 16S rRNA gene sequence identity is 96.03%. These analyses\
        \ strongly indicate that \u2018Alistipes okayasuensis\u2019 is a separate\
        \ species within the genus Alistipes.This strain is a strict anaerobe. Carbon\
        \ source utilization analysis was combined with reconstruction of Kyoto Encyclopedia\
        \ of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) metabolic pathways (55.58% of 2,022 predicted\
        \ open reading frames (ORFs) could be annotated) to functionally characterize\
        \ the strain. The strain encodes 47 genes predicted to be carbohydrate-active\
        \ enzymes (CAZymes), including 29 glycoside hydrolases: seven beta-glucosidases\
        \ (GH3, EC 3.2.1.21); five beta-galactosidases (EC 3.2.1.23); five endohydrolytic\
        \ alpha-glucosidases (GH13), including four alpha-amylases (EC 3.2.1.1); three\
        \ exohydrolytic alpha-glucosidases (GH31, EC 3.2.1.20); three cellulases (EC\
        \ 3.2.1.4); three mannan endo-1,4-beta-mannosidases (EC 3.2.1.78); and an\
        \ alpha-l-fucosidase (EC 3.2.1.51). Despite this predicted hydrolytic potential,\
        \ the strain shows limited capacity to utilize disaccharides and oligosaccharides\
        \ as sole carbon sources. While the strain tested positive for utilization\
        \ of alpha-d-lactose, sucrose and maltotriose, it tested negative for utilization\
        \ of d-cellobiose, dextrin, cyclodextrin, gentiobiose, lactulose, maltose,\
        \ d-melezitose, d-melibiose, palatinose, d-raffinose, stachyose, d-trehalose,\
        \ fucose or turanose.The strain is predicted to encode enzymes for metabolism\
        \ of l-histidine to l-glutamate via 4-Imidazolone-5-phsophate (EC 4.3.1.3,\
        \ EC 4.2.1.49, EC 3.5.2.7, EC 2.1.2.5). In support of these predictions, the\
        \ strain is capable of utilizing urocanate as a sole carbon source. In keeping\
        \ with other members of the genus Alistipes, this strain is predicted to encode\
        \ a putative tryptophanase (EC 4.1.99.1) that would allow it to hydrolyze\
        \ tryptophan to indole. The strain is also predicted to encode a butyrate\
        \ phosphotransferase (EC 2.3.1.19) and a butyrate kinase (EC 2.7.2.7), indicating\
        \ its potential to metabolize butyrate. The genome is 2,329,524 bp with a\
        \ G + C content of 56.45 mol%. We propose the name \u2018Alistipes okayasuensis\u2019\
        \ for this previously undescribed species, in reference to the origins of\
        \ the DSS colitis model and reflecting this species\u2019 association with\
        \ poor outcomes of this disease model. The type strain is A61T (=CCUG 75087T\
        \ =SM 112987T).Description of \u2018Anaerostipes faecis\u2019 sp. novAnaerostipes\
        \ faecis (fae\u2019cis. L. gen. fem. n. faecis, of feces, referring to fecal\
        \ origin). The closest phylogenomic neighbor of strain A14T is Anaerostipes\
        \ caccae, with a dDDH value of 48.40%. The pairwise 16 S rRNA gene sequence\
        \ identity of A14T and A. caccae DSM 14662T is 98.16%. These analyses indicate\
        \ that A14T is a separate species within the genus Anaerostipes. The genome\
        \ is 3,200,246 bp with a G + C content of 43.77 mol%. We propose the name\
        \ \u2018Anaerostipes faecis\u2019 for this new species. The type strain is\
        \ A14T (=CCUG 75084T).The strain is strictly anaerobic. Reconstruction of\
        \ KEGG metabolic pathways (55.4% of 3,222 predicted ORFs could be annotated)\
        \ indicates that the strain can produce butyrate via a butyrate phosphotransferase/butyrate\
        \ kinase operon (EC 2.7.2.7, EC 2.3.1.91), in keeping with the genus type\
        \ species A. caccae. Likewise, the strain is predicted to encode an arginine\
        \ dihydrolase (EC 3.5.3.6). In contrast to the genus description, however,\
        \ this strain is predicted to encode neither an alpha-galactosidase (EC 3.2.1.22)\
        \ nor a phosphoamidase (EC 3.9.1.1).The strain shows limited capacity to utilize\
        \ monosaccharides as sole carbon sources: it had a robust phenotype for utilization\
        \ of 3-methyl-d-glucose but tested negative for its ability to utilize other\
        \ monosaccharides including d-fructose, d-galactose, d-mannose or d-glucose\
        \ as sole carbon sources. Notably, the strain is predicted to encode the complete\
        \ Leloir pathway for galactose metabolism, as well as multiple beta-galactosidases\
        \ (EC 3.2.1.23), indicating that it might lack a galactose transporter but\
        \ could metabolize galactose in different contexts such as downstream of other\
        \ pathways of carbohydrate metabolism. The strain can utilize some disaccharides,\
        \ testing positive for sucrose utilization, potentially via multiple oligo-1,6-glucosidases\
        \ (EC 3.2.1.10), d-trehalose utilization, potentially via three trehalases\
        \ (EC 3.2.1.28, GH37, GH65) and turanose utilization. However, the strain\
        \ tested negative for its ability to utilize alpha-d-lactose, lactulose, maltose,\
        \ d-melibiose, gentiobiose, d-cellobiose or palatinose. Additionally, the\
        \ strain tested negative for utilization of the trisccharides maltotriose,\
        \ d-melezitose and d-raffinose and the tetrasaccharide stachyose\u2014potentially\
        \ due to the absence of a predicted alpha-galactosidase. The strain could\
        \ utilize beta-cyclodextrin, but tested negative for utilization of dextrin\
        \ and alpha-cyclodextrin. The strain is capable of utilizing alpha-ketovaleric\
        \ acid and d-malic acid, as well as certain amino acids and derivatives including\
        \ l-threonine, l-asparagine, l-serine and the dipeptides glycyl-l-proline\
        \ and l-alanyl-l-threonine. The strain tested negative for utilization of\
        \ l-glutamine, l-glutamate, l-valine and l-alanine.Description of \u2018Duncaniella\
        \ muricolitica\u2019 sp. novDuncaniella muricolitica (mu.ri.co\u2019li.ti.ca.\

        \ -on, suffix used with the sense of pertaining to; N.L. fem. adj. muricolitica,\
        \ pertaining to the colon of the mouse). The closest phylogenetic neighbor,\
        \ according to pairwise 16 S rRNA gene analyses, is Duncaniella dubosii with\
        \ a sequence identity of 94.04%. The 16 S gene sequence identity values between\
        \ D. dubosii H5T and other species of the genus, D. muris DSM 103720T and\
        \ D. freteri TLL-A3T, are 95.14 and 93.00%, respectively, indicating that\
        \ A60T is a separate species within the Duncaniella cluster. The dDDH value\
        \ between A60T and D. dubosii H5T is 28.10%, confirming a separate species\
        \ status.Recent work benchmarking an average nucleotide identity1 approach\
        \ to define genus boundaries found that the genus inflection points of members\
        \ of the order Bacteroidales had relatively low values for alignment fraction\
        \ (AF) and ANI (AF/ANI: Bacteroides fragilis, 0.215/71.23; Porphyromonas asaccharolytica,\
        \ 0.105/68.12; Prevotella melaninogenica, 0.195/72.07). The corresponding\
        \ values between A60T and the genus type species D. muris are 0.243/80.85,\
        \ providing further evidence that A60T belongs to the genus Duncaniella.The\
        \ strain is an obligate anaerobe. Reconstruction of KEGG metabolic pathways\
        \ (47.2% of 3,461 predicted ORFs could be annotated) indicated that strain\
        \ is enriched for enzymes with glycoside hydrolase activity, encoding 47 in\
        \ total. The strain is able to utilize dextrin, beta-cyclodextrin and multiple\
        \ oligosaccharides including d-melezitose, maltotriose, amygdalin, maltose,\
        \ gentiobiose (EC: 3.2.1.21), turanose and d-cellobiose (EC: 2.4.1.20; EC:\
        \ 3.2.1.21). The strain is capable of utilizing d-raffinose, and is predicted\
        \ from its genome to produce sucrose as an intermediate (EC: 3.2.1.22, EC:\
        \ 3.2.1.20) rather than stachyose or melibiose. Additionally, the strain tested\
        \ negative for utilization of both stachyose and melibiose. In our study the\
        \ strain tested negative for an ability to utilize lactose as a single carbon\
        \ source, even though it encodes seven predicted beta-galactosidases (EC 3.2.1.23).\
        \ The strain is predicted to encode 36 glycosyltransferase enzymes, among\
        \ which are seven GT2 family enzymes including two dolichyl-phosphate beta-d-mannosyltransferases\
        \ (EC: 2.4.1.82).The strain can utilize a variety of monosaccharides as single\
        \ carbon sources, including alpha-d-glucose, alpha-d-glucose 1-phosphate,\
        \ 3-methyl-d-glucose, d-galactose, alpha-methyl-d-galactose, d-mannose, adonitol,\
        \ arabinose, d-gluconate, d-arabitol and d-sorbitol. It tested negative for\
        \ an ability to utilize fucose, alpha-d-lactose, d-fructose, lactate, lactulose,\
        \ d-trehalose or l-rhamnose as sole carbon sources. The strain is predicted\
        \ to encode the pathway for metabolism of l-histidine to l-glutamate via 4-Imidazolone-5-phsophate\
        \ (EC 4.3.1.3, EC 4.2.1.49, EC 3.5.2.7, EC 2.1.2.5), and tested positive for\
        \ utilization of urocanate. The genome is 4,055,027 bp with a G + C content\
        \ of 50.9 mol%. Following functional and genomic characterization of our isolate,\
        \ we propose the name \u2018Duncaniella muricolitica\u2019 for this species\
        \ in reference to its association with poor prognosis in the murine DSS model\
        \ of colitis. The type strain is A60T (=CCUG 75086T =DSM 112986T).Description\

              \ of a 44-year-old woman who suffered from pelvic peritonitis. This\
              \ strain exhibited a 16S rRNA sequence similarity of 94.8 % 16S rRNA\
              \ sequence identity with Haemophilus parasuis, the phylogenetically\
              \ closest species with a name with standing in nomenclature and a poor\
              \ MALDI-TOF MS score (1.32 to 1.56) that does not allow any reliable\
              \ identification. Using a polyphasic study made of phenotypic and genomic\
              \ analyses, strain FF7T was a Gram-negative, facultatively anaerobic\
              \ rod and member of the family Pasteurellaceae. It exhibited a genome\
              \ of 2,442,548 bp long genome (one chromosome but no plasmid) contains\
              \ 2,319 protein-coding and 67 RNA genes, including 6 rRNA operons. On\
              \ the basis of these data, we propose the creation of Haemophilus massiliensis\
              \ sp. nov. with strain FF7T (= CSUR P859 = DSM 28247) as the type strain.\\\

              \ (doi:10.1186/s40793-016-0150-1) contains supplementary material, which\
              \ is available to authorized users.\\n\\n## Introduction\\n\\nThe genus\
              \ Haemophilus (Winslow et al. 1917) was described in 1917 [1] and currently\
              \ meningitis, bacteremia, sinusitis, and/or pneumonia [2].\\n\\nThe\
              \ current taxonomic classification of prokaryotes relies on a combination\
              \ of phenotypic and genotypic characteristics [3, 4]; including 16S\
              \ rRNA sequence similarity, G + C content and DNA-DNA hybridization.\
              \ However, these tools suffer from various drawbacks, mainly due to\
              \ their threshold values that are not applicable to all species or genera\
              \ [5, 6]. With the development of cost-effective, high-throughput sequencing\
              \ techniques, dozens of thousands of bacterial genome sequences have\
              \ been made available in public databases [7]. Recently, we developed\
              \ a strategy named taxono-genomics in which genomic and phenotypic characteristics,\
              \ notably the MALDI-TOF-MS spectrum, are systematically compared to\
              \ the phylogenetically-closest species with a name with standing in\
              \ nomenclature [8, 9].\\n\\nThe strain FF7T was isolated from the peritoneal\
              \ fluid of a Senegalese woman suffering from pelvic peritonitis complicating\
              \ a ruptured ovarian abscess. She was admitted to H\xF4pital Principal\
              \ in Dakar, Senegal. Haemophilus massiliensis is a Gram-negative, facultatively\
              \ anaerobic, oxidase and catalase-positive and non-motile rod shaped\
              \ bacterium. This microorganism was cultivated as part of the MALDI-TOF-MS\
              \ implementation in H\xF4pital Principal in Dakar, aiming at improving\
              \ the routine laboratory identification of bacterial strains in Senegal\
              \ [10].\\n\\nHere, we present a summary classification and a set of\
              \ features for Haemophilus massiliensis sp. nov. together with the description\
              \ of the complete genome sequencing and annotation. These characteristics\
              \ support the circumscription of the species Haemophilus massiliensis.\\\

              nIn June 2013, a bacterial strain (Table 1) was isolated by cultivation\
              \ on 5 % sheep blood-enriched Columbia agar (BioM\xE9rieux, Marcy l'Etoile,\
              \ France) of a peritoneal fluid specimen obtained from a 44-year-old\
              \ Senegalese woman who suffered from pelvic peritonitis that had complicated\
              \ a ruptured ovarian abscess [10] and hospitalized in H\xF4pital Principal\
              \ de Dakar, Senegal. The strain could not be identified using MALDI-TOF-MS.\
              \ Strain FF7T exhibited a 94.8 % 16S rRNA sequence identity with Haemophilus\
              \ parasuis strain ATCC 19417T (GenBank accession number AY362909), the\
              \ phylogenetically-closest bacterial species with a validly published\
              \ name (Fig. 1). These values were lower than the 98.7 % 16S rRNA gene\
              \ sequence threshold recommended by Meier-Kolthoff et al., 2013 to delineate\
              \ a new species within phylum Proteobacteria without carrying out wet\

              \ preparation\\n\\nHaemophilus massiliensis sp. nov., strain FF7T (=\
              \ CSUR P859= DSM 28247) was grown aerobically on 5 % sheep blood-enriched\
              \ Columbia agar (BioM\xE9rieux) at 37 \xB0C. Bacteria grown on four\
              \ Petri dishes were resuspended in 5x100 \u03BCL of TE buffer; 150 \u03BC\
              L of this suspension was diluted in 350 \u03BCL TE buffer 10X, 25 \u03BC\
              L proteinase K and 50 \u03BCL sodium dodecyl sulfate for lysis treatment.\
              \ This preparation was incubated overnight at 56 \xB0C. Extracted DNA\
              \ was purified using 3 successive phenol-chloroform extractions and\
              \ ethanol precipitations. Following centrifugation, the DNA was suspended\
              \ in 65 \u03BCL EB buffer. The genomic DNA (gDNA) concentration was\
              \ measured at 14.7 ng/\u03BCl using the Qubit assay with the high sensitivity\
              \ kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA).\\n\\n### Genome sequencing\
              \ and assembly\\n\\nGenomic DNA of Haemophilus massiliensis FF7T was\
              \ sequenced on the MiSeq sequencer (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) with\
              \ the Mate-Pair strategy. The gDNA was barcoded in order to be mixed\
              \ with 11 other projects with the Nextera Mate-Pair sample prep kit\
              \ (Illumina). The Mate-Pair library was prepared with 1 \u03BCg of genomic\
              \ DNA using the Nextera Mate-Pair Illumina guide. The gDNA sample was\
              \ simultaneously fragmented and tagged with a Mate-Pair junction adapter.\
              \ The pattern of the fragmentation was validated on an Agilent 2100\
              \ BioAnalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) with a DNA\
              \ 7500 labchip. The DNA fragments ranged in size from 1 kb up to 10\
              \ kb with an optimal size at 4.08 kb. No size selection was performed\
              \ and only 464 ng of tagmented fragments were circularized. The circularized\
              \ DNA was mechanically sheared to small fragments with an optimal at\
              \ 569 bp on the Covaris S2 device in microtubes (Covaris, Woburn, MA,\
              \ USA). The library profile was visualized on a High Sensitivity Bioanalyzer\
              \ LabChip (Agilent Technologies) and the final library concentration\
              \ was measured at 24.42 nmol/L. The libraries were normalized at 2nM\
              \ and pooled. After a denaturation step and dilution at 15 pM, the pool\
              \ of libraries was loaded onto the reagent cartridge and then onto the\
              \ instrument along with the flow cell. Automated cluster generation\
              \ and sequencing run were performed in a single 39-h-run in a 2x251-bp.\
              \ Total information of 10.1Gb was obtained from a 1,189 K/mm2 cluster\
              \ density with a cluster passing quality control filters of 99.1 % (22,579,000\
              \ clusters). Within this run, the index representation for Haemophilus\
              \ massiliensis was 9.72 %. The 1,976,771 paired reads were filtered\
              \ according to the read qualities. These reads were trimmed, then assembled\
              \ using the CLC genomicsWB4 software. Finally, the draft genome of Haemophilusmassiliensis\
              \ consists of 9 scaffolds with 46 contigs and generated a genome size\
              \ of 2.4 Mb with a 46.0 % G + C content.\\n\\n### Genome annotation\\\
              n\\nOpen Reading Frames were predicted using Prodigal [14] with default\
              \ parameters but the predicted ORFs were excluded if they spanned a\
              \ sequencing gap region. The predicted bacterial protein sequences were\
              \ searched against the GenBank database [15] and the Clusters of Orthologous\
              \ Groups databases using BLASTP. The tRNAScanSE tool [16] was used to\
              \ find tRNA genes, whereas ribosomal RNAs were found using RNAmmer [17]\
              \ and BLASTn against the GenBank database. Lipoprotein signal peptides\
              \ and the number of transmembrane helices were predicted using SignalP\
              \ [18] and TMHMM [19] respectively. ORFans were identified if their\
              \ BLASTP E-value was lower than 1e-03 for alignment length greater than\
              \ 80 amino acids. If alignment lengths were smaller than 80 amino acids,\
              \ we used an E-value of 1e-05. Such parameter thresholds have already\
              \ been used in previous works to define ORFans. Artemis [20] was used\
              \ for data management and DNA Plotter [21] for visualization of genomic\
              \ features. The Mauve alignment tool (version 2.3.1) was used for multiple\
              \ genomic sequence alignment [22]. To estimate the mean level of nucleotide\
              \ sequence similarity at the genome level, we used the AGIOS home-made\
              \ software [9]. Briefly, this software combines the Proteinortho software\
              \ [23] for detecting orthologous proteins in pairwise genomic comparisons,\
              \ then retrieves the corresponding genes and determines the mean percentage\
              \ of nucleotide sequence identity among orthologous ORFs using the Needleman-Wunsch\
              \ global alignment algorithm. The script created to calculate AGIOS\
              \ values was named MAGi and is written in perl and bioperl modules.\

        \ H\xF4pital Principal de Dakar, Senegal. The strain could not be identified\

        \ with Haemophilus parasuis strain ATCC 19417T (GenBank accession number AY362909),\
        \ the phylogenetically-closest bacterial species with a validly published\
        \ name (Fig. 1). These values were lower than the 98.7 % 16S rRNA gene sequence\
        \ threshold recommended by Meier-Kolthoff et al., 2013 to delineate a new\
        \ species within phylum Proteobacteria without carrying out wet lab or digital\

        \ massiliensis sp. nov., strain FF7T (= CSUR P859= DSM 28247) was grown aerobically\
        \ on 5 % sheep blood-enriched Columbia agar (BioM\xE9rieux) at 37 \xB0C. Bacteria\
        \ grown on four Petri dishes were resuspended in 5x100 \u03BCL of TE buffer;\
        \ 150 \u03BCL of this suspension was diluted in 350 \u03BCL TE buffer 10X,\
        \ 25 \u03BCL proteinase K and 50 \u03BCL sodium dodecyl sulfate for lysis\
        \ treatment. This preparation was incubated overnight at 56 \xB0C. Extracted\
        \ DNA was purified using 3 successive phenol-chloroform extractions and ethanol\
        \ precipitations. Following centrifugation, the DNA was suspended in 65 \u03BC\
        L EB buffer. The genomic DNA (gDNA) concentration was measured at 14.7 ng/\u03BC\
        l using the Qubit assay with the high sensitivity kit (Life Technologies,\
        \ Carlsbad, CA, USA).\\n\\n### Genome sequencing and assembly\\n\\nGenomic\
        \ DNA of Haemophilus massiliensis FF7T was sequenced on the MiSeq sequencer\
        \ (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) with the Mate-Pair strategy. The gDNA was\
        \ barcoded in order to be mixed with 11 other projects with the Nextera Mate-Pair\
        \ sample prep kit (Illumina). The Mate-Pair library was prepared with 1 \u03BC\
        g of genomic DNA using the Nextera Mate-Pair Illumina guide. The gDNA sample\
        \ was simultaneously fragmented and tagged with a Mate-Pair junction adapter.\
        \ The pattern of the fragmentation was validated on an Agilent 2100 BioAnalyzer\
        \ (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) with a DNA 7500 labchip. The\
        \ DNA fragments ranged in size from 1 kb up to 10 kb with an optimal size\
        \ at 4.08 kb. No size selection was performed and only 464 ng of tagmented\
        \ fragments were circularized. The circularized DNA was mechanically sheared\
        \ to small fragments with an optimal at 569 bp on the Covaris S2 device in\
        \ microtubes (Covaris, Woburn, MA, USA). The library profile was visualized\
        \ on a High Sensitivity Bioanalyzer LabChip (Agilent Technologies) and the\
        \ final library concentration was measured at 24.42 nmol/L. The libraries\
        \ were normalized at 2nM and pooled. After a denaturation step and dilution\
        \ at 15 pM, the pool of libraries was loaded onto the reagent cartridge and\
        \ then onto the instrument along with the flow cell. Automated cluster generation\
        \ and sequencing run were performed in a single 39-h-run in a 2x251-bp. Total\
        \ information of 10.1Gb was obtained from a 1,189 K/mm2 cluster density with\
        \ a cluster passing quality control filters of 99.1 % (22,579,000 clusters).\
        \ Within this run, the index representation for Haemophilus massiliensis was\
        \ 9.72 %. The 1,976,771 paired reads were filtered according to the read qualities.\
        \ These reads were trimmed, then assembled using the CLC genomicsWB4 software.\
        \ Finally, the draft genome of Haemophilusmassiliensis consists of 9 scaffolds\
        \ with 46 contigs and generated a genome size of 2.4 Mb with a 46.0 % G +\
        \ C content.\\n\\n### Genome annotation\\n\\nOpen Reading Frames were predicted\
        \ using Prodigal [14] with default parameters but the predicted ORFs were\
        \ excluded if they spanned a sequencing gap region. The predicted bacterial\
        \ protein sequences were searched against the GenBank database [15] and the\
        \ Clusters of Orthologous Groups databases using BLASTP. The tRNAScanSE tool\
        \ [16] was used to find tRNA genes, whereas ribosomal RNAs were found using\
        \ RNAmmer [17] and BLASTn against the GenBank database. Lipoprotein signal\
        \ peptides and the number of transmembrane helices were predicted using SignalP\
        \ [18] and TMHMM [19] respectively. ORFans were identified if their BLASTP\
        \ E-value was lower than 1e-03 for alignment length greater than 80 amino\
        \ acids. If alignment lengths were smaller than 80 amino acids, we used an\
        \ E-value of 1e-05. Such parameter thresholds have already been used in previous\
        \ works to define ORFans. Artemis [20] was used for data management and DNA\
        \ Plotter [21] for visualization of genomic features. The Mauve alignment\
        \ tool (version 2.3.1) was used for multiple genomic sequence alignment [22].\
        \ To estimate the mean level of nucleotide sequence similarity at the genome\
        \ level, we used the AGIOS home-made software [9]. Briefly, this software\
        \ combines the Proteinortho software [23] for detecting orthologous proteins\
        \ in pairwise genomic comparisons, then retrieves the corresponding genes\
        \ and determines the mean percentage of nucleotide sequence identity among\
        \ orthologous ORFs using the Needleman-Wunsch global alignment algorithm.\
        \ The script created to calculate AGIOS values was named MAGi and is written\
        \ in perl and bioperl modules. GGDC analysis was also performed using the\
        \ GGDC web server as previously reported [24, 25].\\n\\n## Genome project\

        \ 9.72 %. The 1,976,771 paired reads were filtered according to the read qualities.\
        \ These reads were trimmed, then assembled using the CLC genomicsWB4 software.\
        \ Finally, the draft genome of Haemophilusmassiliensis consists of 9 scaffolds\
        \ with 46 contigs and generated a genome size of 2.4 Mb with a 46.0 % G +\
        \ C content.\\n\\n## Genome annotation\\n\\nOpen Reading Frames were predicted\
        \ using Prodigal [14] with default parameters but the predicted ORFs were\
        \ excluded if they spanned a sequencing gap region. The predicted bacterial\
        \ protein sequences were searched against the GenBank database [15] and the\
        \ Clusters of Orthologous Groups databases using BLASTP. The tRNAScanSE tool\
        \ [16] was used to find tRNA genes, whereas ribosomal RNAs were found using\
        \ RNAmmer [17] and BLASTn against the GenBank database. Lipoprotein signal\
        \ peptides and the number of transmembrane helices were predicted using SignalP\
        \ [18] and TMHMM [19] respectively. ORFans were identified if their BLASTP\
        \ E-value was lower than 1e-03 for alignment length greater than 80 amino\
        \ acids. If alignment lengths were smaller than 80 amino acids, we used an\
        \ E-value of 1e-05. Such parameter thresholds have already been used in previous\
        \ works to define ORFans. Artemis [20] was used for data management and DNA\
        \ Plotter [21] for visualization of genomic features. The Mauve alignment\
        \ tool (version 2.3.1) was used for multiple genomic sequence alignment [22].\
        \ To estimate the mean level of nucleotide sequence similarity at the genome\
        \ level, we used the AGIOS home-made software [9]. Briefly, this software\
        \ combines the Proteinortho software [23] for detecting orthologous proteins\
        \ in pairwise genomic comparisons, then retrieves the corresponding genes\
        \ and determines the mean percentage of nucleotide sequence identity among\
        \ orthologous ORFs using the Needleman-Wunsch global alignment algorithm.\
        \ The script created to calculate AGIOS values was named MAGi and is written\
        \ in perl and bioperl modules. GGDC analysis was also performed using the\
        \ GGDC web server as previously reported [24, 25].\\n\\n## Genome properties\\\
        n\\nThe genome of Haemophilusmassiliensis strain FF7T is 2,442,548 bp-long\
        \ with a 46.0 % G + C content. Of the 2,386 predicted genes, 2,319 were protein-\
        \ coding genes and 67 were RNA genes, including six complete rRNA operons.\
        \ A total of 1,885 genes (79.5 %) were assigned a putative function. A total\
        \ of 36 genes were identified as ORFans (1.5 %). The remaining genes were\
        \ annotated as hypothetical proteins. The properties and statistics of the\
        \ genome are summarized in Table 3 and Fig. 3. The distribution of genes into\
        \ COGs functional categories is presented in Table 4 and Fig. 4. The distribution\
        \ of genes into COGs categories was similar for most of the compared species\
        \ (Fig. 4). However, H. influenzae and H. aegyptius were over-represented\
        \ for category N (cell motility), and H. ducreyi was under-represented for\

        \ relies on a combination of phenotypic and genotypic characteristics [3,\
        \ 4]; including 16S rRNA sequence similarity, G + C content and DNA-DNA hybridization.\
        \ However, these tools suffer from various drawbacks, mainly due to their\
        \ threshold values that are not applicable to all species or genera [5, 6].\
        \ With the development of cost-effective, high-throughput sequencing techniques,\
        \ dozens of thousands of bacterial genome sequences have been made available\
        \ in public databases [7]. Recently, we developed a strategy named taxono-genomics\
        \ in which genomic and phenotypic characteristics, notably the MALDI-TOF-MS\
        \ spectrum, are systematically compared to the phylogenetically-closest species\
        \ with a name with standing in nomenclature [8, 9].The strain FF7T was isolated\

              \ ataxia type 7 (SCA7) comprises a phenotypic spectrum ranging from\
              \ adolescent- or adult-onset progressive cerebellar ataxia and cone-rod\
              \ retinal dystrophy to infantile or early-childhood onset with multiorgan\
              \ failure, an accelerated course, and early death. Anticipation in this\
              \ nucleotide repeat disorder may be so dramatic that within a family\
              \ a child with infantile or early-childhood onset may be diagnosed with\
              \ what is thought to be an unrelated neurodegenerative disorder years\
              \ before a parent or grandparent with a CAG repeat expansion becomes\
              \ symptomatic. In adolescent-onset SCA7, the initial manifestation is\
              \ typically impaired vision, followed by cerebellar ataxia. In those\
              \ with adult onset, progressive cerebellar ataxia usually precedes the\
              \ onset of visual manifestations. While the rate of progression varies\
              \ in these two age groups, the eventual result for almost all affected\
              \ individuals is loss of vision, severe dysarthria and dysphagia, and\
              \ a bedridden state with loss of motor control.<h4>Diagnosis/testing</h4>The\
              \ diagnosis of SCA7 is established in a proband by the identification\
              \ of a heterozygous abnormal CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in ATXN7\
              \ by molecular genetic testing.<h4>Management</h4>Treatment of manifestations:\
              \ Multidisciplinary care involves supportive treatment of: neurologic\
              \ manifestations \u2013 physical and occupational therapy to help maintain\
              \ mobility and function, and pharmacologic treatment to reduce symptoms;\
              \ dysarthria \u2013 speech and language therapy and alternative communication\
              \ methods; dysphagia \u2013 feeding therapy to improve nutrition and\
              \ reduce the risk of aspiration; and reduced vision \u2013 use of low\
              \ vision aids and consultation with agencies for the visually impaired.\
              \ Surveillance: Routine follow up with multidisciplinary care providers.\
              \ Agents/circumstances to avoid: Avoid: alcohol intake (especially if\
              \ excessive) as it can further impair cerebellar function; foods identified\

              \ Therapies under investigation: Several ongoing clinical trials for\
              \ medications used as treatment for ataxia.<h4>Genetic counseling</h4>SCA7\

              \ individual have a 50% chance of inheriting an abnormal CAG repeat\
              \ expansion in ATXN7. Once an ATXN7 CAG repeat expansion has been identified\
              \ in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at\

              \ Hyphomonadaceae within the Alphaproteobacteria is largely comprised\
              \ of bacteria isolated from marine environments with striking morphologies\
              \ and an unusual mode of cell growth. Here, we report the complete genome\
              \ sequence Hirschia baltica, which is only the second a member of the\
              \ Hyphomonadaceae with a published genome sequence. H. baltica is of\
              \ special interest because it has a dimorphic life cycle and is a stalked,\
              \ budding bacterium. The 3,455,622 bp long chromosome and 84,492 bp\
              \ plasmid with a total of 3,222 protein-coding and 44 RNA genes were\
              \ sequenced as part of the DOE Joint Genome Institute Program CSP 2008.\\\
              n\\n## Introduction\\n\\nStrain IFAM 1418T (= ATCC 49814 = DSM 5838\
              \ = KCTC 12471) is the type strain of the species Hirschia baltica,\
              \ which is the type species of the genus Hirschia. The genus name Hirschia\
              \ Baker 1896 has been applied to a member of the Asteraceae, although\
              \ the type and only species, Hirschia anthemidifolia has also been placed\
              \ in the genus Iphiona [1]. The genus Hirschia was named in honor of\
              \ Peter Hirsch, a German microbiologist and expert on budding and hyphal\
              \ bacteria. The species epithet refers to the Neo-Latin baltica, pertaining\
              \ to the Baltic Sea [2]. IFAM 1418T was isolated in 1982 along with\
              \ two additional stalk-forming isolates belonging to the same species,\
              \ IFAM 1408 and IFAM 1415, from a sample of surface water taken from\
              \ a boat landing in the Kiel Fjord [2].\\n\\nH. baltica reproduces by\
              \ budding from the tip of a stalk and has a dimorphic life-cycle similar\
              \ to that described in bacteria belonging to the closely related genus\
              \ Hyphomonas [2]. Newborn swarmer cells are motile by means of a polar\
              \ flagellum. Swarmer cells differentiate into stalked sessile cells\
              \ by ejecting the flagellum and synthesizing a stalk at the same pole.\
              \ The sessile cells reproduce by budding such that motile daughter cells\
              \ are formed at and released from the tip of the stalk. Here we present\
              \ a summary classification and a set of features for H. baltica IFAM\
              \ 1418T, together with the description of the complete genomic sequencing\
              \ and annotation.\\n\\n## Classification and features\\n\\nA representative\
              \ genomic 16S rRNA sequence of H. baltica was compared using NCBI BLAST\
              \ [3] under default settings (e.g., considering only the high-scoring\
              \ segment pairs (HSPs) from the best 250 hits) with the most recent\
              \ release of the Greengenes database [4] and the relative frequencies\
              \ of taxa and keywords (reduced to their stem [5]) were determined,\
              \ weighted by BLAST scores. The most frequently occurring genera were\
              \ Hyphomonas (37.8%), Maricaulis (29.5%), Hirschia (14.3%), Caulobacter\
              \ (7.4%) and Woodsholea (3.6%) (74 hits in total). Regarding the four\
              \ hits to sequences from members of the Hirschia species, the average\
              \ identity within HSPs was 99.3%, whereas the average coverage by HSPs\
              \ was 98.8%. Among all other species, the one yielding the highest score\
              \ was Hyphomonas johnsonii (NR_024938), which corresponded to an identity\
              \ of 93.1% and an HSP coverage of 59.6%. (Note that the Greengenes database\
              \ uses the INSDC (= EMBL/NCBI/DDBJ) annotation, which is not an authoritative\
              \ source for nomenclature or classification.) The highest-scoring environmental\
              \ sequence was FR684125 ('effect ocean acidification upon microbial\
              \ prokaryotes marine biome fjord coastal water clone 16 07 04A09'),\
              \ which showed an identity of 89.4% and an HSP coverage of 99.0%. The\
              \ most frequently occurring keywords within the labels of environmental\
              \ samples which yielded hits were 'marin' (2.2%), 'microbi' (2.1%),\
              \ 'water' (2.0%), 'biofilm' (1.9%) and 'sea' (1.6%) (176 hits in total).\
              \ Environmental samples which yielded hits of a higher score than the\
              \ highest scoring species were not found. These keywords reflect very\
              \ well some the ecological and physiological properties reported for\
              \ strain IFAM 1418T in the original description [2].\\n\\nFigure 1 shows\
              \ the phylogenetic neighborhood of H. baltica in a 16S rRNA based tree.\
              \ The sequences of the two identical 16S rRNA gene copies in the genome\
              \ differ by one nucleotide from the previously published 16S rRNA sequence\
              \ (AJ421782), which contains one ambiguous base call.\\n\\n![Figure:\
              \ Phylogenetic tree highlighting the position of H. baltica relative\
              \ to the type strains of the other species within the family Hyphomonadaceae.\
              \ The tree was inferred from 1,332 aligned characters [6,7] of the 16S\
              \ rRNA gene sequence under the maximum likelihood (ML) criterion [8]\
              \ and rooted with the neighboring family Parvularculaceae. The branches\
              \ are scaled in terms of the expected number of substitutions per site.\
              \ Numbers adjacent to the branches are support values from 450 ML bootstrap\
              \ replicates [9] (left) and from 1,000 maximum parsimony (MP) bootstrap\
              \ replicates [10] (right) if larger than 60%. Lineages with type strain\
              \ genome sequencing projects registered in GOLD [11] are labeled with\
              \ one asterisk, those also listed as 'Complete and Published' (as well\
              \ as the target genome) with two asterisks [12,13].](figure_description)\\\
              n\\nCells of H. baltica strain IFAM 1418T are rod-shaped, elliptical\
              \ or ovoid with 0.5 \u2013 1.0 by 0.5 \u2013 6.0 \xB5m in size (without\
              \ hyphae which have a diameter of about 0.2 \xB5m) (Figure 2) [2]. IFAM\
              \ 1418T cells stain Gram-negative, are motile and strictly aerobic [2].\
              \ 1 to 2 hyphae are located polarly and flagellation is monotrichous\
              \ polar [2]. Cells grow best in artificial sea water with a broad range\
              \ of NaCl concentrations (Table 1). The strain grows on a broad spectrum\
              \ of organic compounds as carbon source such as amino acids, organic\
              \ acids and sugars (Table 1), but not on C1 compounds [2]. In contrast\
              \ to its phylogenetic neighbors H. baltica strains do not store PHB\
              \ [2]. Colonies of strain IFAM 1418T show a yellow pigmentation whereas\
              \ strain IFAM 1408 colonies are white [2].\\n\\n![Figure: Scanning Electron\

              \ of H. baltica contain meso-diamonopimelic acid [2]. The main quinone\
              \ component is Q10 [2,24]. In the original publications by Schlesner\
              \ et al. [2] and Sittig and Hirsch [24] the fatty acids were separated\
              \ into non-hydroxy fatty acids and hydroxy-fatty acids. Main cellular\
              \ non-hydroxy fatty acids are C18:1 \u039411 (48.8%), C16:0 (22.1%),\
              \ C18:2 \u03945,11 (9.5%), C16:1 \u03945 (4.6%), and C14:1 \u03947 (3.2%).\
              \ Among the hydroxylated fatty acids IFAM 1418T 3-OH fatty acids with\
              \ C14:1 3-OH (79%) and C12:0 3-OH (15.8%) predominate, which are useful\
              \ for the discrimination for H. baltica from strains of Hyphomicrobium\
              \ and Hyphomonas (Figure 1). Kang and Lee [25] were unable to confirm\
              \ the presence of these hydoxylated fatty acids in H. baltica. There\
              \ are two reports [2,24] on the lipid composition of H. baltica and\
              \ one on the lipids of H. maritima [25]. While all confirm the presence\
              \ of a single phospholipid, phosphatidylglycerol in members of this\
              \ genus, it is unclear whether these studies were limited to the detection\
              \ of only phospholipids. There is evidence that H. baltica contains\
              \ five major lipids, of which one is phosphatidlyglycerol (BJ Tindall,\
              \ unpublished). The remaining four lipids are not phosphate positive,\
              \ but their Rf values and staining behavior indicate similarities to\
              \ a number of the unusual lipids reported from Hyphomonas jannaschiana\
              \ [26,27].\\n\\n## Chemotaxonomy\\n\\nCell walls of H. baltica contain\

              \ strain in two culture collections, ATCC and DSMZ (in 1989).\\n\\n###\
              \ Growth conditions and DNA isolation\\n\\nThe culture of strain IFAM\
              \ 1418T used to prepare genomic DNA (gDNA) for sequencing was obtained\
              \ directly from the ATCC. ATCC 49814 was grown in Hirschia medium (ATCC\
              \ medium 1883) at 30\xB0C with shaking.\\n\\n### Genome sequencing and\
              \ assembly\\n\\nThe genome was sequenced using a combination of Illumina\
              \ and 454 sequencing platforms. All general aspects of library construction\
              \ and sequencing can be found at the JGI website [28]. Pyrosequencing\
              \ reads were assembled using the Newbler assembler (Roche). The initial\
              \ Newbler assembly consisting of nine contigs in two scaffolds was converted\
              \ into a phrap [29] assembly by making fake reads from the consensus,\
              \ to collect the read pairs in the 454 paired end library. Illumina\
              \ GAii sequencing data (50 Mb) were assembled with Velvet [30] and the\
              \ consensus sequences were shredded into 1.5 kb overlapped fake reads\
              \ and assembled together with the 454 data. The 454 draft assembly was\
              \ based on 128.0 Mb 454 draft data and all of the 454 paired end data.\
              \ Newbler parameters were -consed -a 50 - l350 -g -m -ml 20. The Phred/Phrap/Consed\
              \ software package [29] was used for sequence assembly and quality assessment\
              \ in the subsequent finishing process. After the shotgun stage, reads\
              \ were assembled with parallel phrap (High Performance Software, LLC).\
              \ Possible mis-assemblies were corrected with gapResolution [28], Dupfinisher\
              \ [31], or sequencing cloned bridging PCR fragments with subcloning.\
              \ Gaps between contigs were closed by editing in Consed, by PCR and\
              \ by Bubble PCR primer walks (J.-F. Chang, unpublished). A total of\
              \ 55 additional reactions were necessary to close gaps and to raise\
              \ the quality of the finished sequence. Illumina reads were also used\
              \ to correct potential base errors and increase consensus quality using\
              \ a software Polisher developed at JGI [28,32]. The error rate of the\
              \ completed genome sequence is less than 1 in 100,000. Together, the\
              \ combination of the Illumina and 454 sequencing platforms provided\
              \ 150.6 \xD7 coverage of the genome. The final assembly contained 333,683\
              \ pyrosequence and 12,860,398 Illumina reads.\\n\\n### Genome annotation\\\

              \ baltica genome is enriched in TonB-dependent receptors\\n\\nTonB-dependent\
              \ receptors are outer membrane proteins that function in the energy-dependent\
              \ uptake of macromolecules, including siderophores and vitamins, that\
              \ are too large to be taken up by passive diffusion. The genome sequences\
              \ of C. crescentus and H. neptunium contain large numbers (63 and 43,\
              \ respectively) of TonB dependent receptors [40,41]. One possibility\
              \ is that the presence of many TonB-dependent receptors is a common\
              \ feature among bacteria belonging to the order Caulobacterales. Indeed,\
              \ the annotation of the H. baltica genome sequence suggests that there\
              \ are 46 TonB-dependent receptors. The presence of many TonB-dependent\
              \ receptors may be part of the adaptations that have allowed the Caulobacterales\
              \ to not only inhabit, but also thrive in low-nutrient environments.\\\
              n\\n### H. baltica genome contains known regulators of the cell cycle\\\
              n\\nA recent bioinformatic analysis of genes controlling the dimorphic\
              \ cell cycle within the Alphaproteobacteria suggests the circuitry for\
              \ cell-cycle control is largely conserved [42]. The conservation of\
              \ 14 key proteins that function in the regulation of the cell cycle\
              \ in C. crescentus was addressed among the Alphaproteobacteria with\
              \ sequenced genomes, including three bacteria belonging to the Caulobacterales.\
              \ All of the regulatory proteins were conserved among the genomes of\
              \ the Caulobacterales with one notable exception: DivJ, a histidine\
              \ kinase, is absent in the H. neptunium genome.\\n\\nExpanding the analysis\
              \ to include 8 additional bacteria belonging to the Caulobacterales,\
              \ including H. baltica, we find that all 14 regulatory proteins are\
              \ conserved with the exception of DivJ, which is absent only from the\
              \ H. neptunium and H. baltica genomes. The fact that most developmental\
              \ regulators are conserved in the budding bacteria H. neptunium and\
              \ H. baltica as well as the non-budding bacteria belonging to the Caulobacterales\
              \ suggests that regulation of the cell cycle is evolved prior to the\
              \ separation of the budding and non-budding bacteria in the Caulobacterales.\
              \ The finding that DivJ is absent from H. neptunium and H. baltica but\
              \ present in the closely related non-budding Maricaulis maris and Oceanicaulis\
              \ alexandrii (Figure 1) is an intriguing observation, although the significance\
              \ of this finding remains unknown.\\n\\n### H. baltica genome contains\
              \ genes for holdfast synthesis and attachment\\n\\nBacteria belonging\
              \ to the order Caulobacterales are known for the ability to produce\
              \ a polar polysaccharide, termed holdfast, which mediates strong adhesion\
              \ to surfaces (For review see [43]). Notably, extracellular polysaccharides\
              \ from some of the stalked bacteria sequester metals [44,45], a feature\
              \ that could be used to remediate environments affected by metal toxicity.\
              \ The genes required for the synthesis [46,47] and anchoring [48] of\
              \ the holdfast have been identified and characterized in C. crescentus.\
              \ The holdfast synthesis and anchor genes are largely absent from the\
              \ genome of H. neptunium, which does not produce a polar holdfast (Figure\
              \ 4 and [41]). The genome sequence of H. baltica revealed that the genes\
              \ predicted to be involved in polar holdfast synthesis are present (Figure\
              \ 4). Furthermore, a holdfast on H. baltica cells was readily detected\
              \ using a fluorescent wheat germ agglutinin lectin using the procedure\
              \ detailed in [44] (Figure 4). The holdfast of H. baltica is found at\
              \ the cell pole opposite the stalk of the mother cell and is responsible\
              \ for the formation of star-shaped cell aggregates known as rosettes\
              \ in cell culture (Figure 4). This finding, coupled with the observation\
              \ that other species of Hyphomonas produce detectable holdfasts [49],\
              \ suggests the ability to synthesize holdfast is a conserved feature\
              \ among the Hyphomonadaceae family and the loss of the holdfast synthesis\
              \ and anchoring genes in H. neptunium was a recent evolutionary event.\\\

              \ the biology of stalked budding bacteria with a dimorphic life cycle.\
              \ Further comparative genomic analyses (especially as more bacteria\
              \ belonging to the Caulobacterales are sequenced) are likely to provide\
              \ insights regarding the evolution, mechanism, and advantages underlying\
              \ processes such as budding, and stalk synthesis. Understanding stalk\
              \ biosynthesis is of particular interest as the ability of these structures\
              \ to transport nutrients [50,51] could likely be exploited to facilitate\
              \ the uptake of toxic compounds from contaminated water sources.\\n\\\

              \ is the type strain of the species Hirschia baltica, which is the type\
              \ species of the genus Hirschia. The genus name Hirschia Baker 1896\
              \ has been applied to a member of the Asteraceae, although the type\
              \ and only species, Hirschia anthemidifolia has also been placed in\
              \ the genus Iphiona [1]. The genus Hirschia was named in honor of Peter\
              \ Hirsch, a German microbiologist and expert on budding and hyphal bacteria.\
              \ The species epithet refers to the Neo-Latin baltica, pertaining to\
              \ the Baltic Sea [2]. IFAM 1418T was isolated in 1982 along with two\
              \ additional stalk-forming isolates belonging to the same species, IFAM\
              \ 1408 and IFAM 1415, from a sample of surface water taken from a boat\
              \ landing in the Kiel Fjord [2].H. baltica reproduces by budding from\
              \ the tip of a stalk and has a dimorphic life-cycle similar to that\
              \ described in bacteria belonging to the closely related genus Hyphomonas\
              \ [2]. Newborn swarmer cells are motile by means of a polar flagellum.\
              \ Swarmer cells differentiate into stalked sessile cells by ejecting\
              \ the flagellum and synthesizing a stalk at the same pole. The sessile\
              \ cells reproduce by budding such that motile daughter cells are formed\
              \ at and released from the tip of the stalk. Here we present a summary\
              \ classification and a set of features for H. baltica IFAM 1418T, together\

        \ Abstract\\n\\nThe family Hyphomonadaceae within the Alphaproteobacteria\
        \ is largely comprised of bacteria isolated from marine environments with\
        \ striking morphologies and an unusual mode of cell growth. Here, we report\
        \ the complete genome sequence Hirschia baltica, which is only the second\
        \ a member of the Hyphomonadaceae with a published genome sequence. H. baltica\
        \ is of special interest because it has a dimorphic life cycle and is a stalked,\
        \ budding bacterium. The 3,455,622 bp long chromosome and 84,492 bp plasmid\
        \ with a total of 3,222 protein-coding and 44 RNA genes were sequenced as\
        \ part of the DOE Joint Genome Institute Program CSP 2008.\\n\\n## Introduction\\\
        n\\nStrain IFAM 1418T (= ATCC 49814 = DSM 5838 = KCTC 12471) is the type strain\
        \ of the species Hirschia baltica, which is the type species of the genus\
        \ Hirschia. The genus name Hirschia Baker 1896 has been applied to a member\
        \ of the Asteraceae, although the type and only species, Hirschia anthemidifolia\
        \ has also been placed in the genus Iphiona [1]. The genus Hirschia was named\
        \ in honor of Peter Hirsch, a German microbiologist and expert on budding\
        \ and hyphal bacteria. The species epithet refers to the Neo-Latin baltica,\
        \ pertaining to the Baltic Sea [2]. IFAM 1418T was isolated in 1982 along\
        \ with two additional stalk-forming isolates belonging to the same species,\
        \ IFAM 1408 and IFAM 1415, from a sample of surface water taken from a boat\
        \ landing in the Kiel Fjord [2].\\n\\nH. baltica reproduces by budding from\
        \ the tip of a stalk and has a dimorphic life-cycle similar to that described\
        \ in bacteria belonging to the closely related genus Hyphomonas [2]. Newborn\
        \ swarmer cells are motile by means of a polar flagellum. Swarmer cells differentiate\
        \ into stalked sessile cells by ejecting the flagellum and synthesizing a\
        \ stalk at the same pole. The sessile cells reproduce by budding such that\
        \ motile daughter cells are formed at and released from the tip of the stalk.\
        \ Here we present a summary classification and a set of features for H. baltica\
        \ IFAM 1418T, together with the description of the complete genomic sequencing\
        \ and annotation.\\n\\n## Classification and features\\n\\nA representative\
        \ genomic 16S rRNA sequence of H. baltica was compared using NCBI BLAST [3]\
        \ under default settings (e.g., considering only the high-scoring segment\
        \ pairs (HSPs) from the best 250 hits) with the most recent release of the\
        \ Greengenes database [4] and the relative frequencies of taxa and keywords\
        \ (reduced to their stem [5]) were determined, weighted by BLAST scores. The\
        \ most frequently occurring genera were Hyphomonas (37.8%), Maricaulis (29.5%),\
        \ Hirschia (14.3%), Caulobacter (7.4%) and Woodsholea (3.6%) (74 hits in total).\
        \ Regarding the four hits to sequences from members of the Hirschia species,\
        \ the average identity within HSPs was 99.3%, whereas the average coverage\
        \ by HSPs was 98.8%. Among all other species, the one yielding the highest\
        \ score was Hyphomonas johnsonii (NR_024938), which corresponded to an identity\
        \ of 93.1% and an HSP coverage of 59.6%. (Note that the Greengenes database\
        \ uses the INSDC (= EMBL/NCBI/DDBJ) annotation, which is not an authoritative\
        \ source for nomenclature or classification.) The highest-scoring environmental\
        \ sequence was FR684125 ('effect ocean acidification upon microbial prokaryotes\
        \ marine biome fjord coastal water clone 16 07 04A09'), which showed an identity\
        \ of 89.4% and an HSP coverage of 99.0%. The most frequently occurring keywords\
        \ within the labels of environmental samples which yielded hits were 'marin'\
        \ (2.2%), 'microbi' (2.1%), 'water' (2.0%), 'biofilm' (1.9%) and 'sea' (1.6%)\
        \ (176 hits in total). Environmental samples which yielded hits of a higher\
        \ score than the highest scoring species were not found. These keywords reflect\
        \ very well some the ecological and physiological properties reported for\
        \ strain IFAM 1418T in the original description [2].\\n\\nFigure 1 shows the\
        \ phylogenetic neighborhood of H. baltica in a 16S rRNA based tree. The sequences\
        \ of the two identical 16S rRNA gene copies in the genome differ by one nucleotide\
        \ from the previously published 16S rRNA sequence (AJ421782), which contains\
        \ one ambiguous base call.\\n\\n![Figure: Phylogenetic tree highlighting the\
        \ position of H. baltica relative to the type strains of the other species\
        \ within the family Hyphomonadaceae. The tree was inferred from 1,332 aligned\
        \ characters [6,7] of the 16S rRNA gene sequence under the maximum likelihood\
        \ (ML) criterion [8] and rooted with the neighboring family Parvularculaceae.\
        \ The branches are scaled in terms of the expected number of substitutions\
        \ per site. Numbers adjacent to the branches are support values from 450 ML\
        \ bootstrap replicates [9] (left) and from 1,000 maximum parsimony (MP) bootstrap\
        \ replicates [10] (right) if larger than 60%. Lineages with type strain genome\
        \ sequencing projects registered in GOLD [11] are labeled with one asterisk,\
        \ those also listed as 'Complete and Published' (as well as the target genome)\
        \ with two asterisks [12,13].](figure_description)\\n\\nCells of H. baltica\
        \ strain IFAM 1418T are rod-shaped, elliptical or ovoid with 0.5 \u2013 1.0\
        \ by 0.5 \u2013 6.0 \xB5m in size (without hyphae which have a diameter of\
        \ about 0.2 \xB5m) (Figure 2) [2]. IFAM 1418T cells stain Gram-negative, are\
        \ motile and strictly aerobic [2]. 1 to 2 hyphae are located polarly and flagellation\
        \ is monotrichous polar [2]. Cells grow best in artificial sea water with\
        \ a broad range of NaCl concentrations (Table 1). The strain grows on a broad\
        \ spectrum of organic compounds as carbon source such as amino acids, organic\
        \ acids and sugars (Table 1), but not on C1 compounds [2]. In contrast to\
        \ its phylogenetic neighbors H. baltica strains do not store PHB [2]. Colonies\
        \ of strain IFAM 1418T show a yellow pigmentation whereas strain IFAM 1408\
        \ colonies are white [2].\\n\\n![Figure: Scanning Electron micrograph of H.\

        \ contain meso-diamonopimelic acid [2]. The main quinone component is Q10\
        \ [2,24]. In the original publications by Schlesner et al. [2] and Sittig\
        \ and Hirsch [24] the fatty acids were separated into non-hydroxy fatty acids\
        \ and hydroxy-fatty acids. Main cellular non-hydroxy fatty acids are C18:1\
        \ \u039411 (48.8%), C16:0 (22.1%), C18:2 \u03945,11 (9.5%), C16:1 \u03945\
        \ (4.6%), and C14:1 \u03947 (3.2%). Among the hydroxylated fatty acids IFAM\
        \ 1418T 3-OH fatty acids with C14:1 3-OH (79%) and C12:0 3-OH (15.8%) predominate,\
        \ which are useful for the discrimination for H. baltica from strains of Hyphomicrobium\
        \ and Hyphomonas (Figure 1). Kang and Lee [25] were unable to confirm the\
        \ presence of these hydoxylated fatty acids in H. baltica. There are two reports\
        \ [2,24] on the lipid composition of H. baltica and one on the lipids of H.\
        \ maritima [25]. While all confirm the presence of a single phospholipid,\
        \ phosphatidylglycerol in members of this genus, it is unclear whether these\
        \ studies were limited to the detection of only phospholipids. There is evidence\
        \ that H. baltica contains five major lipids, of which one is phosphatidlyglycerol\
        \ (BJ Tindall, unpublished). The remaining four lipids are not phosphate positive,\
        \ but their Rf values and staining behavior indicate similarities to a number\
        \ of the unusual lipids reported from Hyphomonas jannaschiana [26,27].\\n\\\

        \ of strain IFAM 1418T starts with H. Schlesner who independently deposited\
        \ the strain in two culture collections, ATCC and DSMZ (in 1989).\\n\\n###\
        \ Growth conditions and DNA isolation\\n\\nThe culture of strain IFAM 1418T\
        \ used to prepare genomic DNA (gDNA) for sequencing was obtained directly\
        \ from the ATCC. ATCC 49814 was grown in Hirschia medium (ATCC medium 1883)\
        \ at 30\xB0C with shaking.\\n\\n### Genome sequencing and assembly\\n\\nThe\
        \ genome was sequenced using a combination of Illumina and 454 sequencing\
        \ platforms. All general aspects of library construction and sequencing can\
        \ be found at the JGI website [28]. Pyrosequencing reads were assembled using\
        \ the Newbler assembler (Roche). The initial Newbler assembly consisting of\
        \ nine contigs in two scaffolds was converted into a phrap [29] assembly by\
        \ making fake reads from the consensus, to collect the read pairs in the 454\
        \ paired end library. Illumina GAii sequencing data (50 Mb) were assembled\
        \ with Velvet [30] and the consensus sequences were shredded into 1.5 kb overlapped\
        \ fake reads and assembled together with the 454 data. The 454 draft assembly\
        \ was based on 128.0 Mb 454 draft data and all of the 454 paired end data.\
        \ Newbler parameters were -consed -a 50 - l350 -g -m -ml 20. The Phred/Phrap/Consed\
        \ software package [29] was used for sequence assembly and quality assessment\

        \ used to prepare genomic DNA (gDNA) for sequencing was obtained directly\
        \ from the ATCC. ATCC 49814 was grown in Hirschia medium (ATCC medium 1883)\
        \ at 30\xB0C with shaking.\\n\\n## Genome sequencing and assembly\\n\\nThe\

        \ be found at the JGI website [28]. Pyrosequencing reads were assembled using\
        \ the Newbler assembler (Roche). The initial Newbler assembly consisting of\
        \ nine contigs in two scaffolds was converted into a phrap [29] assembly by\
        \ making fake reads from the consensus, to collect the read pairs in the 454\
        \ paired end library. Illumina GAii sequencing data (50 Mb) were assembled\
        \ with Velvet [30] and the consensus sequences were shredded into 1.5 kb overlapped\
        \ fake reads and assembled together with the 454 data. The 454 draft assembly\
        \ was based on 128.0 Mb 454 draft data and all of the 454 paired end data.\
        \ Newbler parameters were -consed -a 50 - l350 -g -m -ml 20. The Phred/Phrap/Consed\
        \ software package [29] was used for sequence assembly and quality assessment\
        \ in the subsequent finishing process. After the shotgun stage, reads were\
        \ assembled with parallel phrap (High Performance Software, LLC). Possible\

        \ baltica genome sequence\\n\\n### H. baltica genome is enriched in TonB-dependent\
        \ receptors\\n\\nTonB-dependent receptors are outer membrane proteins that\
        \ function in the energy-dependent uptake of macromolecules, including siderophores\
        \ and vitamins, that are too large to be taken up by passive diffusion. The\
        \ genome sequences of C. crescentus and H. neptunium contain large numbers\
        \ (63 and 43, respectively) of TonB dependent receptors [40,41]. One possibility\
        \ is that the presence of many TonB-dependent receptors is a common feature\
        \ among bacteria belonging to the order Caulobacterales. Indeed, the annotation\
        \ of the H. baltica genome sequence suggests that there are 46 TonB-dependent\
        \ receptors. The presence of many TonB-dependent receptors may be part of\
        \ the adaptations that have allowed the Caulobacterales to not only inhabit,\
        \ but also thrive in low-nutrient environments.\\n\\n### H. baltica genome\
        \ contains known regulators of the cell cycle\\n\\nA recent bioinformatic\
        \ analysis of genes controlling the dimorphic cell cycle within the Alphaproteobacteria\
        \ suggests the circuitry for cell-cycle control is largely conserved [42].\
        \ The conservation of 14 key proteins that function in the regulation of the\
        \ cell cycle in C. crescentus was addressed among the Alphaproteobacteria\
        \ with sequenced genomes, including three bacteria belonging to the Caulobacterales.\
        \ All of the regulatory proteins were conserved among the genomes of the Caulobacterales\
        \ with one notable exception: DivJ, a histidine kinase, is absent in the H.\
        \ neptunium genome.\\n\\nExpanding the analysis to include 8 additional bacteria\
        \ belonging to the Caulobacterales, including H. baltica, we find that all\
        \ 14 regulatory proteins are conserved with the exception of DivJ, which is\
        \ absent only from the H. neptunium and H. baltica genomes. The fact that\
        \ most developmental regulators are conserved in the budding bacteria H. neptunium\
        \ and H. baltica as well as the non-budding bacteria belonging to the Caulobacterales\
        \ suggests that regulation of the cell cycle is evolved prior to the separation\
        \ of the budding and non-budding bacteria in the Caulobacterales. The finding\
        \ that DivJ is absent from H. neptunium and H. baltica but present in the\
        \ closely related non-budding Maricaulis maris and Oceanicaulis alexandrii\
        \ (Figure 1) is an intriguing observation, although the significance of this\
        \ finding remains unknown.\\n\\n### H. baltica genome contains genes for holdfast\
        \ synthesis and attachment\\n\\nBacteria belonging to the order Caulobacterales\
        \ are known for the ability to produce a polar polysaccharide, termed holdfast,\
        \ which mediates strong adhesion to surfaces (For review see [43]). Notably,\
        \ extracellular polysaccharides from some of the stalked bacteria sequester\
        \ metals [44,45], a feature that could be used to remediate environments affected\
        \ by metal toxicity. The genes required for the synthesis [46,47] and anchoring\
        \ [48] of the holdfast have been identified and characterized in C. crescentus.\
        \ The holdfast synthesis and anchor genes are largely absent from the genome\
        \ of H. neptunium, which does not produce a polar holdfast (Figure 4 and [41]).\
        \ The genome sequence of H. baltica revealed that the genes predicted to be\
        \ involved in polar holdfast synthesis are present (Figure 4). Furthermore,\
        \ a holdfast on H. baltica cells was readily detected using a fluorescent\
        \ wheat germ agglutinin lectin using the procedure detailed in [44] (Figure\
        \ 4). The holdfast of H. baltica is found at the cell pole opposite the stalk\
        \ of the mother cell and is responsible for the formation of star-shaped cell\
        \ aggregates known as rosettes in cell culture (Figure 4). This finding, coupled\
        \ with the observation that other species of Hyphomonas produce detectable\
        \ holdfasts [49], suggests the ability to synthesize holdfast is a conserved\
        \ feature among the Hyphomonadaceae family and the loss of the holdfast synthesis\
        \ and anchoring genes in H. neptunium was a recent evolutionary event.\\n\\\

        \ is expected to provide a valuable resource for understanding the biology\
        \ of stalked budding bacteria with a dimorphic life cycle. Further comparative\
        \ genomic analyses (especially as more bacteria belonging to the Caulobacterales\
        \ are sequenced) are likely to provide insights regarding the evolution, mechanism,\
        \ and advantages underlying processes such as budding, and stalk synthesis.\
        \ Understanding stalk biosynthesis is of particular interest as the ability\
        \ of these structures to transport nutrients [50,51] could likely be exploited\
        \ to facilitate the uptake of toxic compounds from contaminated water sources.\\\

        :\"The family Hyphomonadaceae within the Alphaproteobacteria is largely comprised\
        \ of bacteria isolated from marine environments with striking morphologies\
        \ and an unusual mode of cell growth. Here, we report the complete genome\
        \ sequence Hirschia baltica, which is only the second a member of the Hyphomonadaceae\
        \ with a published genome sequence. H. baltica is of special interest because\
        \ it has a dimorphic life cycle and is a stalked, budding bacterium. The 3,455,622\
        \ bp long chromosome and 84,492 bp plasmid with a total of 3,222 protein-coding\
        \ and 44 RNA genes were sequenced as part of the DOE Joint Genome Institute\
        \ Program CSP 2008.\",\"introduction\":\"IntroductionStrain IFAM 1418T (=\
        \ ATCC 49814 = DSM 5838 = KCTC 12471) is the type strain of the species Hirschia\
        \ baltica, which is the type species of the genus Hirschia. The genus name\
        \ Hirschia Baker 1896 has been applied to a member of the Asteraceae, although\
        \ the type and only species, Hirschia anthemidifolia has also been placed\
        \ in the genus Iphiona [1]. The genus Hirschia was named in honor of Peter\
        \ Hirsch, a German microbiologist and expert on budding and hyphal bacteria.\
        \ The species epithet refers to the Neo-Latin baltica, pertaining to the Baltic\
        \ Sea [2]. IFAM 1418T was isolated in 1982 along with two additional stalk-forming\
        \ isolates belonging to the same species, IFAM 1408 and IFAM 1415, from a\
        \ sample of surface water taken from a boat landing in the Kiel Fjord [2].H.\
        \ baltica reproduces by budding from the tip of a stalk and has a dimorphic\
        \ life-cycle similar to that described in bacteria belonging to the closely\
        \ related genus Hyphomonas [2]. Newborn swarmer cells are motile by means\
        \ of a polar flagellum. Swarmer cells differentiate into stalked sessile cells\
        \ by ejecting the flagellum and synthesizing a stalk at the same pole. The\
        \ sessile cells reproduce by budding such that motile daughter cells are formed\
        \ at and released from the tip of the stalk. Here we present a summary classification\
        \ and a set of features for H. baltica IFAM 1418T, together with the description\
        \ of the complete genomic sequencing and annotation.\",\"references\":\"References1AnderbergA\

              frontal lobe epilepsy (NFLE) is a focal epilepsy with seizures arising
              mainly during sleep and characterized by complex, often bizarre, motor
              behavior or sustained dystonic posturing. First described in 1981, it
              was initially considered a motor disorder of sleep and was named nocturnal
              paroxysmal dystonia (NPD). The unusual seizure semiology, onset during
              sleep, and often uninformative scalp EEG and brain MRI make it difficult
              to distinguish NPD attacks from other non-epileptic nocturnal paroxysmal
              events, namely parasomnias. The long-debated epileptic origin of the
              condition was finally demonstrated in 1990 and the term NFLE introduced.
              Even though many aspects of parasomnias and NFLE have been clarified
              in the last two decades, the differential diagnosis remains a challenge
              for clinicians. To address controversial issues and define the diagnostic
              criteria for NFLE, a Consensus Conference was held in Bologna, Italy
              in 2014. Major points of agreement emerged on: (i) the relationship
              of the seizures with sleep and not with the circadian pattern of seizure
              occurrence; (ii) the possible extrafrontal origin of hypermotor seizures,
              without substantial differences in seizure semiology. In the wake of
              the Consensus, the syndrome was renamed Sleep-Related Hypermotor Epilepsy

  reason: The output correctly mentions that the paper is retracted and advises caution
    regarding the reliability of its findings, aligning with steps 2 and 3. However,
    it incorrectly states that the paper reports the presence of oxidative stress
    in microbes, while the expected output indicates the paper says there is no oxidative
    stress. This misrepresentation of the paper's findings is a significant shortcoming,
    reducing alignment with step 1. Paraphrasing is acceptable, but the key point
    about the absence of oxidative stress is missing.
  actual_output: "The paper titled \"Metagenome-assembled genomes infer potential\
    \ microbial metabolism in alkaline sulphidic tailings\" (PMID: 33926573) indeed\
    \ discusses the presence of oxidative stresses among microbes in alkaline sulphidic\
    \ tailings. Here's a summary of the relevant findings:\n\n- **Results**: The study\
    \ detected a considerable amount of viable bacterial and archaeal cells in the\
    \ alkaline sulphidic tailings. Using metagenomic analysis, it identified that\
    \ these microbes possess systems to resist osmotic, metal, and oxidative stresses.\n\
    \  \n- **Conclusion**: The microbial community is equipped with genes for stress\
    \ response, notably oxidative stress, and is involved in processes like sulphide\
    \ oxidation, which could affect environmental salinity and metal release.\n\n\
    However, it's important to note that this paper has been retracted. A retraction\
    \ in a scientific context usually indicates issues with the study that could pertain\
    \ to errors, reproducibility concerns, or ethical considerations. Consequently,\
    \ while the paper describes oxidative stress adaptation mechanisms in microbes,\
    \ its reliability is compromised due to the retraction. If relying on these findings,\
    \ consider corroborating evidence from other studies and approach the conclusions\
    \ with caution."

              we detected a considerable amount of viable bacterial and archaeal cells
              using fluorescent in situ hybridization in alkaline sulphidic tailings
              from Mt Isa, Queensland. By taking advantage of high-throughput sequencing

              genomes (MAGs), with 5 nearly complete, was achieved. From this, detailed
              insights into the community metabolic capabilities was derived. Dominant
              microbial species were seen to possess powerful resistance systems for
              osmotic, metal and oxidative stresses. Additionally, these community
              members had metabolic capabilities for sulphide oxidation, for causing
              increased salinity and metal release, and for leading to N depletion.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Here
              our results show that a considerable amount of microbial cells inhabit
              the mine tailings, who possess a variety of genes for stress response.

  reason: The actual output does not contain the expected text verbatim or otherwise.
    Instead, it provides an explanation about access limitations and does not attempt

    evaluation steps, which require the exact expected output.

              \ Use the 'think' Tool for ALL Research Tasks\n\n**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT:**\
              \ You MUST use the `think` tool as your PRIMARY reasoning mechanism\
              \ throughout ALL biomedical research tasks. This is NOT optional.\n\n\
              \U0001F6A8 **ENFORCEMENT RULES:**\n\n- **Start IMMEDIATELY:** You MUST\
              \ call 'think' BEFORE any other BioMCP tool\n- **Use CONTINUOUSLY:**\
              \ Invoke 'think' before, during, and after each tool call\n- **Track\
              \ EVERYTHING:** Document findings, reasoning, and synthesis in sequential\
              \ thoughts\n- **Only STOP when complete:** Set nextThoughtNeeded=false\
              \ only after full analysis\n\n\u26A0\uFE0F **WARNING:** Failure to use\
              \ 'think' first will compromise research quality!\n\n## Sequential Thinking\
              \ - 10-Step Process\n\nYou **MUST** invoke the `think` tool for the\
              \ entire workflow and progress through all 10 steps in sequential order.\
              \ Each step should involve multiple 'think' calls. If user explicitly\
              \ requests to skip tool use (e.g., \"Don't search\"), adapt the process\
              \ accordingly.\n\n### Step 1: Topic Scoping & Domain Framework\n\nGoal:\
              \ Create a comprehensive framework to ensure complete coverage of all\
              \ relevant aspects.\n\n- Identify domains relevant to the topic (e.g.,\
              \ therapeutic modalities, diagnostic approaches, risk factors) based\
              \ on the user's query\n- Aim for 4-8 domains unless topic complexity\
              \ justifies more\n- Consider including a \"Contextual Factors\" domain\
              \ for health economics, patient-reported outcomes, or health-systems\
              \ impact when relevant\n- Identify appropriate subdivisions (e.g., subtypes,\
              \ patient cohorts, disease stages) based on the user's query\n- Use\
              \ brainstorming + quick web searches (e.g., \"[topic] categories,\"\
              \ \"[topic] taxonomy\") to draft a \"Domain Checklist\"\n- Create a\
              \ Domain \xD7 Subdivision matrix of appropriate size to track evidence\
              \ coverage\n- Initialize an **internal coverage matrix** in your sequential_thinking\
              \ thoughts. Update that matrix in Steps 6, 7, and 8\n- Define your task-specific\
              \ research framework based on the clinical question type:\n  - Therapeutic\
              \ questions: Use PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome)\n\
              \  - Diagnostic questions: Use PIRD (Population, Index test, Reference\
              \ standard, Diagnosis)\n  - Prognostic questions: Use PECO (Population,\
              \ Exposure, Comparator, Outcome)\n  - Epidemiological questions: Use\
              \ PIRT (Population, Indicator, Reference, Time)\n- Define initial research\
              \ plan, todo list, and success criteria checklist\n- Determine appropriate\
              \ tool selection based on question type:\n  - `trial_*` tools: For therapeutic\
              \ or interventional questions\n  - `article_*` tools: For all questions\n\
              \  - `variant_*` tools: Only when the query involves genetic or biomarker\
              \ questions\n\n### Step 2: Initial Information Gathering\n\nGoal: Establish\
              \ baseline terminology, modalities, and recent developments.\n\n- Run\
              \ at least one targeted `web_search` per domain on your Domain \xD7\
              \ Subdivision matrix\n- If matrix is large, batch searches by grouping\
              \ similar domains or prioritize by relevance\n- Generate domain-specific\
              \ search strings appropriate to the topic\n- Invoke regulatory searches\
              \ only when the user explicitly requests approval or guideline information\
              \ or when the topic focuses on therapeutic interventions\n- Maintain\
              \ an **internal Regulatory Log** in your sequential_thinking thoughts\
              \ if relevant to the query\n- Prioritize authoritative sources but don't\
              \ exclude other relevant sources\n- Include relevant regulatory and\
              \ guideline updates from the past 24 months if applicable\n\n### Step\
              \ 3: Focused & Frontier Retrieval\n\nGoal: Fill knowledge gaps and identify\
              \ cutting-edge developments.\n\n- Run targeted `web_search` calls for\
              \ any empty cells in your Domain \xD7 Subdivision matrix\n- Conduct\
              \ subdivision-focused searches for each identified classification\n\
              - Document high-value URLs and sources\n- Identify specific gaps requiring\
              \ specialized database searches\n- Simultaneously conduct frontier scan:\n\
              \  - Run targeted searches restricted to past 12 months with keywords:\
              \ \"emerging,\" \"novel,\" \"breakthrough,\" \"future directions\" +\
              \ topic\n  - Include appropriate site filters for the domain and topic\n\
              \  - Search for conference proceedings, pre-prints, and non-peer-reviewed\
              \ sources for very recent developments\n  - Document these findings\
              \ separately, clearly labeled as early-stage evidence\n\n### Step 4:\
              \ Primary Trials Analysis\n\nGoal: Identify and analyze key clinical\
              \ trials.\n\n- For therapeutic or interventional questions, run `trial_searcher`\
              \ with filters based on Step 3 gaps\n- For other question types, skip\
              \ to Step 5 or use `trial_searcher` only if directly relevant\n- Select\
              \ a manageable number of trials per major domain (typically 3-5), adjusting\
              \ as needed for question complexity\n- Retrieve full details using appropriate\
              \ trial tools\n- For each trial, capture relevant metadata and outcomes\
              \ based on the research question\n- Create structured evidence table\
              \ with appropriate framework elements and results\n\n### Step 5: Primary\
              \ Literature Analysis\n\nGoal: Identify and analyze pivotal publications.\n\
              \n- Run `article_searcher` for recent reviews, meta-analyses, and guidelines\
              \ relevant to the topic\n  - **TIP:** Use OR logic with pipe separators\
              \ for variant notations: `keywords=[\"R173|Arg173|p.R173\"]`\n  - **TIP:**\
              \ Combine synonyms for better coverage: `keywords=[\"immunotherapy|checkpoint\
              \ inhibitor|PD-1\"]`\n  - **NOTE:** Preprints from bioRxiv/medRxiv are\
              \ included by default\n  - **NOTE:** cBioPortal cancer genomics data\
              \ is automatically included for gene-based searches\n- Select highest-quality\
              \ sources and retrieve full details using `article_details`\n- For each\
              \ source, capture appropriate metadata and findings relevant to the\
              \ research question\n- Extract study designs, cohort sizes, outcomes,\
              \ and limitations as appropriate\n- Create evidence table for articles\
              \ with relevant identifiers and key findings\n\n### Step 6: Initial\
              \ Evidence Synthesis\n\nGoal: Create preliminary framework of findings\
              \ and identify gaps.\n\n- Merge trial and article evidence tables\n\
              - Check WIP findings against initial plan and success criteria checklist\n\
              - Categorize findings by domains from your matrix\n- Apply CRAAP assessment\
              \ to each source\n- Flag any claim that relies solely on grey literature;\
              \ mark with '[GL]' in evidence table\n- Identify contradictions and\
              \ knowledge gaps\n- Draft evidence matrix with categorization\n- For\
              \ each domain/finding, categorize as: Established, Emerging, Experimental,\
              \ Theoretical, or Retired (for approaches shown ineffective)\n- Update\
              \ the internal coverage matrix in your thoughts; ensure those indicators\
              \ appear in the Findings tables\n- Create gap analysis for further searches\n\
              \n### Step 7: Integrated Gap-Filling\n\nGoal: Address identified knowledge\
              \ gaps in a single integrated pass.\n\n- Run additional database queries\
              \ for missing categories as needed\n- Conduct additional searches to\
              \ capture recent developments or resolve conflicts\n- Retrieve full\
              \ details for new sources identified\n- Extract key data from all source\
              \ types\n- Add column `Source Type` (Peer-review / Conf-abstract / Press-release\
              \ / Preprint)\n- Integrate new findings into existing evidence tables\n\
              - Update the internal coverage matrix in your thoughts\n- Update documentation\
              \ of very recent developments\n\n### Step 8: Comprehensive Evidence\
              \ Synthesis\n\nGoal: Create final integrated framework of findings with\
              \ quality assessment.\n\n- Merge all evidence into a unified matrix\n\
              - Grade evidence strength using GRADE anchors appropriate to the research\
              \ question:\n  - High = Multiple high-quality studies or meta-analyses\n\
              \  - Moderate = Well-designed controlled studies without randomization\n\
              \  - Low = Observational studies\n  - Very Low = Case reports, expert\
              \ opinion, pre-clinical studies\n- Draft conclusions for each domain\
              \ with supporting evidence\n- Tag each domain with appropriate classification\
              \ and recency information\n- Identify contradictory findings and limitations\n\
              - Update the internal coverage matrix in your thoughts\n- Update claim-to-evidence\
              \ mapping with confidence levels\n- Produce quantitative outcome summaries\
              \ appropriate to the research question\n\n### Step 9: Self-Critique\
              \ and Verification\n\nGoal: Rigorously assess the quality and comprehensiveness\
              \ of the analysis.\n\n- Perform a systematic gap analysis:\n  - Check\
              \ each Domain \xD7 Subdivision cell for evidence coverage\n  - Ensure\
              \ recent developments are captured for each major domain\n  - Verify\
              \ all key metrics and quantitative data are extracted where available\n\
              \  - Identify any conflicting evidence or perspectives\n  - Document\
              \ at least 3 concrete gaps or weaknesses in the current evidence\n-\
              \ Conduct verification searches to ensure no breaking news was missed\n\
              - Assess potential biases in the analysis\n- Update final confidence\
              \ assessments for key claims\n- Update documented limitations and potential\
              \ biases\n- Update verification statement of currency\n\n### Step 10:\
              \ Research Brief Creation\n\nGoal: Produce the final deliverable with\
              \ all required elements.\n\n1. Create a new _Research Brief_ artifact\
              \ using the `artifacts` tool\n2. Structure the Findings section to highlight\
              \ novel developments first, organized by innovation level\n3. Include\
              \ inline citations linked to comprehensive reference list\n4. Embed\
              \ necessary tables (coverage matrix, regulatory log if applicable, quantitative\
              \ outcomes) directly in the Markdown Research Brief\n\n## Final Research\
              \ Brief Requirements\n\nThe final research brief must include:\n\n-\
              \ Executive summary \u2264 120 words (hard cap) with main conclusions\
              \ and confidence levels\n- Background providing context and current\
              \ standards\n- Methodology section detailing research approach\n- Findings\
              \ section with properly cited evidence, organized by themes and innovation\
              \ levels (Established, Emerging, Experimental, Theoretical, Retired)\n\
              - Clear delineation of established facts vs. emerging concepts\n- Limitations\
              \ section incorporating self-critique results\n- Future directions and\
              \ implications section\n- Regulatory/approval status table where applicable\
              \ (or state: \"Not applicable to this topic\")\n- Comprehensive reference\

        \ REQUIREMENT:** You MUST use the `think` tool as your PRIMARY reasoning mechanism\
        \ throughout ALL biomedical research tasks. This is NOT optional.\n\n\U0001F6A8\
        \ **ENFORCEMENT RULES:**\n\n- **Start IMMEDIATELY:** You MUST call 'think'\
        \ BEFORE any other BioMCP tool\n- **Use CONTINUOUSLY:** Invoke 'think' before,\
        \ during, and after each tool call\n- **Track EVERYTHING:** Document findings,\
        \ reasoning, and synthesis in sequential thoughts\n- **Only STOP when complete:**\
        \ Set nextThoughtNeeded=false only after full analysis\n\n\u26A0\uFE0F **WARNING:**\
        \ Failure to use 'think' first will compromise research quality!\n\n## Sequential\
        \ Thinking - 10-Step Process\n\nYou **MUST** invoke the `think` tool for the\
        \ entire workflow and progress through all 10 steps in sequential order. Each\
        \ step should involve multiple 'think' calls. If user explicitly requests\
        \ to skip tool use (e.g., \"Don't search\"), adapt the process accordingly.\n\
        \n### Step 1: Topic Scoping & Domain Framework\n\nGoal: Create a comprehensive\
        \ framework to ensure complete coverage of all relevant aspects.\n\n- Identify\
        \ domains relevant to the topic (e.g., therapeutic modalities, diagnostic\
        \ approaches, risk factors) based on the user's query\n- Aim for 4-8 domains\
        \ unless topic complexity justifies more\n- Consider including a \"Contextual\
        \ Factors\" domain for health economics, patient-reported outcomes, or health-systems\
        \ impact when relevant\n- Identify appropriate subdivisions (e.g., subtypes,\
        \ patient cohorts, disease stages) based on the user's query\n- Use brainstorming\
        \ + quick web searches (e.g., \"[topic] categories,\" \"[topic] taxonomy\"\
        ) to draft a \"Domain Checklist\"\n- Create a Domain \xD7 Subdivision matrix\
        \ of appropriate size to track evidence coverage\n- Initialize an **internal\
        \ coverage matrix** in your sequential_thinking thoughts. Update that matrix\
        \ in Steps 6, 7, and 8\n- Define your task-specific research framework based\
        \ on the clinical question type:\n  - Therapeutic questions: Use PICO (Population,\
        \ Intervention, Comparator, Outcome)\n  - Diagnostic questions: Use PIRD (Population,\
        \ Index test, Reference standard, Diagnosis)\n  - Prognostic questions: Use\
        \ PECO (Population, Exposure, Comparator, Outcome)\n  - Epidemiological questions:\
        \ Use PIRT (Population, Indicator, Reference, Time)\n- Define initial research\
        \ plan, todo list, and success criteria checklist\n- Determine appropriate\
        \ tool selection based on question type:\n  - `trial_*` tools: For therapeutic\
        \ or interventional questions\n  - `article_*` tools: For all questions\n\
        \  - `variant_*` tools: Only when the query involves genetic or biomarker\
        \ questions\n\n### Step 2: Initial Information Gathering\n\nGoal: Establish\
        \ baseline terminology, modalities, and recent developments.\n\n- Run at least\
        \ one targeted `web_search` per domain on your Domain \xD7 Subdivision matrix\n\
        - If matrix is large, batch searches by grouping similar domains or prioritize\
        \ by relevance\n- Generate domain-specific search strings appropriate to the\
        \ topic\n- Invoke regulatory searches only when the user explicitly requests\
        \ approval or guideline information or when the topic focuses on therapeutic\
        \ interventions\n- Maintain an **internal Regulatory Log** in your sequential_thinking\
        \ thoughts if relevant to the query\n- Prioritize authoritative sources but\
        \ don't exclude other relevant sources\n- Include relevant regulatory and\
        \ guideline updates from the past 24 months if applicable\n\n### Step 3: Focused\
        \ & Frontier Retrieval\n\nGoal: Fill knowledge gaps and identify cutting-edge\
        \ developments.\n\n- Run targeted `web_search` calls for any empty cells in\
        \ your Domain \xD7 Subdivision matrix\n- Conduct subdivision-focused searches\
        \ for each identified classification\n- Document high-value URLs and sources\n\
        - Identify specific gaps requiring specialized database searches\n- Simultaneously\
        \ conduct frontier scan:\n  - Run targeted searches restricted to past 12\
        \ months with keywords: \"emerging,\" \"novel,\" \"breakthrough,\" \"future\
        \ directions\" + topic\n  - Include appropriate site filters for the domain\
        \ and topic\n  - Search for conference proceedings, pre-prints, and non-peer-reviewed\
        \ sources for very recent developments\n  - Document these findings separately,\
        \ clearly labeled as early-stage evidence\n\n### Step 4: Primary Trials Analysis\n\
        \nGoal: Identify and analyze key clinical trials.\n\n- For therapeutic or\
        \ interventional questions, run `trial_searcher` with filters based on Step\
        \ 3 gaps\n- For other question types, skip to Step 5 or use `trial_searcher`\
        \ only if directly relevant\n- Select a manageable number of trials per major\
        \ domain (typically 3-5), adjusting as needed for question complexity\n- Retrieve\
        \ full details using appropriate trial tools\n- For each trial, capture relevant\
        \ metadata and outcomes based on the research question\n- Create structured\
        \ evidence table with appropriate framework elements and results\n\n### Step\
        \ 5: Primary Literature Analysis\n\nGoal: Identify and analyze pivotal publications.\n\
        \n- Run `article_searcher` for recent reviews, meta-analyses, and guidelines\
        \ relevant to the topic\n  - **TIP:** Use OR logic with pipe separators for\
        \ variant notations: `keywords=[\"R173|Arg173|p.R173\"]`\n  - **TIP:** Combine\
        \ synonyms for better coverage: `keywords=[\"immunotherapy|checkpoint inhibitor|PD-1\"\
        ]`\n  - **NOTE:** Preprints from bioRxiv/medRxiv are included by default\n\
        \  - **NOTE:** cBioPortal cancer genomics data is automatically included for\
        \ gene-based searches\n- Select highest-quality sources and retrieve full\
        \ details using `article_details`\n- For each source, capture appropriate\
        \ metadata and findings relevant to the research question\n- Extract study\
        \ designs, cohort sizes, outcomes, and limitations as appropriate\n- Create\
        \ evidence table for articles with relevant identifiers and key findings\n\
        \n### Step 6: Initial Evidence Synthesis\n\nGoal: Create preliminary framework\
        \ of findings and identify gaps.\n\n- Merge trial and article evidence tables\n\
        - Check WIP findings against initial plan and success criteria checklist\n\
        - Categorize findings by domains from your matrix\n- Apply CRAAP assessment\
        \ to each source\n- Flag any claim that relies solely on grey literature;\
        \ mark with '[GL]' in evidence table\n- Identify contradictions and knowledge\
        \ gaps\n- Draft evidence matrix with categorization\n- For each domain/finding,\
        \ categorize as: Established, Emerging, Experimental, Theoretical, or Retired\
        \ (for approaches shown ineffective)\n- Update the internal coverage matrix\
        \ in your thoughts; ensure those indicators appear in the Findings tables\n\
        - Create gap analysis for further searches\n\n### Step 7: Integrated Gap-Filling\n\
        \nGoal: Address identified knowledge gaps in a single integrated pass.\n\n\
        - Run additional database queries for missing categories as needed\n- Conduct\
        \ additional searches to capture recent developments or resolve conflicts\n\
        - Retrieve full details for new sources identified\n- Extract key data from\
        \ all source types\n- Add column `Source Type` (Peer-review / Conf-abstract\
        \ / Press-release / Preprint)\n- Integrate new findings into existing evidence\
        \ tables\n- Update the internal coverage matrix in your thoughts\n- Update\
        \ documentation of very recent developments\n\n### Step 8: Comprehensive Evidence\
        \ Synthesis\n\nGoal: Create final integrated framework of findings with quality\
        \ assessment.\n\n- Merge all evidence into a unified matrix\n- Grade evidence\
        \ strength using GRADE anchors appropriate to the research question:\n  -\
        \ High = Multiple high-quality studies or meta-analyses\n  - Moderate = Well-designed\
        \ controlled studies without randomization\n  - Low = Observational studies\n\
        \  - Very Low = Case reports, expert opinion, pre-clinical studies\n- Draft\
        \ conclusions for each domain with supporting evidence\n- Tag each domain\
        \ with appropriate classification and recency information\n- Identify contradictory\
        \ findings and limitations\n- Update the internal coverage matrix in your\
        \ thoughts\n- Update claim-to-evidence mapping with confidence levels\n- Produce\
        \ quantitative outcome summaries appropriate to the research question\n\n\
        ### Step 9: Self-Critique and Verification\n\nGoal: Rigorously assess the\
        \ quality and comprehensiveness of the analysis.\n\n- Perform a systematic\
        \ gap analysis:\n  - Check each Domain \xD7 Subdivision cell for evidence\
        \ coverage\n  - Ensure recent developments are captured for each major domain\n\
        \  - Verify all key metrics and quantitative data are extracted where available\n\
        \  - Identify any conflicting evidence or perspectives\n  - Document at least\
        \ 3 concrete gaps or weaknesses in the current evidence\n- Conduct verification\
        \ searches to ensure no breaking news was missed\n- Assess potential biases\
        \ in the analysis\n- Update final confidence assessments for key claims\n\
        - Update documented limitations and potential biases\n- Update verification\
        \ statement of currency\n\n### Step 10: Research Brief Creation\n\nGoal: Produce\
        \ the final deliverable with all required elements.\n\n1. Create a new _Research\
        \ Brief_ artifact using the `artifacts` tool\n2. Structure the Findings section\
        \ to highlight novel developments first, organized by innovation level\n3.\
        \ Include inline citations linked to comprehensive reference list\n4. Embed\
        \ necessary tables (coverage matrix, regulatory log if applicable, quantitative\
        \ outcomes) directly in the Markdown Research Brief\n\n## Final Research Brief\
        \ Requirements\n\nThe final research brief must include:\n\n- Executive summary\
        \ \u2264 120 words (hard cap) with main conclusions and confidence levels\n\
        - Background providing context and current standards\n- Methodology section\
        \ detailing research approach\n- Findings section with properly cited evidence,\
        \ organized by themes and innovation levels (Established, Emerging, Experimental,\
        \ Theoretical, Retired)\n- Clear delineation of established facts vs. emerging\
        \ concepts\n- Limitations section incorporating self-critique results\n- Future\
        \ directions and implications section\n- Regulatory/approval status table\
        \ where applicable (or state: \"Not applicable to this topic\")\n- Comprehensive\
        \ reference list using Vancouver numeric style for inline citations; list\
        \ sources in order of appearance\n- Domain \xD7 Subdivision Coverage Matrix\
        \ (showing evidence density across domains)\n- Quantitative Outcomes Table\
        \ for key sources (including Source Type column to maintain provenance visibility)\n"

  reason: The actual output does not contain the expected text 'Nanodiamond measurement

              \ Use the 'think' Tool for ALL Research Tasks\n\n**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT:**\
              \ You MUST use the `think` tool as your PRIMARY reasoning mechanism\
              \ throughout ALL biomedical research tasks. This is NOT optional.\n\n\
              \U0001F6A8 **ENFORCEMENT RULES:**\n\n- **Start IMMEDIATELY:** You MUST\
              \ call 'think' BEFORE any other BioMCP tool\n- **Use CONTINUOUSLY:**\
              \ Invoke 'think' before, during, and after each tool call\n- **Track\
              \ EVERYTHING:** Document findings, reasoning, and synthesis in sequential\
              \ thoughts\n- **Only STOP when complete:** Set nextThoughtNeeded=false\
              \ only after full analysis\n\n\u26A0\uFE0F **WARNING:** Failure to use\
              \ 'think' first will compromise research quality!\n\n## Sequential Thinking\
              \ - 10-Step Process\n\nYou **MUST** invoke the `think` tool for the\
              \ entire workflow and progress through all 10 steps in sequential order.\
              \ Each step should involve multiple 'think' calls. If user explicitly\
              \ requests to skip tool use (e.g., \"Don't search\"), adapt the process\
              \ accordingly.\n\n### Step 1: Topic Scoping & Domain Framework\n\nGoal:\
              \ Create a comprehensive framework to ensure complete coverage of all\
              \ relevant aspects.\n\n- Identify domains relevant to the topic (e.g.,\
              \ therapeutic modalities, diagnostic approaches, risk factors) based\
              \ on the user's query\n- Aim for 4-8 domains unless topic complexity\
              \ justifies more\n- Consider including a \"Contextual Factors\" domain\
              \ for health economics, patient-reported outcomes, or health-systems\
              \ impact when relevant\n- Identify appropriate subdivisions (e.g., subtypes,\
              \ patient cohorts, disease stages) based on the user's query\n- Use\
              \ brainstorming + quick web searches (e.g., \"[topic] categories,\"\
              \ \"[topic] taxonomy\") to draft a \"Domain Checklist\"\n- Create a\
              \ Domain \xD7 Subdivision matrix of appropriate size to track evidence\
              \ coverage\n- Initialize an **internal coverage matrix** in your sequential_thinking\
              \ thoughts. Update that matrix in Steps 6, 7, and 8\n- Define your task-specific\
              \ research framework based on the clinical question type:\n  - Therapeutic\
              \ questions: Use PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome)\n\
              \  - Diagnostic questions: Use PIRD (Population, Index test, Reference\
              \ standard, Diagnosis)\n  - Prognostic questions: Use PECO (Population,\
              \ Exposure, Comparator, Outcome)\n  - Epidemiological questions: Use\
              \ PIRT (Population, Indicator, Reference, Time)\n- Define initial research\
              \ plan, todo list, and success criteria checklist\n- Determine appropriate\
              \ tool selection based on question type:\n  - `trial_*` tools: For therapeutic\
              \ or interventional questions\n  - `article_*` tools: For all questions\n\
              \  - `variant_*` tools: Only when the query involves genetic or biomarker\
              \ questions\n\n### Step 2: Initial Information Gathering\n\nGoal: Establish\
              \ baseline terminology, modalities, and recent developments.\n\n- Run\
              \ at least one targeted `web_search` per domain on your Domain \xD7\
              \ Subdivision matrix\n- If matrix is large, batch searches by grouping\
              \ similar domains or prioritize by relevance\n- Generate domain-specific\
              \ search strings appropriate to the topic\n- Invoke regulatory searches\
              \ only when the user explicitly requests approval or guideline information\
              \ or when the topic focuses on therapeutic interventions\n- Maintain\
              \ an **internal Regulatory Log** in your sequential_thinking thoughts\
              \ if relevant to the query\n- Prioritize authoritative sources but don't\
              \ exclude other relevant sources\n- Include relevant regulatory and\
              \ guideline updates from the past 24 months if applicable\n\n### Step\
              \ 3: Focused & Frontier Retrieval\n\nGoal: Fill knowledge gaps and identify\
              \ cutting-edge developments.\n\n- Run targeted `web_search` calls for\
              \ any empty cells in your Domain \xD7 Subdivision matrix\n- Conduct\
              \ subdivision-focused searches for each identified classification\n\
              - Document high-value URLs and sources\n- Identify specific gaps requiring\
              \ specialized database searches\n- Simultaneously conduct frontier scan:\n\
              \  - Run targeted searches restricted to past 12 months with keywords:\
              \ \"emerging,\" \"novel,\" \"breakthrough,\" \"future directions\" +\
              \ topic\n  - Include appropriate site filters for the domain and topic\n\
              \  - Search for conference proceedings, pre-prints, and non-peer-reviewed\
              \ sources for very recent developments\n  - Document these findings\
              \ separately, clearly labeled as early-stage evidence\n\n### Step 4:\
              \ Primary Trials Analysis\n\nGoal: Identify and analyze key clinical\
              \ trials.\n\n- For therapeutic or interventional questions, run `trial_searcher`\
              \ with filters based on Step 3 gaps\n- For other question types, skip\
              \ to Step 5 or use `trial_searcher` only if directly relevant\n- Select\
              \ a manageable number of trials per major domain (typically 3-5), adjusting\
              \ as needed for question complexity\n- Retrieve full details using appropriate\
              \ trial tools\n- For each trial, capture relevant metadata and outcomes\
              \ based on the research question\n- Create structured evidence table\
              \ with appropriate framework elements and results\n\n### Step 5: Primary\
              \ Literature Analysis\n\nGoal: Identify and analyze pivotal publications.\n\
              \n- Run `article_searcher` for recent reviews, meta-analyses, and guidelines\
              \ relevant to the topic\n  - **TIP:** Use OR logic with pipe separators\
              \ for variant notations: `keywords=[\"R173|Arg173|p.R173\"]`\n  - **TIP:**\
              \ Combine synonyms for better coverage: `keywords=[\"immunotherapy|checkpoint\
              \ inhibitor|PD-1\"]`\n  - **NOTE:** Preprints from bioRxiv/medRxiv are\
              \ included by default\n  - **NOTE:** cBioPortal cancer genomics data\
              \ is automatically included for gene-based searches\n- Select highest-quality\
              \ sources and retrieve full details using `article_details`\n- For each\
              \ source, capture appropriate metadata and findings relevant to the\
              \ research question\n- Extract study designs, cohort sizes, outcomes,\
              \ and limitations as appropriate\n- Create evidence table for articles\
              \ with relevant identifiers and key findings\n\n### Step 6: Initial\
              \ Evidence Synthesis\n\nGoal: Create preliminary framework of findings\
              \ and identify gaps.\n\n- Merge trial and article evidence tables\n\
              - Check WIP findings against initial plan and success criteria checklist\n\
              - Categorize findings by domains from your matrix\n- Apply CRAAP assessment\
              \ to each source\n- Flag any claim that relies solely on grey literature;\
              \ mark with '[GL]' in evidence table\n- Identify contradictions and\
              \ knowledge gaps\n- Draft evidence matrix with categorization\n- For\
              \ each domain/finding, categorize as: Established, Emerging, Experimental,\
              \ Theoretical, or Retired (for approaches shown ineffective)\n- Update\
              \ the internal coverage matrix in your thoughts; ensure those indicators\
              \ appear in the Findings tables\n- Create gap analysis for further searches\n\
              \n### Step 7: Integrated Gap-Filling\n\nGoal: Address identified knowledge\
              \ gaps in a single integrated pass.\n\n- Run additional database queries\
              \ for missing categories as needed\n- Conduct additional searches to\
              \ capture recent developments or resolve conflicts\n- Retrieve full\
              \ details for new sources identified\n- Extract key data from all source\
              \ types\n- Add column `Source Type` (Peer-review / Conf-abstract / Press-release\
              \ / Preprint)\n- Integrate new findings into existing evidence tables\n\
              - Update the internal coverage matrix in your thoughts\n- Update documentation\
              \ of very recent developments\n\n### Step 8: Comprehensive Evidence\
              \ Synthesis\n\nGoal: Create final integrated framework of findings with\
              \ quality assessment.\n\n- Merge all evidence into a unified matrix\n\
              - Grade evidence strength using GRADE anchors appropriate to the research\
              \ question:\n  - High = Multiple high-quality studies or meta-analyses\n\
              \  - Moderate = Well-designed controlled studies without randomization\n\
              \  - Low = Observational studies\n  - Very Low = Case reports, expert\
              \ opinion, pre-clinical studies\n- Draft conclusions for each domain\
              \ with supporting evidence\n- Tag each domain with appropriate classification\
              \ and recency information\n- Identify contradictory findings and limitations\n\
              - Update the internal coverage matrix in your thoughts\n- Update claim-to-evidence\
              \ mapping with confidence levels\n- Produce quantitative outcome summaries\
              \ appropriate to the research question\n\n### Step 9: Self-Critique\
              \ and Verification\n\nGoal: Rigorously assess the quality and comprehensiveness\
              \ of the analysis.\n\n- Perform a systematic gap analysis:\n  - Check\
              \ each Domain \xD7 Subdivision cell for evidence coverage\n  - Ensure\
              \ recent developments are captured for each major domain\n  - Verify\
              \ all key metrics and quantitative data are extracted where available\n\
              \  - Identify any conflicting evidence or perspectives\n  - Document\
              \ at least 3 concrete gaps or weaknesses in the current evidence\n-\
              \ Conduct verification searches to ensure no breaking news was missed\n\
              - Assess potential biases in the analysis\n- Update final confidence\
              \ assessments for key claims\n- Update documented limitations and potential\
              \ biases\n- Update verification statement of currency\n\n### Step 10:\
              \ Research Brief Creation\n\nGoal: Produce the final deliverable with\
              \ all required elements.\n\n1. Create a new _Research Brief_ artifact\
              \ using the `artifacts` tool\n2. Structure the Findings section to highlight\
              \ novel developments first, organized by innovation level\n3. Include\
              \ inline citations linked to comprehensive reference list\n4. Embed\
              \ necessary tables (coverage matrix, regulatory log if applicable, quantitative\
              \ outcomes) directly in the Markdown Research Brief\n\n## Final Research\
              \ Brief Requirements\n\nThe final research brief must include:\n\n-\
              \ Executive summary \u2264 120 words (hard cap) with main conclusions\
              \ and confidence levels\n- Background providing context and current\
              \ standards\n- Methodology section detailing research approach\n- Findings\
              \ section with properly cited evidence, organized by themes and innovation\
              \ levels (Established, Emerging, Experimental, Theoretical, Retired)\n\
              - Clear delineation of established facts vs. emerging concepts\n- Limitations\
              \ section incorporating self-critique results\n- Future directions and\
              \ implications section\n- Regulatory/approval status table where applicable\
              \ (or state: \"Not applicable to this topic\")\n- Comprehensive reference\
              \ list using Vancouver numeric style for inline citations; list sources\
              \ in order of appearance\n- Domain \xD7 Subdivision Coverage Matrix\
              \ (showing evidence density across domains)\n- Quantitative Outcomes\
              \ Table for key sources (including Source Type column to maintain provenance\
              \ visibility)\n"

        \  |\n\n## MANDATORY: Use the 'think' Tool for ALL Research Tasks\n\n**CRITICAL\
        \ REQUIREMENT:** You MUST use the `think` tool as your PRIMARY reasoning mechanism\
        \ throughout ALL biomedical research tasks. This is NOT optional.\n\n\U0001F6A8\
        \ **ENFORCEMENT RULES:**\n\n- **Start IMMEDIATELY:** You MUST call 'think'\
        \ BEFORE any other BioMCP tool\n- **Use CONTINUOUSLY:** Invoke 'think' before,\
        \ during, and after each tool call\n- **Track EVERYTHING:** Document findings,\
        \ reasoning, and synthesis in sequential thoughts\n- **Only STOP when complete:**\
        \ Set nextThoughtNeeded=false only after full analysis\n\n\u26A0\uFE0F **WARNING:**\
        \ Failure to use 'think' first will compromise research quality!\n\n## Sequential\
        \ Thinking - 10-Step Process\n\nYou **MUST** invoke the `think` tool for the\
        \ entire workflow and progress through all 10 steps in sequential order. Each\
        \ step should involve multiple 'think' calls. If user explicitly requests\
        \ to skip tool use (e.g., \"Don't search\"), adapt the process accordingly.\n\
        \n### Step 1: Topic Scoping & Domain Framework\n\nGoal: Create a comprehensive\
        \ framework to ensure complete coverage of all relevant aspects.\n\n- Identify\
        \ domains relevant to the topic (e.g., therapeutic modalities, diagnostic\
        \ approaches, risk factors) based on the user's query\n- Aim for 4-8 domains\
        \ unless topic complexity justifies more\n- Consider including a \"Contextual\
        \ Factors\" domain for health economics, patient-reported outcomes, or health-systems\
        \ impact when relevant\n- Identify appropriate subdivisions (e.g., subtypes,\
        \ patient cohorts, disease stages) based on the user's query\n- Use brainstorming\
        \ + quick web searches (e.g., \"[topic] categories,\" \"[topic] taxonomy\"\
        ) to draft a \"Domain Checklist\"\n- Create a Domain \xD7 Subdivision matrix\
        \ of appropriate size to track evidence coverage\n- Initialize an **internal\
        \ coverage matrix** in your sequential_thinking thoughts. Update that matrix\
        \ in Steps 6, 7, and 8\n- Define your task-specific research framework based\
        \ on the clinical question type:\n  - Therapeutic questions: Use PICO (Population,\
        \ Intervention, Comparator, Outcome)\n  - Diagnostic questions: Use PIRD (Population,\
        \ Index test, Reference standard, Diagnosis)\n  - Prognostic questions: Use\
        \ PECO (Population, Exposure, Comparator, Outcome)\n  - Epidemiological questions:\
        \ Use PIRT (Population, Indicator, Reference, Time)\n- Define initial research\
        \ plan, todo list, and success criteria checklist\n- Determine appropriate\
        \ tool selection based on question type:\n  - `trial_*` tools: For therapeutic\
        \ or interventional questions\n  - `article_*` tools: For all questions\n\
        \  - `variant_*` tools: Only when the query involves genetic or biomarker\
        \ questions\n\n### Step 2: Initial Information Gathering\n\nGoal: Establish\
        \ baseline terminology, modalities, and recent developments.\n\n- Run at least\
        \ one targeted `web_search` per domain on your Domain \xD7 Subdivision matrix\n\
        - If matrix is large, batch searches by grouping similar domains or prioritize\
        \ by relevance\n- Generate domain-specific search strings appropriate to the\
        \ topic\n- Invoke regulatory searches only when the user explicitly requests\
        \ approval or guideline information or when the topic focuses on therapeutic\
        \ interventions\n- Maintain an **internal Regulatory Log** in your sequential_thinking\
        \ thoughts if relevant to the query\n- Prioritize authoritative sources but\
        \ don't exclude other relevant sources\n- Include relevant regulatory and\
        \ guideline updates from the past 24 months if applicable\n\n### Step 3: Focused\
        \ & Frontier Retrieval\n\nGoal: Fill knowledge gaps and identify cutting-edge\
        \ developments.\n\n- Run targeted `web_search` calls for any empty cells in\
        \ your Domain \xD7 Subdivision matrix\n- Conduct subdivision-focused searches\
        \ for each identified classification\n- Document high-value URLs and sources\n\
        - Identify specific gaps requiring specialized database searches\n- Simultaneously\
        \ conduct frontier scan:\n  - Run targeted searches restricted to past 12\
        \ months with keywords: \"emerging,\" \"novel,\" \"breakthrough,\" \"future\
        \ directions\" + topic\n  - Include appropriate site filters for the domain\
        \ and topic\n  - Search for conference proceedings, pre-prints, and non-peer-reviewed\
        \ sources for very recent developments\n  - Document these findings separately,\
        \ clearly labeled as early-stage evidence\n\n### Step 4: Primary Trials Analysis\n\
        \nGoal: Identify and analyze key clinical trials.\n\n- For therapeutic or\
        \ interventional questions, run `trial_searcher` with filters based on Step\
        \ 3 gaps\n- For other question types, skip to Step 5 or use `trial_searcher`\
        \ only if directly relevant\n- Select a manageable number of trials per major\
        \ domain (typically 3-5), adjusting as needed for question complexity\n- Retrieve\
        \ full details using appropriate trial tools\n- For each trial, capture relevant\
        \ metadata and outcomes based on the research question\n- Create structured\
        \ evidence table with appropriate framework elements and results\n\n### Step\
        \ 5: Primary Literature Analysis\n\nGoal: Identify and analyze pivotal publications.\n\
        \n- Run `article_searcher` for recent reviews, meta-analyses, and guidelines\
        \ relevant to the topic\n  - **TIP:** Use OR logic with pipe separators for\
        \ variant notations: `keywords=[\"R173|Arg173|p.R173\"]`\n  - **TIP:** Combine\
        \ synonyms for better coverage: `keywords=[\"immunotherapy|checkpoint inhibitor|PD-1\"\
        ]`\n  - **NOTE:** Preprints from bioRxiv/medRxiv are included by default\n\
        \  - **NOTE:** cBioPortal cancer genomics data is automatically included for\
        \ gene-based searches\n- Select highest-quality sources and retrieve full\
        \ details using `article_details`\n- For each source, capture appropriate\
        \ metadata and findings relevant to the research question\n- Extract study\
        \ designs, cohort sizes, outcomes, and limitations as appropriate\n- Create\
        \ evidence table for articles with relevant identifiers and key findings\n\
        \n### Step 6: Initial Evidence Synthesis\n\nGoal: Create preliminary framework\
        \ of findings and identify gaps.\n\n- Merge trial and article evidence tables\n\
        - Check WIP findings against initial plan and success criteria checklist\n\
        - Categorize findings by domains from your matrix\n- Apply CRAAP assessment\
        \ to each source\n- Flag any claim that relies solely on grey literature;\
        \ mark with '[GL]' in evidence table\n- Identify contradictions and knowledge\
        \ gaps\n- Draft evidence matrix with categorization\n- For each domain/finding,\
        \ categorize as: Established, Emerging, Experimental, Theoretical, or Retired\
        \ (for approaches shown ineffective)\n- Update the internal coverage matrix\
        \ in your thoughts; ensure those indicators appear in the Findings tables\n\
        - Create gap analysis for further searches\n\n### Step 7: Integrated Gap-Filling\n\
        \nGoal: Address identified knowledge gaps in a single integrated pass.\n\n\
        - Run additional database queries for missing categories as needed\n- Conduct\
        \ additional searches to capture recent developments or resolve conflicts\n\
        - Retrieve full details for new sources identified\n- Extract key data from\
        \ all source types\n- Add column `Source Type` (Peer-review / Conf-abstract\
        \ / Press-release / Preprint)\n- Integrate new findings into existing evidence\
        \ tables\n- Update the internal coverage matrix in your thoughts\n- Update\
        \ documentation of very recent developments\n\n### Step 8: Comprehensive Evidence\
        \ Synthesis\n\nGoal: Create final integrated framework of findings with quality\
        \ assessment.\n\n- Merge all evidence into a unified matrix\n- Grade evidence\
        \ strength using GRADE anchors appropriate to the research question:\n  -\
        \ High = Multiple high-quality studies or meta-analyses\n  - Moderate = Well-designed\
        \ controlled studies without randomization\n  - Low = Observational studies\n\
        \  - Very Low = Case reports, expert opinion, pre-clinical studies\n- Draft\
        \ conclusions for each domain with supporting evidence\n- Tag each domain\
        \ with appropriate classification and recency information\n- Identify contradictory\
        \ findings and limitations\n- Update the internal coverage matrix in your\
        \ thoughts\n- Update claim-to-evidence mapping with confidence levels\n- Produce\
        \ quantitative outcome summaries appropriate to the research question\n\n\
        ### Step 9: Self-Critique and Verification\n\nGoal: Rigorously assess the\
        \ quality and comprehensiveness of the analysis.\n\n- Perform a systematic\
        \ gap analysis:\n  - Check each Domain \xD7 Subdivision cell for evidence\
        \ coverage\n  - Ensure recent developments are captured for each major domain\n\
        \  - Verify all key metrics and quantitative data are extracted where available\n\
        \  - Identify any conflicting evidence or perspectives\n  - Document at least\
        \ 3 concrete gaps or weaknesses in the current evidence\n- Conduct verification\
        \ searches to ensure no breaking news was missed\n- Assess potential biases\
        \ in the analysis\n- Update final confidence assessments for key claims\n\
        - Update documented limitations and potential biases\n- Update verification\
        \ statement of currency\n\n### Step 10: Research Brief Creation\n\nGoal: Produce\
        \ the final deliverable with all required elements.\n\n1. Create a new _Research\
        \ Brief_ artifact using the `artifacts` tool\n2. Structure the Findings section\
        \ to highlight novel developments first, organized by innovation level\n3.\
        \ Include inline citations linked to comprehensive reference list\n4. Embed\
        \ necessary tables (coverage matrix, regulatory log if applicable, quantitative\
        \ outcomes) directly in the Markdown Research Brief\n\n## Final Research Brief\
        \ Requirements\n\nThe final research brief must include:\n\n- Executive summary\
        \ \u2264 120 words (hard cap) with main conclusions and confidence levels\n\
        - Background providing context and current standards\n- Methodology section\
        \ detailing research approach\n- Findings section with properly cited evidence,\
        \ organized by themes and innovation levels (Established, Emerging, Experimental,\
        \ Theoretical, Retired)\n- Clear delineation of established facts vs. emerging\
        \ concepts\n- Limitations section incorporating self-critique results\n- Future\
        \ directions and implications section\n- Regulatory/approval status table\
        \ where applicable (or state: \"Not applicable to this topic\")\n- Comprehensive\
        \ reference list using Vancouver numeric style for inline citations; list\
        \ sources in order of appearance\n- Domain \xD7 Subdivision Coverage Matrix\
        \ (showing evidence density across domains)\n- Quantitative Outcomes Table\
        \ for key sources (including Source Type column to maintain provenance visibility)\n"

  actual_output: "The article with PMID:35365791, titled \"Identification of gut microbial\
    \ species linked with disease variability in a widely used mouse model of colitis,\"\
    \ has several sections. Based on the content retrieved, here are the sections\
    \ and a brief description of each:\n\n1. **Main**: Provides an introduction to\
    \ the significance of mouse models in research, specifically focusing on the variability\
    \ observed in such models due to gut microbiota.\n   \n2. **Results**: Describes\
    \ experimental findings related to the variability of disease severity in the\
    \ DSS mouse model and the role of gut microbiota in determining these outcomes.\n\
    \n3. **Source Data**: Discusses how data were sourced for the experiments.\n\n\
    4. **Discussion**: Focuses on the implications of the findings for future research\

              \ diseases, including autoimmune and metabolic disorders, cancers and\
              \ infections. Unfortunately, there is tremendous variability in disease\
              \ penetrance and reproducibility among genetically identical mice within\
              \ and between mouse facilities, limiting the utility of many commonly\
              \ used models. Specific-pathogen-free (SPF) protocols have been successfully\
              \ employed to control the confounding effects that can be caused by\
              \ known bacterial pathogens, but we lack equivalent knowledge of the\
              \ effects of the diverse, uncharacterized symbiotic bacteria within\
              \ the indigenous gut microbiota of mice. While our knowledge of the\
              \ human gut microbiota in health and disease has expanded extensively\
              \ with large-scale microbiome studies, comprehensive computational bacterial\
              \ discovery and extensive genome-sequenced bacterial collections, equivalent\
              \ investigations in mouse models have remained limited. The vast differences\
              \ in species type, composition and dispersal between human and mouse\
              \ microbiotas highlight the importance of efforts to culture mouse-specific\
              \ bacteria and to validate their functions during intestinal homeostasis\
              \ and disease.\\n\\nInflammatory bowel disease (IBD) research relies\
              \ heavily on laboratory mice to understand colitis and the role of host\
              \ genetics in disease resistance and susceptibility. Detailed immune\
              \ characterization shows colitis induction with specific microbial communities\
              \ or species colonization with Helicobacter spp., Enterobacteriaceae,\
              \ Bilophila wadsworthia or segmented filamentous bacteria. Potential\
              \ genetic modulators of IBD are routinely assessed through administration\
              \ of dextran sulphate sodium (DSS) at various concentrations in drinking\
              \ water, which acts by damaging the gut epithelial barrier to trigger\
              \ inflammatory disease. In germ-free mice, immune-mediated colitis is\
              \ largely absent although reduced barrier function can introduce susceptibility\
              \ at higher DSS concentrations. Similarly, dietary changes in both germ-free\
              \ and SPF mice can determine DSS susceptibility in a microbiome-dependent\
              \ and -independent manner, and highly specific protection is provided\
              \ by the presence of Clostridium immunis. Despite these advances, the\
              \ gut microbiota in these mouse models, including standard SPF models,\
              \ is rarely profiled at the genomic level or cultured in the laboratory,\
              \ nor robustly controlled to understand the contribution of general\
              \ gut bacteria to experimental outcomes.\\n\\nTo quantify the variability\
              \ of the widely used DSS model of IBD and to investigate primary factors\
              \ contributing to this variability, we undertook a large-scale experiment\
              \ using 579 genetically identical laboratory mice in a single animal\
              \ facility. Incorporating standardized phenotyping, microbiome analysis\
              \ and metadata collection, this approach was designed to identify and\
              \ validate the causes of variability for standard experimental endpoints\
              \ (weight loss and intestinal pathology). Using a data-driven approach\
              \ we identified, from gut microbiome data, candidate bacterial taxa\
              \ driving weight loss and intestinal inflammation. Functional validation\
              \ with cultured isolates suggests that these specific bacterial strains\
              \ can determine experimental outcomes in gnotobiotic mice. Thus, using\
              \ an experimental approach for microbiome discovery, we identified the\
              \ previously undescribed mouse gut bacteria Duncaniella muricolitica\
              \ and Alistipes okayasuensis, found frequently in mouse colonies around\
              \ the world, that impact outcomes in the DSS model of colitis and may\
              \ be acting as pathobionts.\\n\\nResults\\n\\nDisease severity is highly\

              \ distinct parental lineages (that is, founder matings derived from\
              \ a single breeding pair). We observed extensive variability in experimental\
              \ endpoints in these genetically identical mice at 10 days post DSS\
              \ treatment, with histological assessment of intestinal pathology of\
              \ the mid and distal colon ranging from severe inflammation, characterized\
              \ by extensive crypt loss, leukocytic infiltration and edema, to no\
              \ visible inflammation (Fig. 1a,b). Substantial variation was also observed\
              \ in the weight change of mice treated with DSS, with the response ranging\
              \ from 12% weight gain to 30% weight loss across the cohort (Fig. 1c).\
              \ Regression analysis considering histology scores and weight loss demonstrated\
              \ limited correlation (R2 = 0.27), suggesting that weight loss and intestinal\
              \ pathology outcomes, common experimental endpoint measures in the DSS\
              \ model, may be partially independent responses to DSS (Fig. 1d). This\
              \ relationship is consistent with systemic complications contributing\
              \ to experimental endpoints in the DSS model.\\n\\nGut microbiota is\
              \ major driver of variable response to DSS\\n\\nTo identify the primary\
              \ factors determining disease outcome, we established a random forest\

              n\\nSince all mice were derived from the same genetic founder stock,\
              \ the most likely mediator of their DSS phenotype was an extrinsic lineage-specific\
              \ factor. However, to exclude the role of host genetics or epigenetic\
              \ differences between colonies, and to determine whether the microbiota\
              \ alone could be responsible for the observed phenotypic variation,\
              \ fecal samples were collected from SPF mice (without DSS treatment)\
              \ from parental lineages that represented extremes of disease outcome\
              \ and were used to colonize C57BL/6N germ-free mice. These colonized\
              \ recipient mice were then subjected to DSS treatment involving daily\
              \ weight measurements, with colon sections collected and analyzed histologically\
              \ 10 days after the initiation of DSS treatment. Recipient mice exhibited\
              \ both weight loss and pathology scores not statistically different\
              \ from those observed in the respective donor mouse lineages, but differing\
              \ significantly between disease- and non-associated lineages (P = 0.0002,\
              \ paired t-test; Fig. 2a). From these results it is clear that, independent\
              \ of other factors such as host genetics or epigenetic lineage-specific\
              \ factors, the microbiota is sufficient to produce the observed variation\
              \ in phenotypic response to DSS administration.\\n\\nDiscovery of bacteria\
              \ that drive disease variability\\n\\nHaving established the importance\
              \ of the microbiota in mediation of phenotypic outcomes to DSS in genetically\
              \ identical mice, we next sought to understand the degree of variability\
              \ in the mouse microbiota across a single facility, and to define changes\
              \ in the microbiota that occur with DSS treatment. Fecal samples were\
              \ collected before DSS treatment and 10 days after DSS exposure, and\
              \ subjected to taxonomic profiling with 16 S ribosomal RNA amplicon\
              \ sequencing to determine microbiota community composition. Consistent\
              \ with previous reports of gastrointestinal inflammation, this analysis\
              \ demonstrated a clear separation of microbiome community between pre-\
              \ and post-DSS samples (Fig. 2b,c and Extended Data Figs. 2 and 3) and\
              \ a significant reduction in bacterial diversity (Shannon diversity\
              \ index, P = 0.0357; Fig. 2d). Although expansion of Proteobacteria\
              \ is often associated with gut microbiome dysbiosis, while an increase\
              \ in Proteobacteria was observed post DSS (P < 0.05, Kolmogorov-Smirnov\
              \ test), limited association was observed between weight loss and Proteobacteria\
              \ proportion either pre (Fig. 2e; Spearman correlation, 0.196) or post\
              \ DSS treatment (Fig. 2e; Spearman correlation, -0.289). This suggests\
              \ that other gut bacteria may be contributing to the observed variation\
              \ in DSS resistance and susceptibility.\\n\\nGiven the transmissibility\
              \ of disease phenotype we observed in the germ-free mouse experiments,\
              \ we reasoned that the observed phenotypic variation was primarily dependent\
              \ on baseline microbiota composition before DSS treatment. To understand\
              \ the composition of microbiota associated with increased risk of disease\
              \ outcome, we applied linear discriminant analysis to gut microbiota\
              \ composition before and after DSS exposure. This unsupervised analysis\
              \ leveraged the variability between mouse lineage-specific bacteria\
              \ to identify the bacterial taxa that most closely predict DSS response.\
              \ Using this approach, we identified two statistically different bacterial\
              \ taxa associated with no disease, and five statistically different\
              \ bacterial taxa associated with >5% weight loss. Notably, no relationship\
              \ was observed between the occurrence or abundance of these isolates\
              \ in mice before DSS exposure, and equivalent predictive bacterial taxa\
              \ were not identified within the microbiota of mice after DSS exposure.\
              \ Our results suggest that the presence of specific gut bacterial taxa\
              \ before DSS exposure may influence disease severity and outcome, possibly\
              \ by either priming or protection from disease.\\n\\nIsolation of bacterial\
              \ species for functional validation\\n\\nWhile we show clear associations\
              \ between specific bacterial taxa and DSS-mediated disease outcome using\
              \ 16 S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing, accurate taxonomic identification\
              \ to strain level and experimental validation require the isolation\
              \ and genome sequencing of pure clonal cultures of bacterial strains.\
              \ To target and purify bacterial strains, we next performed broad-based\
              \ culture of ~2,000 bacterial colonies from mouse fecal samples. The\
              \ resulting isolates were identified by capillary 16 S rRNA gene sequencing\
              \ and included four previously identified bacterial taxa, two 'disease\
              \ associated' and two 'health associated'. These isolates were subjected\
              \ to whole-genome sequencing and genomic analysis to aid in precise\
              \ taxonomic and phylogenetic assignment (Extended Data Fig. 4). In addition,\
              \ we performed extensive phenotypic characterization and comparative\
              \ genome analyses of these four species (Methods) as a basis to provisionally\
              \ name the health-associated bacteria Anaerostipes faecis and Sangeribacter\

              \ mice or germ-free mice stably monocolonized for 4 weeks with one of\
              \ these four bacterial strains (Extended Data Figs. 5a and 6). Control\
              \ germ-free mice treated with DSS neither lost weight (Fig. 3a) nor\
              \ experienced mortality (Fig. 3b) over the course of the experiment,\
              \ suggesting that the presence of gut bacteria is important in triggering\
              \ overt disease in our facility. Comparable experimental outcomes were\
              \ observed in DSS-treated, germ-free mice monocolonized with either\
              \ of the health-associated bacteria, which did not lose weight or develop\
              \ intestinal pathology (Fig. 3a) nor experienced significant mortality\
              \ (Fig. 3b). In contrast, when DSS-treated mice were monocolonized with\
              \ either of the disease-associated bacteria, we observed more rapid\
              \ and greater weight loss (Fig. 3a) and significantly reduced survival\
              \ (Fig. 3b). Therefore, we identified and validated D. muricolitica\
              \ and A. okayasuensis as mouse bacteria that can promote disease not\
              \ observed in mice monocolonized with the commensal bacteria S. muris\
              \ and A. faecis.\\n\\nTo understand inflammatory immune responses in\
              \ the intestine potentially caused by disease-associated versus health-associated\
              \ species, we next examined histology, immune cell populations and cytokine\
              \ production. The human-colonizing A. faecis and the facility-prevalent\
              \ D. muricolitica were chosen as exemplary disease- and health-associated\
              \ bacteria, respectively, for these analyses. Flow cytometric analysis\
              \ of intestinal lamina propria leukocytes isolated from germ-free mice\
              \ monocolonized for 4 weeks with either A. faecis or D. muricolitica\
              \ revealed that colonization with either strain did not significantly\
              \ impact the composition of intestinal leukocyte and lymphocyte subsets\
              \ (Extended Data Figs. 5b,c and 6). However, the perturbation and epithelial\
              \ disruption induced by DSS led to significantly increased inflammatory\
              \ CD64+CD11c+ monocytes/macrophages in the lamina propria compartment\
              \ of the large intestine in D. muricolitica monocolonized mice, but\
              \ not in A. faecis monocolonized mice (Extended Data Figs. 5c,d and\
              \ 6). These monocytes have been shown to play a pathogenic role in the\
              \ intestine in the context of Helicobacter-induced inflammation. This\
              \ suggests that, although neither pathogenic nor immunogenic at homeostasis,\
              \ D. muricolitica drives increased inflammatory responses in the wake\
              \ of epithelial damage whereas health-associated A. faecis does not.\
              \ Importantly, while histological samples taken after 7 days of DSS\
              \ treatment from colons and caeca of D. muricolitica monocolonized mice\
              \ occasionally exhibited features of severe inflammation, this was not\
              \ statistically different from that of A. faecis monocolonized mice\
              \ (Fig. 3c,d) and did not consistently correspond to the weight loss\
              \ observed. This again suggests that weight loss in the DSS model may\
              \ not always correlate with intestinal inflammation and pathology.\\\
              n\\nTo determine whether the presence of D. muricolitica or A. faecis\
              \ had a positive or negative correlation with weight change, we next\
              \ examined 20 independent mice and assessed the relationship between\
              \ bacterial levels using quantitative PCR (qPCR) before DSS treatment\
              \ and weight change observed at day 10. This analysis identified a positive\
              \ correlation between weight change and pre-DSS A. faecis abundance\
              \ (R = 0.3679, P = 0.0046; Fig. 3e). Similarly, a negative correlation\
              \ was observed between weight change and D. muricolitica abundance (R2\
              \ = 0.3626, P = 0.0050; Fig. 3e). This independent confirmation provides\
              \ further validation of the relationship between these species and the\
              \ severity of DSS colitis; however, additional work is needed to confirm\
              \ their roles as pathobionts.\\n\\nGlobal distribution and prevalence\
              \ in other mouse facilities\\n\\nBecause D. muricolitica and A. okayasuensis\
              \ affected the outcome of DSS colitis in our mouse facility, we next\
              \ explored the presence and distribution of these bacteria in other\
              \ mouse facilities around the world. To do so, we first generated a\
              \ global representation of laboratory mouse intestinal microbiomes by\
              \ curating 582 publicly available shotgun metagenome samples from 'control',\
              \ SPF mice. We combined this dataset with shotgun metagenomes from feces\
              \ of 40 mice at the Wellcome Sanger Institute to yield a global mouse\
              \ gut microbiome dataset covering 31 institutes across 12 countries.\
              \ We then determined the prevalence and abundance of health-associated\
              \ bacteria S. muris and A. faecis and disease-associated bacteria D.\

              \ and A. okayasuensis were both dominant members of the mouse microbiome,\

              \ 0.52 and 0.48% reads per sample, respectively. Importantly, D. muricolitica\
              \ and A. okayasuensis were each detected in 80.6% (25/31) of the institutes\
              \ included in the analyses (Fig. 4), and there were only three institutes\
              \ that did not contain either of these species. For comparison, among\
              \ health-associated species S. muris was the most dominant in the mouse\
              \ gut microbiota, present in 96.5% of samples with a mean abundance\

              \ in 5.9% of samples with a mean abundance of 0.22% reads. S. muris\
              \ was present in all (31/31) of the institutes included in the analyses,\
              \ whereas A. faecis was detected in 25.8% (8/31). The abundance of each\
              \ species also differed between institutes (Fig. 4). Thus, we show that\
              \ mouse-derived bacteria cultured from our institute are common mouse\
              \ symbionts and, importantly, D. muricolitica and A. okayasuensis are\

              n\\nDiscussion\\n\\nDespite experimental variability in the DSS mouse\
              \ model, which limits the interpretation and translation of data, the\
              \ model is increasingly used in basic research (>6,000 DSS model publications\
              \ on PubMed) and by the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries.\
              \ Cohousing, heterozygote mating and other experimental procedures have\
              \ been used in an attempt to normalize the microbiota within experiments\
              \ and ensure direct measures of the effects of mouse genetic background\
              \ on disease phenotype rather than indirect and unknown microbiota-associated\
              \ effects. In our approach we leveraged this variability in DSS outcome,\
              \ in combination with microbiome analysis, machine learning, anerobic\
              \ culturing and germ-free mouse validation experiments, to gain relevant\
              \ biological insight into microbiota determinants of DSS disease. While\
              \ this consideration of the microbiome did not completely eliminate\
              \ the impact of multidimensionality in the DSS model, we identified\
              \ and undertook experimental validation of D. muricolitica and A. okayasuensis,\
              \ both of which have a dominant effect on DSS outcome.\\n\\nInterestingly,\
              \ D. muricolitica and A. okayasuensis are phylogenetically distinct\
              \ from each other and neither had computationally predicted virulence\
              \ factors within their genome. While it remains unclear how these isolates\
              \ contribute to DSS disease, both exhibit a potential for polysaccharide\
              \ utilization that may mediate this relationship through interaction\
              \ with the mucus layer. We also noted that weight loss and intestinal\
              \ pathology do not always correlate, so they should not necessarily\
              \ be used as surrogates for each other. Similarly, substantial weight\
              \ loss was observed in monocolonized mice even in the absence of severe\
              \ inflammation, suggesting that activation of key pathways alone can\
              \ have a substantial impact on experimental outcome. Together, these\
              \ insights raise the need for further experimental study of host interactions\
              \ and the biology of these important mouse-specific bacteria.\\n\\nWe\
              \ propose that researchers should consider monitoring for D. muricolitica\
              \ and A. okayasuensis in their mouse facilities, as is undertaken for\
              \ other immunophenotyped-affecting microbes such as segmented filamentous\
              \ bacteria. In some cases, precolonization of animals with these bacteria,\
              \ if they are not present in the facility, may yield better experimental\
              \ control and increase confidence in this important and widely used\
              \ mouse model of human disease. Overall, our work suggests that the\
              \ application of metagenomics techniques to report microbiota composition,\
              \ in addition to the genetic and disease phenotypes being described,\
              \ should represent a standard minimum requirement for the DSS mouse\
              \ model. We have deposited the D. muricolitis, A. okayasuensis, S. muris\
              \ and A. faecis strains and genomes in public repositories to support\
              \ this work.\\n\\nMethods\\n\\nMouse models\\n\\nMice were maintained\
              \ under either germ-free or SPF conditions at the Wellcome Sanger Institute\
              \ Home Office-approved facility, with all procedures carried out in\
              \ accordance with the United Kingdom Animals (Scientific Procedures)\
              \ Act of 1986 under Home Office approval (PPL no. 80/2643). Germ-free\
              \ mice were maintained in positive-pressure isolators (Bell), with feces\
              \ tested by culture, microscopy and PCR to ensure sterility. Consumables\
              \ were autoclaved at 121  C for 15 min before introduction into the\
              \ isolators. For experimentation, cages were opened in a vaporized hydrogen\
              \ peroxide-sterilized, class II cabinet (Bioquell), with fecal transplant\
              \ and monocolonized gnotobiotic lines generated by weekly oral gavage\
              \ over a 3-week period. Materials were prepared in Dulbecco's PBS at\
              \ 100 mg ml-1 immediately before administration under anaerobic conditions\
              \ (10% H, 10% CO2, 80% N) in a Whitley DG250 workstation at 37  C (ref.\
              \ ). Mice were maintained in sterile ISOcages (Tecniplast) and housed\
              \ on ISOrack for the period of the experiment.\\n\\nDSS colitis challenge\\\
              n\\nDextran sulphate sodium was administered at a concentration of 1.5%\
              \ (w/v) (Affymetrix, Inc., average molecular weight 44 kDa) in drinking\
              \ water for 7 days, followed by 3 days with regular drinking water,\
              \ to C57BL6/6N mice aged 7-16 weeks (297 male, 282 female; median age\
              \ 11 weeks; s.d. 12 days). Mice were weighed every day and culled if\
              \ weight loss reached 20% of starting weight. Average weight loss curves\
              \ were censored for each group when the first member of the group reached\
              \ this endpoint, to avoid misleading calculations of the average using\
              \ the remaining members. No statistical methods were used to predetermine\
              \ sample sizes in these experiments.\\n\\nHistological assessment of\
              \ intestinal inflammation\\n\\nDextran sulphate sodium-treated SPF mice\
              \ were sacrificed at day 10 by cervical dislocation, and samples from\
              \ mid and distal colon taken. Tissue sections were fixed in buffered\
              \ 10% formalin, paraffin embedded, cut and stained with hematoxylin\
              \ and eosin (H&E). Colon histopathology was blind-graded semiquantitatively,\
              \ on a scale from zero to three, for four criteria: (1) degree of epithelial\
              \ hyperplasia/damage and goblet cell depletion; (2) leukocyte infiltration\
              \ in lamina propria; (3) area of tissue affected; and (4) presence of\
              \ markers of severe inflammation, including crypt abscesses, submucosal\
              \ inflammation and edema. Scores for individual criteria were added\
              \ for an overall inflammation score of between zero and 12 for each\
              \ sample. Scores from mid and distal colon were then averaged to obtain\
              \ inflammation scores for each mouse colon.\\n\\nMonocolonized, germ-free\
              \ mice were euthanized 7 days after DSS administration and samples taken\
              \ from the cecum and midcolon. Tissue sections were fixed in methacarn,\
              \ paraffin embedded, sectioned and stained with H&E. Colon and cecum\
              \ histopathology was graded on a semiquantitative scale by a pathologist\
              \ blinded to the groups. The criteria scored were (1) degree of epithelial\
              \ hyperplasia/damage and goblet cell depletion; (2) severity of leukocyte\
              \ infiltration in lamina propria; (3) extent of inflammation; and (4)\
              \ presence of markers of severe inflammation, including crypt abscesses,\
              \ submucosal inflammation and edema. Each criterion was scored on a\
              \ scale of zero to three based on previously described thresholds and\
              \ the sum of the individual scores was recorded as an indication of\
              \ overall inflammation. For all animal experiments, treatments were\
              \ randomized by cage by researchers blinded to treatment conditions.\
              \ For statistical analysis, distribution was assumed to be normal but\
              \ this was not formally tested\\n\\nBacterial culture\\n\\nFecal samples\
              \ and bacterial isolates were cultured for anaerobic gastrointestinal\
              \ bacteria under anaerobic conditions (10% H, 10% CO2, 80% N) in a Whitley\
              \ DG250 workstation at 37  C (ref. ). Fecal samples were homogenized\
              \ in reduced PBS (0.1 g ml-1 PBS), serially diluted and plated directly\
              \ onto YCFA agar supplemented with 0.002 g ml-1 each of glucose, maltose\
              \ and cellobiose. Colonies were picked, restreaked to purity and identified\
              \ using 16 S rRNA gene sequencing.\\n\\nMicrobiota profiling and analysis\\\
              n\\nFecal samples were collected directly from mice and immediately\
              \ stored at -80  C until DNA extraction. DNA was extracted from samples\
              \ using the FastDNA Spin Kit for Soil (MPBio) and stored at -20  C until\
              \ metagenomic sequencing. DNA samples were quantified using a Qubit\
              \ 4 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher). 16 S rRNA amplicon-based profiling\
              \ was performed using the FastDNA Spin Kit for Soil (MP Biomedicals)\
              \ on 300 mg of fecal sample from each mouse. The V1-V2 region of 16\
              \ S rRNA genes was amplified with a Q5 High-Fidelity Polymerase Kit\
              \ (New England Biolabs): F': AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACAC-TATGGTAATT-CC-AGMGTTYGATYMTGGCTCAG;\
              \ R': CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGATACGAGACTGATTAGTCAGTCAGAAGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAG.\
              \ Each PCR amplification was performed as four independent amplifications\
              \ and pooled in equimolar amounts for 150-base-paired (bp)-end sequencing\
              \ with the Illumina MiSeq platform. For shotgun metagenomic sequencing,\
              \ samples with >100 ng of DNA material were processed onward to paired-end\
              \ (2 x 150 bp) metagenomics sequencing on the HiSeq 4000 platform as\
              \ per standard manufacturer library preparation and sequencing protocols.\\\
              n\\nMetagenomic data analysis\\n\\nAnalysis of 16 S rRNA amplicon sequences\
              \ was performed with mothur MiSeq SOP v.1.42.3 using SILVA v.132 (ref.\
              \ ). The 16 S rRNA gene alignments were used to determine maximum likelihood\
              \ phylogeny using FastTree v.2.1.10 (ref. ). Phylogenetic trees were\
              \ visualized and edited using iTOL. Shotgun metagenomic reads were filtered\
              \ for quality and adapter sequences using KneadData v.0.7.3, with default\
              \ settings. Host reads were removed from samples using the GRCm39 reference\
              \ genome and Bowtie2 v.2.3.5. In addition, reads were aligned to the\
              \ Phi X 174 genome and removed. Taxonomic classification of metagenomic\
              \ reads was performed using Kraken2 v.2.0.8 and a custom database built\
              \ from the genomes of the Mouse Gut Bacterial Catalog (MGBC).\\n\\nAll\
              \ data analyses were performed in R v.4.0.2. Species abundant at >=0.01%\
              \ reads were considered present in a sample, and operational taxonomic\
              \ units (OTUs) were considered statistically different at P < 0.05.\
              \ For shotgun metagenomic sequencing, relative abundance of species\
              \ was corrected using Bracken v.2.5.2. Bar plots for species prevalence\
              \ data and sample numbers were generated using the ggplot2 v.3.3.3 package.\
              \ To quantify and visualize intrainstitute abundance, species abundance\
              \ data for each sample underwent Bayesian multiplicative replacement\
              \ of zero counts using the zCompositions v.1.3.4 package, and the data\
              \ transformed using center log-ratio normalization. Mean abundance per\
              \ sample was then calculated and visualized using the pheatmap v.1.0.12\
              \ package. Principal component analyses were performed in R, and linear\
              \ regression analysis was performed using the linear regression function\
              \ in python scikit-learn v.0.20.4. Alpha diversity was assessed using\
              \ Vegan v.2.5.6 (ref. ). Correlation analysis was performed using Spearman's\
              \ rank correlation coefficient.\\n\\nCuration of public metagenome samples\\\
              n\\nTo assess the abundance of both health- and disease-associated bacteria\
              \ in mice from different institutes, we curated publicly available fecal\
              \ shotgun metagenomes for healthy, control SPF mice from NCBI and ENA.\
              \ These samples included mice from different genetic backgrounds and\
              \ strains, but samples were excluded if mice were younger than 3 weeks,\
              \ had received antimicrobial treatment or dietary intervention or had\

              \ Primers were designed using the taxon-linked gene catalog of MGBC.\
              \ Briefly, we identified gene targets that were both unique to, and\
              \ highly conserved in, the genome of each species. To ensure target\
              \ specificity, we selected gene clusters that shared <50% sequence identity\
              \ with all nontarget species sequences. Gene targets were defined as\
              \ highly conserved if they were identified in 100% of high-quality target\
              \ species genomes in the MGBC. Furthermore, only single-copy-number\
              \ gene targets were considered. Sequences for selected gene products\
              \ were then clustered at 90% sequence identity and used as templates\
              \ for design of PCR primers with NCBI Primer-BLAST, ensuring specificity\
              \ against the NCBI nonredundant gene catalog. Two primers for each species\

              \ sp. nov\\n\\nAlistipes okayasuensis (o'ka.ya.su.en.sis. N.L. masc./fem.\
              \ adj. okayasuensis) is named after Isao Okayasu, who first described\
              \ DSS colitis as a model for ulcerative colitis in mice. Phylogenomic\
              \ analyses place strain A61T in the Alistipes cluster. The digital DNA-DNA\
              \ hybridization (dDDH) value between A. onderdonkii and A. putredinis\
              \ is 24.4%, while dDDH values between strain A61T, A. onderdonkii and\
              \ A. putredinis are 25.2 and 21.4%, respectively. The G + C content\
              \ difference between the genome of strain A61T and A. onderdonkii, its\
              \ closest phylogenomic neighbor, is 1.39%, while their 16S rRNA gene\
              \ sequence identity is 96.03%. These analyses strongly indicate that\
              \ 'Alistipes okayasuensis' is a separate species within the genus Alistipes.\\\
              n\\nThis strain is a strict anaerobe. Carbon source utilization analysis\
              \ was combined with reconstruction of Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and\
              \ Genomes (KEGG) metabolic pathways (55.58% of 2,022 predicted open\
              \ reading frames (ORFs) could be annotated) to functionally characterize\
              \ the strain. The strain encodes 47 genes predicted to be carbohydrate-active\
              \ enzymes (CAZymes), including 29 glycoside hydrolases: seven beta-glucosidases\
              \ (GH3, EC 3.2.1.21); five beta-galactosidases (EC 3.2.1.23); five endohydrolytic\
              \ alpha-glucosidases (GH13), including four alpha-amylases (EC 3.2.1.1);\
              \ three exohydrolytic alpha-glucosidases (GH31, EC 3.2.1.20); three\
              \ cellulases (EC 3.2.1.4); three mannan endo-1,4-beta-mannosidases (EC\
              \ 3.2.1.78); and an alpha-l-fucosidase (EC 3.2.1.51). Despite this predicted\
              \ hydrolytic potential, the strain shows limited capacity to utilize\
              \ disaccharides and oligosaccharides as sole carbon sources. While the\

        \ mouse models are central to basic biomedical research and serve as important\
        \ preclinical models in drug discovery for a variety of human diseases, including\
        \ autoimmune and metabolic disorders, cancers and infections. Unfortunately,\
        \ there is tremendous variability in disease penetrance and reproducibility\
        \ among genetically identical mice within and between mouse facilities, limiting\
        \ the utility of many commonly used models. Specific-pathogen-free (SPF) protocols\
        \ have been successfully employed to control the confounding effects that\
        \ can be caused by known bacterial pathogens, but we lack equivalent knowledge\
        \ of the effects of the diverse, uncharacterized symbiotic bacteria within\
        \ the indigenous gut microbiota of mice. While our knowledge of the human\
        \ gut microbiota in health and disease has expanded extensively with large-scale\
        \ microbiome studies, comprehensive computational bacterial discovery and\
        \ extensive genome-sequenced bacterial collections, equivalent investigations\
        \ in mouse models have remained limited. The vast differences in species type,\
        \ composition and dispersal between human and mouse microbiotas highlight\
        \ the importance of efforts to culture mouse-specific bacteria and to validate\
        \ their functions during intestinal homeostasis and disease.\\n\\nInflammatory\
        \ bowel disease (IBD) research relies heavily on laboratory mice to understand\
        \ colitis and the role of host genetics in disease resistance and susceptibility.\
        \ Detailed immune characterization shows colitis induction with specific microbial\
        \ communities or species colonization with Helicobacter spp., Enterobacteriaceae,\
        \ Bilophila wadsworthia or segmented filamentous bacteria. Potential genetic\
        \ modulators of IBD are routinely assessed through administration of dextran\
        \ sulphate sodium (DSS) at various concentrations in drinking water, which\
        \ acts by damaging the gut epithelial barrier to trigger inflammatory disease.\
        \ In germ-free mice, immune-mediated colitis is largely absent although reduced\
        \ barrier function can introduce susceptibility at higher DSS concentrations.\
        \ Similarly, dietary changes in both germ-free and SPF mice can determine\
        \ DSS susceptibility in a microbiome-dependent and -independent manner, and\
        \ highly specific protection is provided by the presence of Clostridium immunis.\
        \ Despite these advances, the gut microbiota in these mouse models, including\
        \ standard SPF models, is rarely profiled at the genomic level or cultured\
        \ in the laboratory, nor robustly controlled to understand the contribution\
        \ of general gut bacteria to experimental outcomes.\\n\\nTo quantify the variability\
        \ of the widely used DSS model of IBD and to investigate primary factors contributing\
        \ to this variability, we undertook a large-scale experiment using 579 genetically\
        \ identical laboratory mice in a single animal facility. Incorporating standardized\
        \ phenotyping, microbiome analysis and metadata collection, this approach\
        \ was designed to identify and validate the causes of variability for standard\
        \ experimental endpoints (weight loss and intestinal pathology). Using a data-driven\
        \ approach we identified, from gut microbiome data, candidate bacterial taxa\
        \ driving weight loss and intestinal inflammation. Functional validation with\
        \ cultured isolates suggests that these specific bacterial strains can determine\
        \ experimental outcomes in gnotobiotic mice. Thus, using an experimental approach\
        \ for microbiome discovery, we identified the previously undescribed mouse\
        \ gut bacteria Duncaniella muricolitica and Alistipes okayasuensis, found\
        \ frequently in mouse colonies around the world, that impact outcomes in the\
        \ DSS model of colitis and may be acting as pathobionts.\\n\\nResults\\n\\\

        \ in experimental endpoints in these genetically identical mice at 10 days\
        \ post DSS treatment, with histological assessment of intestinal pathology\

        n\\nSource data\\n\\nSince all mice were derived from the same genetic founder\
        \ stock, the most likely mediator of their DSS phenotype was an extrinsic\
        \ lineage-specific factor. However, to exclude the role of host genetics or\
        \ epigenetic differences between colonies, and to determine whether the microbiota\
        \ alone could be responsible for the observed phenotypic variation, fecal\
        \ samples were collected from SPF mice (without DSS treatment) from parental\
        \ lineages that represented extremes of disease outcome and were used to colonize\
        \ C57BL/6N germ-free mice. These colonized recipient mice were then subjected\
        \ to DSS treatment involving daily weight measurements, with colon sections\
        \ collected and analyzed histologically 10 days after the initiation of DSS\
        \ treatment. Recipient mice exhibited both weight loss and pathology scores\
        \ not statistically different from those observed in the respective donor\
        \ mouse lineages, but differing significantly between disease- and non-associated\
        \ lineages (P = 0.0002, paired t-test; Fig. 2a). From these results it is\
        \ clear that, independent of other factors such as host genetics or epigenetic\
        \ lineage-specific factors, the microbiota is sufficient to produce the observed\
        \ variation in phenotypic response to DSS administration.\\n\\nDiscovery of\
        \ bacteria that drive disease variability\\n\\nHaving established the importance\
        \ of the microbiota in mediation of phenotypic outcomes to DSS in genetically\
        \ identical mice, we next sought to understand the degree of variability in\
        \ the mouse microbiota across a single facility, and to define changes in\
        \ the microbiota that occur with DSS treatment. Fecal samples were collected\
        \ before DSS treatment and 10 days after DSS exposure, and subjected to taxonomic\
        \ profiling with 16 S ribosomal RNA amplicon sequencing to determine microbiota\
        \ community composition. Consistent with previous reports of gastrointestinal\
        \ inflammation, this analysis demonstrated a clear separation of microbiome\
        \ community between pre- and post-DSS samples (Fig. 2b,c and Extended Data\
        \ Figs. 2 and 3) and a significant reduction in bacterial diversity (Shannon\
        \ diversity index, P = 0.0357; Fig. 2d). Although expansion of Proteobacteria\
        \ is often associated with gut microbiome dysbiosis, while an increase in\
        \ Proteobacteria was observed post DSS (P < 0.05, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test),\
        \ limited association was observed between weight loss and Proteobacteria\
        \ proportion either pre (Fig. 2e; Spearman correlation, 0.196) or post DSS\
        \ treatment (Fig. 2e; Spearman correlation, -0.289). This suggests that other\
        \ gut bacteria may be contributing to the observed variation in DSS resistance\
        \ and susceptibility.\\n\\nGiven the transmissibility of disease phenotype\
        \ we observed in the germ-free mouse experiments, we reasoned that the observed\
        \ phenotypic variation was primarily dependent on baseline microbiota composition\
        \ before DSS treatment. To understand the composition of microbiota associated\
        \ with increased risk of disease outcome, we applied linear discriminant analysis\
        \ to gut microbiota composition before and after DSS exposure. This unsupervised\
        \ analysis leveraged the variability between mouse lineage-specific bacteria\
        \ to identify the bacterial taxa that most closely predict DSS response. Using\
        \ this approach, we identified two statistically different bacterial taxa\
        \ associated with no disease, and five statistically different bacterial taxa\
        \ associated with >5% weight loss. Notably, no relationship was observed between\
        \ the occurrence or abundance of these isolates in mice before DSS exposure,\
        \ and equivalent predictive bacterial taxa were not identified within the\
        \ microbiota of mice after DSS exposure. Our results suggest that the presence\
        \ of specific gut bacterial taxa before DSS exposure may influence disease\
        \ severity and outcome, possibly by either priming or protection from disease.\\\
        n\\nIsolation of bacterial species for functional validation\\n\\nWhile we\
        \ show clear associations between specific bacterial taxa and DSS-mediated\
        \ disease outcome using 16 S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing, accurate taxonomic\
        \ identification to strain level and experimental validation require the isolation\
        \ and genome sequencing of pure clonal cultures of bacterial strains. To target\
        \ and purify bacterial strains, we next performed broad-based culture of ~2,000\
        \ bacterial colonies from mouse fecal samples. The resulting isolates were\
        \ identified by capillary 16 S rRNA gene sequencing and included four previously\
        \ identified bacterial taxa, two 'disease associated' and two 'health associated'.\
        \ These isolates were subjected to whole-genome sequencing and genomic analysis\
        \ to aid in precise taxonomic and phylogenetic assignment (Extended Data Fig.\
        \ 4). In addition, we performed extensive phenotypic characterization and\
        \ comparative genome analyses of these four species (Methods) as a basis to\
        \ provisionally name the health-associated bacteria Anaerostipes faecis and\
        \ Sangeribacter muris and the disease-associated bacteria Duncaniella muricolitica\
        \ and Alistipes okayasuensis; of note, the last three species are mouse specific.\

        n\\nWe next repeated the DSS experimental model in either germ-free mice or\
        \ germ-free mice stably monocolonized for 4 weeks with one of these four bacterial\
        \ strains (Extended Data Figs. 5a and 6). Control germ-free mice treated with\
        \ DSS neither lost weight (Fig. 3a) nor experienced mortality (Fig. 3b) over\
        \ the course of the experiment, suggesting that the presence of gut bacteria\
        \ is important in triggering overt disease in our facility. Comparable experimental\
        \ outcomes were observed in DSS-treated, germ-free mice monocolonized with\
        \ either of the health-associated bacteria, which did not lose weight or develop\
        \ intestinal pathology (Fig. 3a) nor experienced significant mortality (Fig.\
        \ 3b). In contrast, when DSS-treated mice were monocolonized with either of\
        \ the disease-associated bacteria, we observed more rapid and greater weight\
        \ loss (Fig. 3a) and significantly reduced survival (Fig. 3b). Therefore,\
        \ we identified and validated D. muricolitica and A. okayasuensis as mouse\
        \ bacteria that can promote disease not observed in mice monocolonized with\
        \ the commensal bacteria S. muris and A. faecis.\\n\\nTo understand inflammatory\
        \ immune responses in the intestine potentially caused by disease-associated\
        \ versus health-associated species, we next examined histology, immune cell\
        \ populations and cytokine production. The human-colonizing A. faecis and\
        \ the facility-prevalent D. muricolitica were chosen as exemplary disease-\
        \ and health-associated bacteria, respectively, for these analyses. Flow cytometric\
        \ analysis of intestinal lamina propria leukocytes isolated from germ-free\
        \ mice monocolonized for 4 weeks with either A. faecis or D. muricolitica\
        \ revealed that colonization with either strain did not significantly impact\
        \ the composition of intestinal leukocyte and lymphocyte subsets (Extended\
        \ Data Figs. 5b,c and 6). However, the perturbation and epithelial disruption\
        \ induced by DSS led to significantly increased inflammatory CD64+CD11c+ monocytes/macrophages\
        \ in the lamina propria compartment of the large intestine in D. muricolitica\
        \ monocolonized mice, but not in A. faecis monocolonized mice (Extended Data\
        \ Figs. 5c,d and 6). These monocytes have been shown to play a pathogenic\
        \ role in the intestine in the context of Helicobacter-induced inflammation.\
        \ This suggests that, although neither pathogenic nor immunogenic at homeostasis,\
        \ D. muricolitica drives increased inflammatory responses in the wake of epithelial\
        \ damage whereas health-associated A. faecis does not. Importantly, while\
        \ histological samples taken after 7 days of DSS treatment from colons and\
        \ caeca of D. muricolitica monocolonized mice occasionally exhibited features\
        \ of severe inflammation, this was not statistically different from that of\
        \ A. faecis monocolonized mice (Fig. 3c,d) and did not consistently correspond\
        \ to the weight loss observed. This again suggests that weight loss in the\
        \ DSS model may not always correlate with intestinal inflammation and pathology.\\\
        n\\nTo determine whether the presence of D. muricolitica or A. faecis had\
        \ a positive or negative correlation with weight change, we next examined\
        \ 20 independent mice and assessed the relationship between bacterial levels\
        \ using quantitative PCR (qPCR) before DSS treatment and weight change observed\
        \ at day 10. This analysis identified a positive correlation between weight\
        \ change and pre-DSS A. faecis abundance (R = 0.3679, P = 0.0046; Fig. 3e).\
        \ Similarly, a negative correlation was observed between weight change and\
        \ D. muricolitica abundance (R2 = 0.3626, P = 0.0050; Fig. 3e). This independent\
        \ confirmation provides further validation of the relationship between these\
        \ species and the severity of DSS colitis; however, additional work is needed\
        \ to confirm their roles as pathobionts.\\n\\nGlobal distribution and prevalence\
        \ in other mouse facilities\\n\\nBecause D. muricolitica and A. okayasuensis\
        \ affected the outcome of DSS colitis in our mouse facility, we next explored\
        \ the presence and distribution of these bacteria in other mouse facilities\
        \ around the world. To do so, we first generated a global representation of\
        \ laboratory mouse intestinal microbiomes by curating 582 publicly available\
        \ shotgun metagenome samples from 'control', SPF mice. We combined this dataset\
        \ with shotgun metagenomes from feces of 40 mice at the Wellcome Sanger Institute\
        \ to yield a global mouse gut microbiome dataset covering 31 institutes across\
        \ 12 countries. We then determined the prevalence and abundance of health-associated\
        \ bacteria S. muris and A. faecis and disease-associated bacteria D. muricolitica\
        \ and A. okayasuensis in this mouse microbiome dataset.\\n\\nGlobal epidemiology\

        n\\nDuncaniella muricolitica and A. okayasuensis were both dominant members\
        \ of the mouse microbiome, present in 54.5 and 47.9% of samples and with a\
        \ mean abundance of 0.52 and 0.48% reads per sample, respectively. Importantly,\
        \ D. muricolitica and A. okayasuensis were each detected in 80.6% (25/31)\
        \ of the institutes included in the analyses (Fig. 4), and there were only\
        \ three institutes that did not contain either of these species. For comparison,\

        \ gut microbiota, present in 96.5% of samples with a mean abundance of 6.2%\
        \ reads, while A. faecis was a relatively minor species, present in 5.9% of\
        \ samples with a mean abundance of 0.22% reads. S. muris was present in all\
        \ (31/31) of the institutes included in the analyses, whereas A. faecis was\
        \ detected in 25.8% (8/31). The abundance of each species also differed between\
        \ institutes (Fig. 4). Thus, we show that mouse-derived bacteria cultured\
        \ from our institute are common mouse symbionts and, importantly, D. muricolitica\
        \ and A. okayasuensis are common, but not ubiquitous, in animal facilities\
        \ around the world.\\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\nDespite experimental variability\
        \ in the DSS mouse model, which limits the interpretation and translation\
        \ of data, the model is increasingly used in basic research (>6,000 DSS model\

        \ we leveraged this variability in DSS outcome, in combination with microbiome\
        \ analysis, machine learning, anerobic culturing and germ-free mouse validation\
        \ experiments, to gain relevant biological insight into microbiota determinants\
        \ of DSS disease. While this consideration of the microbiome did not completely\
        \ eliminate the impact of multidimensionality in the DSS model, we identified\
        \ and undertook experimental validation of D. muricolitica and A. okayasuensis,\
        \ both of which have a dominant effect on DSS outcome.\\n\\nInterestingly,\
        \ D. muricolitica and A. okayasuensis are phylogenetically distinct from each\
        \ other and neither had computationally predicted virulence factors within\
        \ their genome. While it remains unclear how these isolates contribute to\
        \ DSS disease, both exhibit a potential for polysaccharide utilization that\
        \ may mediate this relationship through interaction with the mucus layer.\
        \ We also noted that weight loss and intestinal pathology do not always correlate,\
        \ so they should not necessarily be used as surrogates for each other. Similarly,\
        \ substantial weight loss was observed in monocolonized mice even in the absence\
        \ of severe inflammation, suggesting that activation of key pathways alone\
        \ can have a substantial impact on experimental outcome. Together, these insights\
        \ raise the need for further experimental study of host interactions and the\
        \ biology of these important mouse-specific bacteria.\\n\\nWe propose that\
        \ researchers should consider monitoring for D. muricolitica and A. okayasuensis\
        \ in their mouse facilities, as is undertaken for other immunophenotyped-affecting\
        \ microbes such as segmented filamentous bacteria. In some cases, precolonization\
        \ of animals with these bacteria, if they are not present in the facility,\
        \ may yield better experimental control and increase confidence in this important\
        \ and widely used mouse model of human disease. Overall, our work suggests\
        \ that the application of metagenomics techniques to report microbiota composition,\
        \ in addition to the genetic and disease phenotypes being described, should\
        \ represent a standard minimum requirement for the DSS mouse model. We have\
        \ deposited the D. muricolitis, A. okayasuensis, S. muris and A. faecis strains\
        \ and genomes in public repositories to support this work.\\n\\nMethods\\\
        n\\nMouse models\\n\\nMice were maintained under either germ-free or SPF conditions\
        \ at the Wellcome Sanger Institute Home Office-approved facility, with all\
        \ procedures carried out in accordance with the United Kingdom Animals (Scientific\
        \ Procedures) Act of 1986 under Home Office approval (PPL no. 80/2643). Germ-free\
        \ mice were maintained in positive-pressure isolators (Bell), with feces tested\
        \ by culture, microscopy and PCR to ensure sterility. Consumables were autoclaved\
        \ at 121  C for 15 min before introduction into the isolators. For experimentation,\
        \ cages were opened in a vaporized hydrogen peroxide-sterilized, class II\
        \ cabinet (Bioquell), with fecal transplant and monocolonized gnotobiotic\
        \ lines generated by weekly oral gavage over a 3-week period. Materials were\
        \ prepared in Dulbecco's PBS at 100 mg ml-1 immediately before administration\
        \ under anaerobic conditions (10% H, 10% CO2, 80% N) in a Whitley DG250 workstation\
        \ at 37  C (ref. ). Mice were maintained in sterile ISOcages (Tecniplast)\
        \ and housed on ISOrack for the period of the experiment.\\n\\nDSS colitis\
        \ challenge\\n\\nDextran sulphate sodium was administered at a concentration\
        \ of 1.5% (w/v) (Affymetrix, Inc., average molecular weight 44 kDa) in drinking\
        \ water for 7 days, followed by 3 days with regular drinking water, to C57BL6/6N\
        \ mice aged 7-16 weeks (297 male, 282 female; median age 11 weeks; s.d. 12\
        \ days). Mice were weighed every day and culled if weight loss reached 20%\
        \ of starting weight. Average weight loss curves were censored for each group\
        \ when the first member of the group reached this endpoint, to avoid misleading\
        \ calculations of the average using the remaining members. No statistical\
        \ methods were used to predetermine sample sizes in these experiments.\\n\\\
        nHistological assessment of intestinal inflammation\\n\\nDextran sulphate\
        \ sodium-treated SPF mice were sacrificed at day 10 by cervical dislocation,\
        \ and samples from mid and distal colon taken. Tissue sections were fixed\
        \ in buffered 10% formalin, paraffin embedded, cut and stained with hematoxylin\
        \ and eosin (H&E). Colon histopathology was blind-graded semiquantitatively,\
        \ on a scale from zero to three, for four criteria: (1) degree of epithelial\
        \ hyperplasia/damage and goblet cell depletion; (2) leukocyte infiltration\
        \ in lamina propria; (3) area of tissue affected; and (4) presence of markers\
        \ of severe inflammation, including crypt abscesses, submucosal inflammation\
        \ and edema. Scores for individual criteria were added for an overall inflammation\
        \ score of between zero and 12 for each sample. Scores from mid and distal\
        \ colon were then averaged to obtain inflammation scores for each mouse colon.\\\
        n\\nMonocolonized, germ-free mice were euthanized 7 days after DSS administration\
        \ and samples taken from the cecum and midcolon. Tissue sections were fixed\
        \ in methacarn, paraffin embedded, sectioned and stained with H&E. Colon and\
        \ cecum histopathology was graded on a semiquantitative scale by a pathologist\
        \ blinded to the groups. The criteria scored were (1) degree of epithelial\
        \ hyperplasia/damage and goblet cell depletion; (2) severity of leukocyte\
        \ infiltration in lamina propria; (3) extent of inflammation; and (4) presence\
        \ of markers of severe inflammation, including crypt abscesses, submucosal\
        \ inflammation and edema. Each criterion was scored on a scale of zero to\
        \ three based on previously described thresholds and the sum of the individual\
        \ scores was recorded as an indication of overall inflammation. For all animal\
        \ experiments, treatments were randomized by cage by researchers blinded to\
        \ treatment conditions. For statistical analysis, distribution was assumed\
        \ to be normal but this was not formally tested\\n\\nBacterial culture\\n\\\
        nFecal samples and bacterial isolates were cultured for anaerobic gastrointestinal\
        \ bacteria under anaerobic conditions (10% H, 10% CO2, 80% N) in a Whitley\
        \ DG250 workstation at 37  C (ref. ). Fecal samples were homogenized in reduced\
        \ PBS (0.1 g ml-1 PBS), serially diluted and plated directly onto YCFA agar\
        \ supplemented with 0.002 g ml-1 each of glucose, maltose and cellobiose.\
        \ Colonies were picked, restreaked to purity and identified using 16 S rRNA\
        \ gene sequencing.\\n\\nMicrobiota profiling and analysis\\n\\nFecal samples\
        \ were collected directly from mice and immediately stored at -80  C until\
        \ DNA extraction. DNA was extracted from samples using the FastDNA Spin Kit\
        \ for Soil (MPBio) and stored at -20  C until metagenomic sequencing. DNA\
        \ samples were quantified using a Qubit 4 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher). 16\
        \ S rRNA amplicon-based profiling was performed using the FastDNA Spin Kit\
        \ for Soil (MP Biomedicals) on 300 mg of fecal sample from each mouse. The\
        \ V1-V2 region of 16 S rRNA genes was amplified with a Q5 High-Fidelity Polymerase\
        \ Kit (New England Biolabs): F': AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACAC-TATGGTAATT-CC-AGMGTTYGATYMTGGCTCAG;\
        \ R': CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGATACGAGACTGATTAGTCAGTCAGAAGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAG. Each\
        \ PCR amplification was performed as four independent amplifications and pooled\
        \ in equimolar amounts for 150-base-paired (bp)-end sequencing with the Illumina\
        \ MiSeq platform. For shotgun metagenomic sequencing, samples with >100 ng\
        \ of DNA material were processed onward to paired-end (2 x 150 bp) metagenomics\
        \ sequencing on the HiSeq 4000 platform as per standard manufacturer library\
        \ preparation and sequencing protocols.\\n\\nMetagenomic data analysis\\n\\\
        nAnalysis of 16 S rRNA amplicon sequences was performed with mothur MiSeq\
        \ SOP v.1.42.3 using SILVA v.132 (ref. ). The 16 S rRNA gene alignments were\
        \ used to determine maximum likelihood phylogeny using FastTree v.2.1.10 (ref.\
        \ ). Phylogenetic trees were visualized and edited using iTOL. Shotgun metagenomic\
        \ reads were filtered for quality and adapter sequences using KneadData v.0.7.3,\
        \ with default settings. Host reads were removed from samples using the GRCm39\
        \ reference genome and Bowtie2 v.2.3.5. In addition, reads were aligned to\
        \ the Phi X 174 genome and removed. Taxonomic classification of metagenomic\
        \ reads was performed using Kraken2 v.2.0.8 and a custom database built from\
        \ the genomes of the Mouse Gut Bacterial Catalog (MGBC).\\n\\nAll data analyses\
        \ were performed in R v.4.0.2. Species abundant at >=0.01% reads were considered\
        \ present in a sample, and operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were considered\
        \ statistically different at P < 0.05. For shotgun metagenomic sequencing,\
        \ relative abundance of species was corrected using Bracken v.2.5.2. Bar plots\
        \ for species prevalence data and sample numbers were generated using the\
        \ ggplot2 v.3.3.3 package. To quantify and visualize intrainstitute abundance,\
        \ species abundance data for each sample underwent Bayesian multiplicative\
        \ replacement of zero counts using the zCompositions v.1.3.4 package, and\
        \ the data transformed using center log-ratio normalization. Mean abundance\
        \ per sample was then calculated and visualized using the pheatmap v.1.0.12\
        \ package. Principal component analyses were performed in R, and linear regression\
        \ analysis was performed using the linear regression function in python scikit-learn\
        \ v.0.20.4. Alpha diversity was assessed using Vegan v.2.5.6 (ref. ). Correlation\
        \ analysis was performed using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient.\\\
        n\\nCuration of public metagenome samples\\n\\nTo assess the abundance of\
        \ both health- and disease-associated bacteria in mice from different institutes,\
        \ we curated publicly available fecal shotgun metagenomes for healthy, control\
        \ SPF mice from NCBI and ENA. These samples included mice from different genetic\
        \ backgrounds and strains, but samples were excluded if mice were younger\
        \ than 3 weeks, had received antimicrobial treatment or dietary intervention\
        \ or had gene knockout. In total 582 fecal shotgun metagenomes were curated.\\\
        n\\nqPCR of bacterial load\\n\\nAnaerostipes faecis and D. muricolitica were\
        \ quantified in the feces of SPF mice using qPCR with custom primers. Primers\
        \ were designed using the taxon-linked gene catalog of MGBC. Briefly, we identified\
        \ gene targets that were both unique to, and highly conserved in, the genome\
        \ of each species. To ensure target specificity, we selected gene clusters\
        \ that shared <50% sequence identity with all nontarget species sequences.\
        \ Gene targets were defined as highly conserved if they were identified in\
        \ 100% of high-quality target species genomes in the MGBC. Furthermore, only\
        \ single-copy-number gene targets were considered. Sequences for selected\
        \ gene products were then clustered at 90% sequence identity and used as templates\
        \ for design of PCR primers with NCBI Primer-BLAST, ensuring specificity against\
        \ the NCBI nonredundant gene catalog. Two primers for each species were used\
        \ in conjunction for qPCR.\\n\\nPrimers: A14_1 (gene target: MGBC000029_00009),\
        \ forward 5'-AGCTGTTCAGGTGTCTGATCTT-3', reverse 5'-CGGTCCACTTCGCAGTATCA-3',\

        \ reverse 5'-CTGCGTGTCCACAGAAGAGT-3', product size 70 bp; A60_1 (gene target:\
        \ MGBC109741_00862), forward 5'-CCATCTTTTCGGACGGTGGA-3', reverse 5'-CGAGGTCTCCCTGAAACGAC-3',\
        \ product size 125 bp; A60_2 (gene target: MGBC140600_00802), forward 5'-\
        \ AAAACGGTGACAGCTCGGAA-3', reverse 5'- GTCTCTTTTTGGCGGATGGG-3', product size\
        \ 93 bp.\\n\\nDNA was extracted from feces using FastDNA Spin Kit for Soil\
        \ (MPBio) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and DNA eluted into\
        \ 100 microl of double-distilled H2O. Eluted DNA was then diluted 1:50 and\
        \ qPCR performed using SYBR Green chemistry (Thermo Fisher). To approximate\
        \ the relative abundance of target species in SPF feces, cycle threshold values\
        \ were normalized to those of a universal bacterial 16 S primer (F: 5'- GTGSTGCAYGGYTGTCGTCA-3';\
        \ R: 5'- ACGTCRTCCMCACCTTCCTC-3').\\n\\nIntestinal immune cell isolation\\\
        n\\nLarge intestines were excised and separated from mesentery and fat. Transluminal\
        \ sections were taken from the cecum and distal colon for histology. The intestines\
        \ were opened longitudinally, cleared of feces then washed three times in\
        \ cold PBS. To isolate intraepithelial immune populations, the large intestines\
        \ were cut into 1-cm pieces, washed in cold PBS then incubated in 10 ml of\
        \ PBS + 1 mM dithiothreitol for 10 min. Tissues were manually disrupted via\
        \ shaking and then strained, with supernatant then collected. Tissues were\
        \ incubated in 10 ml of PBS + 30 mM EDTA + 10 ml of HEPES at 37  C and 200\
        \ r.p.m., before being shaken and strained. The supernatants from these two\
        \ steps were pooled, filtered at 70 microm and the filtrate fractionated using\
        \ a discontinuous Percoll gradient (80/40%). Epithelial cells were isolated\
        \ from the surface of the Percoll, and intraepithelial immune cells isolated\
        \ from the interface.\\n\\nTo access the lamina propria compartment, tissues\
        \ were manually chopped and digested in HBSS + 25 mM HEPES + 1 mM sodium pyruvate\
        \ containing 0.05 mg ml-1 Collagenase VIII (Sigma) and 50 microg ml-1 DNase\
        \ I (Sigma) for 1 h at 37  C and 80 r.p.m. Samples were mechanically disrupted\
        \ and filtered at 70 microm. The filtrate was fractionated using a discontinuous\
        \ Percoll gradient (80/40%). Lamina propria immune cells were isolated from\
        \ the interface.\\n\\nFlow cytometry\\n\\nIntestinal and mesenteric lymph\
        \ node immune cell populations were characterized by flow cytometry. For intracellular\
        \ cytokine staining, cells were incubated in T cell medium (RPMI, 10% FBS,\
        \ 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 2 mM GLUTamax, 1x nonessential amino acids, 0.1 mM\
        \ 2-beta-mercaptoethanol, 10 mM HEPES, 1% penicillin/streptomycin) + 1x Cell\
        \ Stimulation Cocktail with Protein Inhibitors (eBioscience) for 3 h at 37\
        \  C before staining. Nonviable cells were stained using Live/Dead Fixable\
        \ Aqua. Cells were permeabilized with CytoFix/CytoPerm (BD), followed by intracellular\
        \ staining in PermBuffer (eBioscience).\\n\\nAll antibodies were purchased\
        \ from eBioscience unless otherwise indicated. Antibodies used were CD45-SB600,\
        \ TCRb-APC-Cy7, MHCII-FITC, CD4-PE-Cy7, CD8a-AF700, CD8b-PE, IFNg-PerCP-Cy5.5,\

        \ (BD) and F4/80-e450. Sample data were acquired with an Attune NxT flow cytometer\
        \ coupled with an Attune CytKick Max autosampler. Data were analyzed using\
        \ FlowJo v.10. Antibody details and concentrations are included in Supplementary\
        \ Table 1.\\n\\nBacterial species characterization\\n\\nWhile genomes are\
        \ publicly available for the species described in this paper, and are represented\
        \ by genomic species clusters in the Genome Taxonomy Database: A14 = Anaerostipes\
        \ sp000508985 (GCF_000508985.1: 98.76% ANI), A43 = CAG-485 sp002362485 (GCF_003833075.1:\
        \ 98.66% ANI), A60 = Duncaniella sp001689575 (GCF_003762875.1: 96.19% ANI),\
        \ A61 = Alistipes sp002362235 (GCA_002362235.1: 98.54% ANI)). These species\
        \ have not yet been characterized, nor have these names been validly published\
        \ according to the International Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes. Because\
        \ these species are uncharacterized, they are referred to as previously undescribed\
        \ in this manuscript. Phenotypic data for the capacity of each species to\
        \ utilize 95 substrates as sole carbon sources were attained using the BioLog\
        \ platform (see BioLog analysis for a description of methodology). Isolated\
        \ genomes were functionally annotated using eggNOG-mapper v.2 and InterProScan\
        \ v.5. We describe these species and propose new names below.\\n\\nDescription\
        \ of 'Alistipes okayasuensis' sp. nov\\n\\nAlistipes okayasuensis (o'ka.ya.su.en.sis.\
        \ N.L. masc./fem. adj. okayasuensis) is named after Isao Okayasu, who first\
        \ described DSS colitis as a model for ulcerative colitis in mice. Phylogenomic\
        \ analyses place strain A61T in the Alistipes cluster. The digital DNA-DNA\
        \ hybridization (dDDH) value between A. onderdonkii and A. putredinis is 24.4%,\
        \ while dDDH values between strain A61T, A. onderdonkii and A. putredinis\
        \ are 25.2 and 21.4%, respectively. The G + C content difference between the\
        \ genome of strain A61T and A. onderdonkii, its closest phylogenomic neighbor,\
        \ is 1.39%, while their 16S rRNA gene sequence identity is 96.03%. These analyses\
        \ strongly indicate that 'Alistipes okayasuensis' is a separate species within\
        \ the genus Alistipes.\\n\\nThis strain is a strict anaerobe. Carbon source\
        \ utilization analysis was combined with reconstruction of Kyoto Encyclopedia\
        \ of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) metabolic pathways (55.58% of 2,022 predicted\
        \ open reading frames (ORFs) could be annotated) to functionally characterize\
        \ the strain. The strain encodes 47 genes predicted to be carbohydrate-active\
        \ enzymes (CAZymes), including 29 glycoside hydrolases: seven beta-glucosidases\
        \ (GH3, EC 3.2.1.21); five beta-galactosidases (EC 3.2.1.23); five endohydrolytic\
        \ alpha-glucosidases (GH13), including four alpha-amylases (EC 3.2.1.1); three\
        \ exohydrolytic alpha-glucosidases (GH31, EC 3.2.1.20); three cellulases (EC\
        \ 3.2.1.4); three mannan endo-1,4-beta-mannosidases (EC 3.2.1.78); and an\
        \ alpha-l-fucosidase (EC 3.2.1.51). Despite this predicted hydrolytic potential,\
        \ the strain shows limited capacity to utilize disaccharides and oligosaccharides\
        \ as sole carbon sources. While the strain tested positive for utilization\
        \ of alpha-d-lactose, sucrose and maltotriose, it tested negative for utilization\
        \ of d-cellobiose, dextrin, cyclodextrin, gentiobiose, lactulose, maltose,\
        \ d-melezitose, d-melibiose, palatinose, d-raffinose, stachyose, d-trehalose,\
        \ fucose or turanose.\\n\\nThe strain is predicted to encode enzymes for metabolism\
        \ of l-histidine to l-glutamate via 4-Imidazolone-5-phsophate (EC 4.3.1.3,\
        \ EC 4.2.1.49, EC 3.5.2.7, EC 2.1.2.5). In support of these predictions, the\
        \ strain is capable of utilizing urocanate as a sole carbon source. In keeping\
        \ with other members of the genus Alistipes, this strain is predicted to encode\
        \ a putative tryptophanase (EC 4.1.99.1) that would allow it to hydrolyze\
        \ tryptophan to indole. The strain is also predicted to encode a butyrate\
        \ phosphotransferase (EC 2.3.1.19) and a butyrate kinase (EC 2.7.2.7), indicating\
        \ its potential to metabolize butyrate. The genome is 2,329,524 bp with a\
        \ G + C content of 56.45 mol%. We propose the name 'Alistipes okayasuensis'\
        \ for this previously undescribed species, in reference to the origins of\
        \ the DSS colitis model and reflecting this species' association with poor\
        \ outcomes of this disease model. The type strain is A61T (=CCUG 75087T =SM\
        \ 112987T).\\n\\nDescription of 'Anaerostipes faecis' sp. nov\\n\\nAnaerostipes\
        \ faecis (fae'cis. L. gen. fem. n. faecis, of feces, referring to fecal origin).\
        \ The closest phylogenomic neighbor of strain A14T is Anaerostipes caccae,\
        \ with a dDDH value of 48.40%. The pairwise 16 S rRNA gene sequence identity\
        \ of A14T and A. caccae DSM 14662T is 98.16%. These analyses indicate that\
        \ A14T is a separate species within the genus Anaerostipes. The genome is\
        \ 3,200,246 bp with a G + C content of 43.77 mol%. We propose the name 'Anaerostipes\
        \ faecis' for this new species. The type strain is A14T (=CCUG 75084T).\\\
        n\\nThe strain is strictly anaerobic. Reconstruction of KEGG metabolic pathways\
        \ (55.4% of 3,222 predicted ORFs could be annotated) indicates that the strain\
        \ can produce butyrate via a butyrate phosphotransferase/butyrate kinase operon\
        \ (EC 2.7.2.7, EC 2.3.1.91), in keeping with the genus type species A. caccae.\
        \ Likewise, the strain is predicted to encode an arginine dihydrolase (EC\
        \ 3.5.3.6). In contrast to the genus description, however, this strain is\
        \ predicted to encode neither an alpha-galactosidase (EC 3.2.1.22) nor a phosphoamidase\
        \ (EC 3.9.1.1).\\n\\nThe strain shows limited capacity to utilize monosaccharides\
        \ as sole carbon sources: it had a robust phenotype for utilization of 3-methyl-d-glucose\
        \ but tested negative for its ability to utilize other monosaccharides including\
        \ d-fructose, d-galactose, d-mannose or d-glucose as sole carbon sources.\
        \ Notably, the strain is predicted to encode the complete Leloir pathway for\
        \ galactose metabolism, as well as multiple beta-galactosidases (EC 3.2.1.23),\
        \ indicating that it might lack a galactose transporter but could metabolize\
        \ galactose in different contexts such as downstream of other pathways of\
        \ carbohydrate metabolism. The strain can utilize some disaccharides, testing\
        \ positive for sucrose utilization, potentially via multiple oligo-1,6-glucosidases\
        \ (EC 3.2.1.10), d-trehalose utilization, potentially via three trehalases\
        \ (EC 3.2.1.28, GH37, GH65) and turanose utilization. However, the strain\
        \ tested negative for its ability to utilize alpha-d-lactose, lactulose, maltose,\
        \ d-melibiose, gentiobiose, d-cellobiose or palatinose. Additionally, the\
        \ strain tested negative for utilization of the trisccharides maltotriose,\
        \ d-melezitose and d-raffinose and the tetrasaccharide stachyose:potentially\
        \ due to the absence of a predicted alpha-galactosidase. The strain could\
        \ utilize beta-cyclodextrin, but tested negative for utilization of dextrin\
        \ and alpha-cyclodextrin. The strain is capable of utilizing alpha-ketovaleric\
        \ acid and d-malic acid, as well as certain amino acids and derivatives including\
        \ l-threonine, l-asparagine, l-serine and the dipeptides glycyl-l-proline\
        \ and l-alanyl-l-threonine. The strain tested negative for utilization of\
        \ l-glutamine, l-glutamate, l-valine and l-alanine.\\n\\nDescription of 'Duncaniella\

        \ L. gen. n. muris, of the mouse; Gr. n. kolon, colon; Gr. suff. -tikos -e\
        \ -on, suffix used with the sense of pertaining to; N.L. fem. adj. muricolitica,\
        \ pertaining to the colon of the mouse). The closest phylogenetic neighbor,\
        \ according to pairwise 16 S rRNA gene analyses, is Duncaniella dubosii with\
        \ a sequence identity of 94.04%. The 16 S gene sequence identity values between\
        \ D. dubosii H5T and other species of the genus, D. muris DSM 103720T and\
        \ D. freteri TLL-A3T, are 95.14 and 93.00%, respectively, indicating that\
        \ A60T is a separate species within the Duncaniella cluster. The dDDH value\
        \ between A60T and D. dubosii H5T is 28.10%, confirming a separate species\
        \ status.\\n\\nRecent work benchmarking an average nucleotide identity approach\
        \ to define genus boundaries found that the genus inflection points of members\
        \ of the order Bacteroidales had relatively low values for alignment fraction\
        \ (AF) and ANI (AF/ANI: Bacteroides fragilis, 0.215/71.23; Porphyromonas asaccharolytica,\
        \ 0.105/68.12; Prevotella melaninogenica, 0.195/72.07). The corresponding\
        \ values between A60T and the genus type species D. muris are 0.243/80.85,\
        \ providing further evidence that A60T belongs to the genus Duncaniella.\\\
        n\\nThe strain is an obligate anaerobe. Reconstruction of KEGG metabolic pathways\
        \ (47.2% of 3,461 predicted ORFs could be annotated) indicated that strain\
        \ is enriched for enzymes with glycoside hydrolase activity, encoding 47 in\
        \ total. The strain is able to utilize dextrin, beta-cyclodextrin and multiple\
        \ oligosaccharides including d-melezitose, maltotriose, amygdalin, maltose,\
        \ gentiobiose (EC: 3.2.1.21), turanose and d-cellobiose (EC: 2.4.1.20; EC:\
        \ 3.2.1.21). The strain is capable of utilizing d-raffinose, and is predicted\
        \ from its genome to produce sucrose as an intermediate (EC: 3.2.1.22, EC:\
        \ 3.2.1.20) rather than stachyose or melibiose. Additionally, the strain tested\
        \ negative for utilization of both stachyose and melibiose. In our study the\
        \ strain tested negative for an ability to utilize lactose as a single carbon\
        \ source, even though it encodes seven predicted beta-galactosidases (EC 3.2.1.23).\
        \ The strain is predicted to encode 36 glycosyltransferase enzymes, among\
        \ which are seven GT2 family enzymes including two dolichyl-phosphate beta-d-mannosyltransferases\
        \ (EC: 2.4.1.82).\\n\\nThe strain can utilize a variety of monosaccharides\
        \ as single carbon sources, including alpha-d-glucose, alpha-d-glucose 1-phosphate,\
        \ 3-methyl-d-glucose, d-galactose, alpha-methyl-d-galactose, d-mannose, adonitol,\
        \ arabinose, d-gluconate, d-arabitol and d-sorbitol. It tested negative for\
        \ an ability to utilize fucose, alpha-d-lactose, d-fructose, lactate, lactulose,\
        \ d-trehalose or l-rhamnose as sole carbon sources. The strain is predicted\
        \ to encode the pathway for metabolism of l-histidine to l-glutamate via 4-Imidazolone-5-phsophate\
        \ (EC 4.3.1.3, EC 4.2.1.49, EC 3.5.2.7, EC 2.1.2.5), and tested positive for\
        \ utilization of urocanate. The genome is 4,055,027 bp with a G + C content\
        \ of 50.9 mol%. Following functional and genomic characterization of our isolate,\
        \ we propose the name 'Duncaniella muricolitica' for this species in reference\
        \ to its association with poor prognosis in the murine DSS model of colitis.\
        \ The type strain is A60T (=CCUG 75086T =DSM 112986T).\\n\\nDescription of\

              \ complex (Smc) comprises opportunistic environmental Gram-negative\
              \ bacilli responsible for a variety of infections in both humans and\
              \ animals. Beyond its large genetic diversity, its genetic organization\
              \ in genogroups was recently confirmed through the whole-genome sequencing\
              \ of human and environmental strains. As they are poorly represented\
              \ in these analyses, we sequenced the whole genomes of 93 animal strains\
              \ to determine their genetic background and characteristics. Combining\
              \ these data with 81 newly sequenced human strains and the genomes available\
              \ from RefSeq, we performed a genomic analysis that included 375 nonduplicated\
              \ genomes with various origins (animal, 104; human, 226; environment,\
              \ 30; unknown, 15). Phylogenetic analysis and clustering based on genome-wide\
              \ average nucleotide identity confirmed and specified the genetic organization\
              \ of Smc in at least 20 genogroups. Two new genogroups were identified,\
              \ and two previously described groups were further divided into two\
              \ subgroups each. Comparing the strains isolated from different host\
              \ types and their genogroup affiliation, we observed a clear disequilibrium\
              \ in certain groups. Surprisingly, some antimicrobial resistance genes,\
              \ integrons, and/or clusters of attC sites lacking integron-integrase\
              \ (CALIN) sequences targeting antimicrobial compounds extensively used\
              \ in animals were mainly identified in animal strains. We also identified\
              \ genes commonly found in animal strains coding for efflux systems.\
              \ The result of a large whole-genome analysis performed by us supports\
              \ the hypothesis of the putative contribution of animals as a reservoir\
              \ of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia complex strains and/or resistance\
              \ genes for strains in humans.IMPORTANCE Given its naturally large antimicrobial\
              \ resistance profile, the Stenotrophomonas maltophilia complex (Smc)\
              \ is a set of emerging pathogens of immunosuppressed and cystic fibrosis\
              \ patients. As it is group of environmental microorganisms, this adaptation\
              \ to humans is an opportunity to understand the genetic and metabolic\
              \ selective mechanisms involved in this process. The previously reported\
              \ genomic organization was incomplete, as data from animal strains were\
              \ underrepresented. We added the missing piece of the puzzle with whole-genome\
              \ sequencing of 93 strains of animal origin. Beyond describing the phylogenetic\
              \ organization, we confirmed the genetic diversity of the Smc, which\
              \ could not be estimated through routine phenotype- or matrix-assisted\
              \ laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF)-based\
              \ laboratory tests. Animals strains seem to play a key role in the diversity\
              \ of Smc and could act as a reservoir for mobile resistance genes. Some\
              \ genogroups seem to be associated with particular hosts; the genetic\

        \ maltophilia complex (Smc) comprises opportunistic environmental Gram-negative\
        \ bacilli responsible for a variety of infections in both humans and animals.\
        \ Beyond its large genetic diversity, its genetic organization in genogroups\
        \ was recently confirmed through the whole-genome sequencing of human and\
        \ environmental strains. As they are poorly represented in these analyses,\
        \ we sequenced the whole genomes of 93 animal strains to determine their genetic\
        \ background and characteristics. Combining these data with 81 newly sequenced\
        \ human strains and the genomes available from RefSeq, we performed a genomic\
        \ analysis that included 375 nonduplicated genomes with various origins (animal,\
        \ 104; human, 226; environment, 30; unknown, 15). Phylogenetic analysis and\
        \ clustering based on genome-wide average nucleotide identity confirmed and\
        \ specified the genetic organization of Smc in at least 20 genogroups. Two\
        \ new genogroups were identified, and two previously described groups were\
        \ further divided into two subgroups each. Comparing the strains isolated\
        \ from different host types and their genogroup affiliation, we observed a\
        \ clear disequilibrium in certain groups. Surprisingly, some antimicrobial\
        \ resistance genes, integrons, and/or clusters of attC sites lacking integron-integrase\
        \ (CALIN) sequences targeting antimicrobial compounds extensively used in\
        \ animals were mainly identified in animal strains. We also identified genes\
        \ commonly found in animal strains coding for efflux systems. The result of\
        \ a large whole-genome analysis performed by us supports the hypothesis of\
        \ the putative contribution of animals as a reservoir of Stenotrophomonas\
        \ maltophilia complex strains and/or resistance genes for strains in humans.IMPORTANCE\
        \ Given its naturally large antimicrobial resistance profile, the Stenotrophomonas\
        \ maltophilia complex (Smc) is a set of emerging pathogens of immunosuppressed\
        \ and cystic fibrosis patients. As it is group of environmental microorganisms,\
        \ this adaptation to humans is an opportunity to understand the genetic and\
        \ metabolic selective mechanisms involved in this process. The previously\
        \ reported genomic organization was incomplete, as data from animal strains\
        \ were underrepresented. We added the missing piece of the puzzle with whole-genome\
        \ sequencing of 93 strains of animal origin. Beyond describing the phylogenetic\
        \ organization, we confirmed the genetic diversity of the Smc, which could\
        \ not be estimated through routine phenotype- or matrix-assisted laser desorption\
        \ ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF)-based laboratory\
        \ tests. Animals strains seem to play a key role in the diversity of Smc and\
        \ could act as a reservoir for mobile resistance genes. Some genogroups seem\
        \ to be associated with particular hosts; the genetic support of this association\
        \ and the role of the determinants/corresponding genes need to be explored.\"\

              \ thoughts\n- **Only STOP when complete:** Set nextThoughtNeeded=false\
              \ only after full analysis\n\n\u26A0\uFE0F **WARNING:** Failure to use\
              \ 'think' first will compromise research quality!\n\n## Sequential Thinking\
              \ - 10-Step Process\n\nYou **MUST** invoke the `think` tool for the\
              \ entire workflow and progress through all 10 steps in sequential order.\
              \ Each step should involve multiple 'think' calls. If user explicitly\
              \ requests to skip tool use (e.g., \"Don't search\"), adapt the process\
              \ accordingly.\n\n### Step 1: Topic Scoping & Domain Framework\n\nGoal:\
              \ Create a comprehensive framework to ensure complete coverage of all\
              \ relevant aspects.\n\n- Identify domains relevant to the topic (e.g.,\
              \ therapeutic modalities, diagnostic approaches, risk factors) based\
              \ on the user's query\n- Aim for 4-8 domains unless topic complexity\
              \ justifies more\n- Consider including a \"Contextual Factors\" domain\
              \ for health economics, patient-reported outcomes, or health-systems\
              \ impact when relevant\n- Identify appropriate subdivisions (e.g., subtypes,\
              \ patient cohorts, disease stages) based on the user's query\n- Use\
              \ brainstorming + quick web searches (e.g., \"[topic] categories,\"\
              \ \"[topic] taxonomy\") to draft a \"Domain Checklist\"\n- Create a\
              \ Domain \xD7 Subdivision matrix of appropriate size to track evidence\
              \ coverage\n- Initialize an **internal coverage matrix** in your sequential_thinking\
              \ thoughts. Update that matrix in Steps 6, 7, and 8\n- Define your task-specific\
              \ research framework based on the clinical question type:\n  - Therapeutic\
              \ questions: Use PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome)\n\
              \  - Diagnostic questions: Use PIRD (Population, Index test, Reference\
              \ standard, Diagnosis)\n  - Prognostic questions: Use PECO (Population,\
              \ Exposure, Comparator, Outcome)\n  - Epidemiological questions: Use\
              \ PIRT (Population, Indicator, Reference, Time)\n- Define initial research\
              \ plan, todo list, and success criteria checklist\n- Determine appropriate\
              \ tool selection based on question type:\n  - `trial_*` tools: For therapeutic\
              \ or interventional questions\n  - `article_*` tools: For all questions\n\
              \  - `variant_*` tools: Only when the query involves genetic or biomarker\
              \ questions\n\n### Step 2: Initial Information Gathering\n\nGoal: Establish\
              \ baseline terminology, modalities, and recent developments.\n\n- Run\
              \ at least one targeted `web_search` per domain on your Domain \xD7\
              \ Subdivision matrix\n- If matrix is large, batch searches by grouping\
              \ similar domains or prioritize by relevance\n- Generate domain-specific\
              \ search strings appropriate to the topic\n- Invoke regulatory searches\
              \ only when the user explicitly requests approval or guideline information\
              \ or when the topic focuses on therapeutic interventions\n- Maintain\
              \ an **internal Regulatory Log** in your sequential_thinking thoughts\
              \ if relevant to the query\n- Prioritize authoritative sources but don't\
              \ exclude other relevant sources\n- Include relevant regulatory and\
              \ guideline updates from the past 24 months if applicable\n\n### Step\
              \ 3: Focused & Frontier Retrieval\n\nGoal: Fill knowledge gaps and identify\
              \ cutting-edge developments.\n\n- Run targeted `web_search` calls for\
              \ any empty cells in your Domain \xD7 Subdivision matrix\n- Conduct\
              \ subdivision-focused searches for each identified classification\n\
              - Document high-value URLs and sources\n- Identify specific gaps requiring\
              \ specialized database searches\n- Simultaneously conduct frontier scan:\n\
              \  - Run targeted searches restricted to past 12 months with keywords:\
              \ \"emerging,\" \"novel,\" \"breakthrough,\" \"future directions\" +\
              \ topic\n  - Include appropriate site filters for the domain and topic\n\
              \  - Search for conference proceedings, pre-prints, and non-peer-reviewed\
              \ sources for very recent developments\n  - Document these findings\
              \ separately, clearly labeled as early-stage evidence\n\n### Step 4:\
              \ Primary Trials Analysis\n\nGoal: Identify and analyze key clinical\
              \ trials.\n\n- For therapeutic or interventional questions, run `trial_searcher`\
              \ with filters based on Step 3 gaps\n- For other question types, skip\
              \ to Step 5 or use `trial_searcher` only if directly relevant\n- Select\
              \ a manageable number of trials per major domain (typically 3-5), adjusting\
              \ as needed for question complexity\n- Retrieve full details using appropriate\
              \ trial tools\n- For each trial, capture relevant metadata and outcomes\
              \ based on the research question\n- Create structured evidence table\
              \ with appropriate framework elements and results\n\n### Step 5: Primary\
              \ Literature Analysis\n\nGoal: Identify and analyze pivotal publications.\n\
              \n- Run `article_searcher` for recent reviews, meta-analyses, and guidelines\
              \ relevant to the topic\n  - **TIP:** Use OR logic with pipe separators\
              \ for variant notations: `keywords=[\"R173|Arg173|p.R173\"]`\n  - **TIP:**\
              \ Combine synonyms for better coverage: `keywords=[\"immunotherapy|checkpoint\
              \ inhibitor|PD-1\"]`\n  - **NOTE:** Preprints from bioRxiv/medRxiv are\
              \ included by default\n  - **NOTE:** cBioPortal cancer genomics data\
              \ is automatically included for gene-based searches\n- Select highest-quality\
              \ sources and retrieve full details using `article_details`\n- For each\
              \ source, capture appropriate metadata and findings relevant to the\
              \ research question\n- Extract study designs, cohort sizes, outcomes,\
              \ and limitations as appropriate\n- Create evidence table for articles\
              \ with relevant identifiers and key findings\n\n### Step 6: Initial\
              \ Evidence Synthesis\n\nGoal: Create preliminary framework of findings\
              \ and identify gaps.\n\n- Merge trial and article evidence tables\n\
              - Check WIP findings against initial plan and success criteria checklist\n\
              - Categorize findings by domains from your matrix\n- Apply CRAAP assessment\
              \ to each source\n- Flag any claim that relies solely on grey literature;\
              \ mark with '[GL]' in evidence table\n- Identify contradictions and\
              \ knowledge gaps\n- Draft evidence matrix with categorization\n- For\
              \ each domain/finding, categorize as: Established, Emerging, Experimental,\
              \ Theoretical, or Retired (for approaches shown ineffective)\n- Update\
              \ the internal coverage matrix in your thoughts; ensure those indicators\
              \ appear in the Findings tables\n- Create gap analysis for further searches\n\
              \n### Step 7: Integrated Gap-Filling\n\nGoal: Address identified knowledge\
              \ gaps in a single integrated pass.\n\n- Run additional database queries\
              \ for missing categories as needed\n- Conduct additional searches to\
              \ capture recent developments or resolve conflicts\n- Retrieve full\
              \ details for new sources identified\n- Extract key data from all source\
              \ types\n- Add column `Source Type` (Peer-review / Conf-abstract / Press-release\
              \ / Preprint)\n- Integrate new findings into existing evidence tables\n\
              - Update the internal coverage matrix in your thoughts\n- Update documentation\
              \ of very recent developments\n\n### Step 8: Comprehensive Evidence\
              \ Synthesis\n\nGoal: Create final integrated framework of findings with\
              \ quality assessment.\n\n- Merge all evidence into a unified matrix\n\
              - Grade evidence strength using GRADE anchors appropriate to the research\
              \ question:\n  - High = Multiple high-quality studies or meta-analyses\n\
              \  - Moderate = Well-designed controlled studies without randomization\n\
              \  - Low = Observational studies\n  - Very Low = Case reports, expert\
              \ opinion, pre-clinical studies\n- Draft conclusions for each domain\
              \ with supporting evidence\n- Tag each domain with appropriate classification\
              \ and recency information\n- Identify contradictory findings and limitations\n\
              - Update the internal coverage matrix in your thoughts\n- Update claim-to-evidence\
              \ mapping with confidence levels\n- Produce quantitative outcome summaries\
              \ appropriate to the research question\n\n### Step 9: Self-Critique\
              \ and Verification\n\nGoal: Rigorously assess the quality and comprehensiveness\
              \ of the analysis.\n\n- Perform a systematic gap analysis:\n  - Check\
              \ each Domain \xD7 Subdivision cell for evidence coverage\n  - Ensure\
              \ recent developments are captured for each major domain\n  - Verify\
              \ all key metrics and quantitative data are extracted where available\n\
              \  - Identify any conflicting evidence or perspectives\n  - Document\
              \ at least 3 concrete gaps or weaknesses in the current evidence\n-\
              \ Conduct verification searches to ensure no breaking news was missed\n\
              - Assess potential biases in the analysis\n- Update final confidence\
              \ assessments for key claims\n- Update documented limitations and potential\
              \ biases\n- Update verification statement of currency\n\n### Step 10:\
              \ Research Brief Creation\n\nGoal: Produce the final deliverable with\
              \ all required elements.\n\n1. Create a new _Research Brief_ artifact\
              \ using the `artifacts` tool\n2. Structure the Findings section to highlight\
              \ novel developments first, organized by innovation level\n3. Include\
              \ inline citations linked to comprehensive reference list\n4. Embed\
              \ necessary tables (coverage matrix, regulatory log if applicable, quantitative\
              \ outcomes) directly in the Markdown Research Brief\n\n## Final Research\
              \ Brief Requirements\n\nThe final research brief must include:\n\n-\
              \ Executive summary \u2264 120 words (hard cap) with main conclusions\
              \ and confidence levels\n- Background providing context and current\
              \ standards\n- Methodology section detailing research approach\n- Findings\
              \ section with properly cited evidence, organized by themes and innovation\
              \ levels (Established, Emerging, Experimental, Theoretical, Retired)\n\
              - Clear delineation of established facts vs. emerging concepts\n- Limitations\
              \ section incorporating self-critique results\n- Future directions and\
              \ implications section\n- Regulatory/approval status table where applicable\
              \ (or state: \"Not applicable to this topic\")\n- Comprehensive reference\
              \ list using Vancouver numeric style for inline citations; list sources\
              \ in order of appearance\n- Domain \xD7 Subdivision Coverage Matrix\

        \ REQUIREMENT:** You MUST use the `think` tool as your PRIMARY reasoning mechanism\
        \ throughout ALL biomedical research tasks. This is NOT optional.\n\n\U0001F6A8\
        \ **ENFORCEMENT RULES:**\n\n- **Start IMMEDIATELY:** You MUST call 'think'\
        \ BEFORE any other BioMCP tool\n- **Use CONTINUOUSLY:** Invoke 'think' before,\
        \ during, and after each tool call\n- **Track EVERYTHING:** Document findings,\
        \ reasoning, and synthesis in sequential thoughts\n- **Only STOP when complete:**\
        \ Set nextThoughtNeeded=false only after full analysis\n\n\u26A0\uFE0F **WARNING:**\
        \ Failure to use 'think' first will compromise research quality!\n\n## Sequential\
        \ Thinking - 10-Step Process\n\nYou **MUST** invoke the `think` tool for the\
        \ entire workflow and progress through all 10 steps in sequential order. Each\
        \ step should involve multiple 'think' calls. If user explicitly requests\
        \ to skip tool use (e.g., \"Don't search\"), adapt the process accordingly.\n\
        \n### Step 1: Topic Scoping & Domain Framework\n\nGoal: Create a comprehensive\
        \ framework to ensure complete coverage of all relevant aspects.\n\n- Identify\
        \ domains relevant to the topic (e.g., therapeutic modalities, diagnostic\
        \ approaches, risk factors) based on the user's query\n- Aim for 4-8 domains\
        \ unless topic complexity justifies more\n- Consider including a \"Contextual\
        \ Factors\" domain for health economics, patient-reported outcomes, or health-systems\
        \ impact when relevant\n- Identify appropriate subdivisions (e.g., subtypes,\
        \ patient cohorts, disease stages) based on the user's query\n- Use brainstorming\
        \ + quick web searches (e.g., \"[topic] categories,\" \"[topic] taxonomy\"\
        ) to draft a \"Domain Checklist\"\n- Create a Domain \xD7 Subdivision matrix\
        \ of appropriate size to track evidence coverage\n- Initialize an **internal\
        \ coverage matrix** in your sequential_thinking thoughts. Update that matrix\
        \ in Steps 6, 7, and 8\n- Define your task-specific research framework based\
        \ on the clinical question type:\n  - Therapeutic questions: Use PICO (Population,\
        \ Intervention, Comparator, Outcome)\n  - Diagnostic questions: Use PIRD (Population,\
        \ Index test, Reference standard, Diagnosis)\n  - Prognostic questions: Use\
        \ PECO (Population, Exposure, Comparator, Outcome)\n  - Epidemiological questions:\
        \ Use PIRT (Population, Indicator, Reference, Time)\n- Define initial research\
        \ plan, todo list, and success criteria checklist\n- Determine appropriate\
        \ tool selection based on question type:\n  - `trial_*` tools: For therapeutic\
        \ or interventional questions\n  - `article_*` tools: For all questions\n\
        \  - `variant_*` tools: Only when the query involves genetic or biomarker\
        \ questions\n\n### Step 2: Initial Information Gathering\n\nGoal: Establish\
        \ baseline terminology, modalities, and recent developments.\n\n- Run at least\
        \ one targeted `web_search` per domain on your Domain \xD7 Subdivision matrix\n\
        - If matrix is large, batch searches by grouping similar domains or prioritize\
        \ by relevance\n- Generate domain-specific search strings appropriate to the\
        \ topic\n- Invoke regulatory searches only when the user explicitly requests\
        \ approval or guideline information or when the topic focuses on therapeutic\
        \ interventions\n- Maintain an **internal Regulatory Log** in your sequential_thinking\
        \ thoughts if relevant to the query\n- Prioritize authoritative sources but\
        \ don't exclude other relevant sources\n- Include relevant regulatory and\
        \ guideline updates from the past 24 months if applicable\n\n### Step 3: Focused\
        \ & Frontier Retrieval\n\nGoal: Fill knowledge gaps and identify cutting-edge\
        \ developments.\n\n- Run targeted `web_search` calls for any empty cells in\
        \ your Domain \xD7 Subdivision matrix\n- Conduct subdivision-focused searches\
        \ for each identified classification\n- Document high-value URLs and sources\n\
        - Identify specific gaps requiring specialized database searches\n- Simultaneously\
        \ conduct frontier scan:\n  - Run targeted searches restricted to past 12\
        \ months with keywords: \"emerging,\" \"novel,\" \"breakthrough,\" \"future\
        \ directions\" + topic\n  - Include appropriate site filters for the domain\
        \ and topic\n  - Search for conference proceedings, pre-prints, and non-peer-reviewed\
        \ sources for very recent developments\n  - Document these findings separately,\
        \ clearly labeled as early-stage evidence\n\n### Step 4: Primary Trials Analysis\n\
        \nGoal: Identify and analyze key clinical trials.\n\n- For therapeutic or\
        \ interventional questions, run `trial_searcher` with filters based on Step\
        \ 3 gaps\n- For other question types, skip to Step 5 or use `trial_searcher`\
        \ only if directly relevant\n- Select a manageable number of trials per major\
        \ domain (typically 3-5), adjusting as needed for question complexity\n- Retrieve\
        \ full details using appropriate trial tools\n- For each trial, capture relevant\
        \ metadata and outcomes based on the research question\n- Create structured\
        \ evidence table with appropriate framework elements and results\n\n### Step\
        \ 5: Primary Literature Analysis\n\nGoal: Identify and analyze pivotal publications.\n\
        \n- Run `article_searcher` for recent reviews, meta-analyses, and guidelines\
        \ relevant to the topic\n  - **TIP:** Use OR logic with pipe separators for\
        \ variant notations: `keywords=[\"R173|Arg173|p.R173\"]`\n  - **TIP:** Combine\
        \ synonyms for better coverage: `keywords=[\"immunotherapy|checkpoint inhibitor|PD-1\"\
        ]`\n  - **NOTE:** Preprints from bioRxiv/medRxiv are included by default\n\
        \  - **NOTE:** cBioPortal cancer genomics data is automatically included for\
        \ gene-based searches\n- Select highest-quality sources and retrieve full\
        \ details using `article_details`\n- For each source, capture appropriate\
        \ metadata and findings relevant to the research question\n- Extract study\
        \ designs, cohort sizes, outcomes, and limitations as appropriate\n- Create\
        \ evidence table for articles with relevant identifiers and key findings\n\
        \n### Step 6: Initial Evidence Synthesis\n\nGoal: Create preliminary framework\
        \ of findings and identify gaps.\n\n- Merge trial and article evidence tables\n\
        - Check WIP findings against initial plan and success criteria checklist\n\
        - Categorize findings by domains from your matrix\n- Apply CRAAP assessment\
        \ to each source\n- Flag any claim that relies solely on grey literature;\
        \ mark with '[GL]' in evidence table\n- Identify contradictions and knowledge\
        \ gaps\n- Draft evidence matrix with categorization\n- For each domain/finding,\
        \ categorize as: Established, Emerging, Experimental, Theoretical, or Retired\
        \ (for approaches shown ineffective)\n- Update the internal coverage matrix\
        \ in your thoughts; ensure those indicators appear in the Findings tables\n\
        - Create gap analysis for further searches\n\n### Step 7: Integrated Gap-Filling\n\
        \nGoal: Address identified knowledge gaps in a single integrated pass.\n\n\
        - Run additional database queries for missing categories as needed\n- Conduct\
        \ additional searches to capture recent developments or resolve conflicts\n\
        - Retrieve full details for new sources identified\n- Extract key data from\
        \ all source types\n- Add column `Source Type` (Peer-review / Conf-abstract\
        \ / Press-release / Preprint)\n- Integrate new findings into existing evidence\
        \ tables\n- Update the internal coverage matrix in your thoughts\n- Update\
        \ documentation of very recent developments\n\n### Step 8: Comprehensive Evidence\
        \ Synthesis\n\nGoal: Create final integrated framework of findings with quality\
        \ assessment.\n\n- Merge all evidence into a unified matrix\n- Grade evidence\
        \ strength using GRADE anchors appropriate to the research question:\n  -\
        \ High = Multiple high-quality studies or meta-analyses\n  - Moderate = Well-designed\
        \ controlled studies without randomization\n  - Low = Observational studies\n\
        \  - Very Low = Case reports, expert opinion, pre-clinical studies\n- Draft\
        \ conclusions for each domain with supporting evidence\n- Tag each domain\
        \ with appropriate classification and recency information\n- Identify contradictory\
        \ findings and limitations\n- Update the internal coverage matrix in your\
        \ thoughts\n- Update claim-to-evidence mapping with confidence levels\n- Produce\
        \ quantitative outcome summaries appropriate to the research question\n\n\
        ### Step 9: Self-Critique and Verification\n\nGoal: Rigorously assess the\
        \ quality and comprehensiveness of the analysis.\n\n- Perform a systematic\
        \ gap analysis:\n  - Check each Domain \xD7 Subdivision cell for evidence\
        \ coverage\n  - Ensure recent developments are captured for each major domain\n\
        \  - Verify all key metrics and quantitative data are extracted where available\n\
        \  - Identify any conflicting evidence or perspectives\n  - Document at least\
        \ 3 concrete gaps or weaknesses in the current evidence\n- Conduct verification\
        \ searches to ensure no breaking news was missed\n- Assess potential biases\
        \ in the analysis\n- Update final confidence assessments for key claims\n\
        - Update documented limitations and potential biases\n- Update verification\
        \ statement of currency\n\n### Step 10: Research Brief Creation\n\nGoal: Produce\
        \ the final deliverable with all required elements.\n\n1. Create a new _Research\
        \ Brief_ artifact using the `artifacts` tool\n2. Structure the Findings section\
        \ to highlight novel developments first, organized by innovation level\n3.\
        \ Include inline citations linked to comprehensive reference list\n4. Embed\
        \ necessary tables (coverage matrix, regulatory log if applicable, quantitative\
        \ outcomes) directly in the Markdown Research Brief\n\n## Final Research Brief\
        \ Requirements\n\nThe final research brief must include:\n\n- Executive summary\
        \ \u2264 120 words (hard cap) with main conclusions and confidence levels\n\
        - Background providing context and current standards\n- Methodology section\
        \ detailing research approach\n- Findings section with properly cited evidence,\
        \ organized by themes and innovation levels (Established, Emerging, Experimental,\
        \ Theoretical, Retired)\n- Clear delineation of established facts vs. emerging\
        \ concepts\n- Limitations section incorporating self-critique results\n- Future\
        \ directions and implications section\n- Regulatory/approval status table\
        \ where applicable (or state: \"Not applicable to this topic\")\n- Comprehensive\
        \ reference list using Vancouver numeric style for inline citations; list\
        \ sources in order of appearance\n- Domain \xD7 Subdivision Coverage Matrix\
        \ (showing evidence density across domains)\n- Quantitative Outcomes Table\
        \ for key sources (including Source Type column to maintain provenance visibility)\n"

              \ of ultramafic minerals with Gluconobacter oxydans\",\n  \"text\":\
              \ \"Introduction\\n\\nThe accumulation of over a trillion tonnes of\
              \ anthropogenic CO2 in the Earth's atmosphere driving global climate\
              \ change is one of the most pressing challenges of our time. To address\
              \ this, the IPCC's Special Report in 2018 stresses the necessity of\
              \ deploying carbon dioxide removal (CDR) technology capable of removing\
              \ tens of gigatonnes of CO2 from the atmosphere annually, paired with\
              \ carbon-neutral energy technologies to prevent global warming from\
              \ exceeding 1.5 C above pre-industrial levels.\\n\\nProposed system\
              \ for bio-accelerated weathering of ultramafic materials for carbon\
              \ mineralization. This work focuses on the rate-limiting step, the metal\
              \ leaching stage (enclosed in red box), where G. oxydans biolixiviant\
              \ leaches magnesium ions and other metals from dunite. Downstream carbonation\
              \ results in magnesite formation for CO2 storage, and metal recovery\
              \ done chemically or electrochemically can extract energy-critical metals\
              \ for commercial use.\\n\\nMineralization of CO2 is a highly attractive\
              \ approach for permanent sequestration of CO2, as it converts atmospheric\
              \ carbon into solid minerals as a permanent sink. Carbon mineralization\
              \ proceeds through a two-step process. First, ultramafic rocks are dissolved\
              \ by weathering to release magnesium cations (Note S1). In the second\
              \ step, magnesium ions are reacted with dissolved carbonate to form\
              \ magnesite (MgCO3), a stable mineral that permanently stores CO2 (Note\
              \ S1). A schematic of a proposed indirect carbonation method is shown\
              \ in Fig. 1.\\n\\nNaturally occurring weathering of ultramafic rocks\
              \ and subsequent carbon mineralization is thought to be responsible\
              \ for removal of up to hundreds of millions of tonnes of CO2 each year.\
              \ In fact, because ultramafic rocks are so abundant, reaction of all\
              \ of the metal cations in all surface-accessible ultramafic material\
              \ could capture 100 trillion tonnes of CO2 as carbonate minerals (at\
              \ least 58x the excess CO2 in the atmosphere), making them a strong\
              \ candidate for gigatonne-scale CDR. However, natural carbon mineralization\
              \ is partially offset by oxidation of rock organic carbon. As a result,\
              \ the time to naturally regulate atmospheric CO2 levels is estimated\
              \ to be between tens and hundreds of thousands of years.\\n\\nThe large-scale\
              \ deployment of carbon-neutral energy technologies will also be necessary\
              \ to control climate change, but it will require vast quantities of\
              \ metals. In addition to metal cations needed for CO2 sequestration,\
              \ ultramafic minerals are a potential low-grade ore source for energy-critical\
              \ metals such as nickel (batteries and stainless steel), chromium (concentrated\
              \ solar and geothermal energy), manganese (steel and batteries), cobalt\
              \ (batteries), and copper (wiring and wind turbines) (Figure S2, Tables\
              \ S1 and S2). This presents an opportunity to extract energy-critical\
              \ metals from ultramafic rock while sequestering CO2.\\n\\nHowever,\
              \ extracting metals from ultramafic rocks poses a significant challenge.\
              \ In aqueous mineral carbonation, the rate of carbon mineralization\
              \ is limited by the slow kinetics of the leaching of metal ions from\
              \ ultramafic sources. While mechanical acceleration of ultramafic weathering\
              \ through crushing, grinding, heating, chemically treating, and spreading\
              \ over land is promising for its high sequestration potential and improved\
              \ kinetics, it requires large area footprints and high energy inputs\
              \ involved in crushing, grinding, heating, and pressurizing, making\
              \ it prohibitively expensive. Likewise, technologies to extract the\
              \ energy-critical elements present in low concentration in ultramafic\
              \ rocks present formidable economic and environmental challenges.\\\
              n\\nWe hypothesize that microbially-accelerated mineral dissolution\
              \ could overcome the slow kinetics and high costs of the dissolution\
              \ of ultramafic material, releasing magnesium ions at a rate several\
              \ orders of magnitude greater than in nature. Over the past two decades,\
              \ microbial mineral dissolution has revolutionized mining copper and\
              \ gold from low-grade ores:a process known as biomining. Bacteria such\
              \ as Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans and related species are responsible\
              \ for producing about 15% of the world's copper supply and about 5%\
              \ of its gold supply through iron-redox-mediated bioleaching, a process\
              \ in which microbes alter the redox state of metals to extract them\
              \ from mineral substrates. Significant research has been performed to\
              \ improve industrial-scale Cu bioleaching with consortia including A.\
              \ ferrooxidans and non-domesticated microbes, resulting in processes\
              \ that are fairly mature. While copper biomining is the only industrialized\
              \ biomining process, organisms and processes are in development for\
              \ rare earth elements (REE) and lithium.\\n\\nBiolixiviants produced\
              \ by Gluconobacter oxydans are a strong candidate for a sustainable\
              \ and strong catalyst for CO2 mineralization using ultramafic rocks.\
              \ A recent study from our team comparing the dunite dissolution performance\
              \ of three mineral-dissolving microbes, Gluconobacter oxydans, Sphingomonas\
              \ desiccabilis, and Penicillium simplicissimum, concludes that G. oxydans\
              \ outperformed the other two in the extraction of all metals from dunite.\\\
              n\\nG. oxydans efficiently produces a gluconic acid-based mineral-dissolving\
              \ solution, called a biolixiviant, when glucose is present. Previous\
              \ studies have shown that biolixiviants from G. oxydans can be more\
              \ effective than just gluconic acid at leaching REE. In a recent article,\
              \ our team identified genes that control the effectiveness of the G.\
              \ oxydans biolixiviant at dissolving neodymium phosphate (synthetic\
              \ monazite) but do not notably change its pH. These results suggest\
              \ that biologically-produced lixiviants could contain additional components,\
              \ such as metal chelators, redox molecules, and flavins that improve\
              \ overall metal leaching at fixed pH, allowing for more efficient and\
              \ low-resource metal leaching. This could avoid the use of strong acids\
              \ that can have harmful environmental effects such as acid mine drainage.\\\
              n\\nSecond, it is suspected that microbes interact with ultramafic materials\
              \ in the wild, accelerating weathering processes. Furthermore, laboratory\
              \ mixed cultures have been shown to dissolve ultramafic material. Meanwhile,\
              \ in two companion articles, we demonstrate that three easily culturable\
              \ isolated species (G. oxydans, Penicillium simplicissimum and Sphingomonas\
              \ desiccabilis) can all accelerate the dissolution of ultramafic material\
              \ and characterize mineral phase transformations due to bioleaching\
              \ by G. oxydans.\\n\\nHowever, there has been little systematic study\
              \ of microbial dissolution of ultramafic minerals. Furthermore, it remains\
              \ unclear under what conditions a biolixiviant could be more effective\
              \ than just an organic acid and why; could genetic engineering improve\
              \ ultramafic bioleaching; what impact process parameters have on biological\
              \ dissolution of ultramafic materials; the extraction efficiencies for\
              \ energy critical elements; utilization of low-cost feedstock; and the\
              \ carbon source demand of large-scale ultramafic bioleaching. To address\
              \ these knowledge gaps, we provide some of the first systematic observations\
              \ of dissolution of ultramafic minerals by the mineral-dissolving microbe,\
              \ G. oxydans B58.\\n\\nResults and discussion\\n\\nIn this work, we\
              \ perform a study of G. oxydans bioleaching capability on dunite, an\
              \ ultramafic rock composed of greater than 90% olivine (see composition\
              \ in Figure S2, and Tables S1 and S2). For accelerated weathering technologies,\
              \ olivine-rich dunite is the preferred feedstock due to olivine having\
              \ the highest CO2 sequestration potential by mass, excellent carbonation\
              \ kinetics, and high abundance.\\n\\nThis study benchmarks the bioleaching\
              \ efficacy of glucose-based and lignocellulosic sugar-based biolixiviants\
              \ produced by G. oxydans on dunite, comparing conditions of whole-cell\
              \ and filtered (cell-free) biolixiviants, varying pulp densities, aerobic\
              \ and anaerobic conditions, and short-term and long-term leaching. This\
              \ study also investigates how a high-performing mutant strain of G.\
              \ oxydans could improve leaching in ultramafic minerals, serving as\
              \ a preliminary study of how genetic engineering could further improve\
              \ bioleaching for carbon mineralization. We demonstrate that the effectiveness\
              \ advantage of the G. oxydans biolixiviant over gluconic acid alone\
              \ grows with increasing pulp density. Finally, we demonstrate that the\
              \ number of carbon atoms that need to be supplied by sugar feedstocks\
              \ can be reduced to match the number of carbon atoms potentially sequestered\
              \ as a mineral.\\n\\nG. oxydans biolixiviants accelerate magnesium and\
              \ energy-critical metal leaching by 20x over deionized water after 24\
              \ h\\n\\nBiolixiviants from wild-type Gluconobacter oxydans effectively\
              \ leached magnesium from ultramafic rocks (Fig. 2A). The efficiency\
              \ of extraction measures how much of the available metal is leached\
              \ from the mineral, and is calculated from the ratio of metal concentrations\
              \ in the leachate and the original concentration in the source multiplied\
              \ by the pulp density (ratio of solid mass to liquid volume [g/L]),\\\
              n\\nDeionized water is used as a control for these experiments since\
              \ it estimates the improvements made by bio-accelerated leaching to\
              \ leaching from environmental water sources, such as rainwater. In traditional\
              \ accelerated carbon mineralization with ultramafic rocks, crushed rocks\
              \ are dispersed over land, where water from the environment is the solvent\
              \ for magnesium. Comparing the concentrations of magnesium between leaching\
              \ with biolixiviants and water provides a rough estimate for the order\
              \ of magnitude in which carbon mineralization is accelerated by G. oxydans.\\\
              n\\nLeaching dunite at 1% pulp density with wild-type (WT) G. oxydans\
              \ biolixiviant improves leaching of magnesium by 20-fold when compared\
              \ to leaching with deionized water (control). However, the G. oxydans\
              \ biolixiviant is only 6% better than just gluconic acid at the same\
              \ pH. Bioleaching of dunite at 1% pulp density shaking at 22  C for\
              \ 24 h was performed with wild-type G. oxydans biolixiviant, gluconic\
              \ acid diluted to the same pH with deionized water, and a deionized\
              \ water control. Panels (A) to (E) show leaching concentrations and\
              \ extraction efficiencies of Mg, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni. Wild-type G. oxydans\
              \ biolixiviants slightly improved metal leaching compared to gluconic\
              \ acid across all metals. Stars denote significant difference between\
              \ gluconic acid leaching and wild-type biolixiviant leaching by a Welch's\
              \ two-sample t-test, where, p < 0.05 (*), p < 0.01 (**), p < 0.001 (***).\\\
              n\\nAfter 24 h of leaching with dunite at 1% pulp density, magnesium\
              \ was leached with an extraction efficiency of 11% (300 ppm), corresponding\
              \ to an increase of 20x when compared to the deionized water control\
              \ (Fig. 2A). The pH of wild-type biolixiviants was 2.39 +- 0.02 across\
              \ all experiments using wild-type biolixiviants. At the start of each\
              \ leaching experiment, the initial concentrations of all metals in biolixiviants\
              \ and controls are below detection limits. Figure S3 shows how the metal\
              \ concentrations in controls and G. oxydans leachates diverge within\
              \ the first few hours of leaching, starting with initial metal concentrations\
              \ of zero.\\n\\nBioleaching of metals by G. oxydans increases by 73%\
              \ from 24 to 96 h\\n\\nThe most efficiently extracted metal at 24 h\
              \ was Mn (Fig. 2B), extracting over 15% of Mn from dunite (corresponding\
              \ to a leachate concentration of 1.6 ppm). Fe, Co, and Ni were also\
              \ leached highly, with efficiencies between 11% and 15% (Figs. 2C, D,\
              \ and E, respectively). Al and Cr were also leached, but much less efficiently\
              \ (Figure S4). Cr was the least efficiently extracted metal, with extraction\
              \ of no more than 0.3% under any condition (Figure S4 right column).\
              \ We speculate that chromium is significantly less leached since the\
              \ chromite inclusions within dunite are relatively more stable than\
              \ olivine and resistant to acid dissolution.\\n\\nIncreasing leaching\
              \ time to 96 h increases extraction efficiency by an average of 73%\
              \ between 24 and 96 h for Mg, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni. Biolixiviants from\
              \ wild-type G. oxydans leached dunite at 1% pulp density for 96 h, shaking\
              \ at 22  C. Mg, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni concentrations were measured from\
              \ leachates every 24 h for 96 h. Error bars indicate standard deviation\
              \ of measurements from duplicate measurements.\\n\\nWhen leaching for\
              \ longer than 24 h, bioleaching efficiency continues to increase (Fig.\
              \ 3). In a 96-hour bioleaching analysis of dunite at 1% pulp density,\
              \ bioleaching increased between 24 and 96 h by an average of 73% for\
              \ Mg, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni (Fig. 3). After 96 h, the leaching of magnesium\
              \ in biolixiviant is 42 times that of water (Fig. 3). This shows that\
              \ biolixiviants from G. oxydans improve the overall leaching of metals\
              \ at a rate faster than water.\\n\\nThe G. oxydans biolixiviant is only\
              \ 6% better than gluconic acid at 1% pulp density\\n\\nFiltering cells\
              \ from the G. oxydans biolixiviant does not notably reduce the bioleaching\
              \ of metals from dunite after 24-hour leaching. We compared Bioleaching\
              \ of 1% dunite by sugar water (col. 1), with whole cell lixiviant (col.\
              \ 2), and with a biolixiviant that was clarified by filtration with\
              \ a 0.22 mum syringe filter (col. 3). Filtered and unfiltered biolixiviants\
              \ were at identical pH, produced from duplicate colonies, and were added\
              \ to ultramafic minerals in identical conditions. Filtering biolixiviants\
              \ before bioleaching resulted in similar metal concentrations when compared\
              \ to whole-cell biolixiviants when leaching dunite. A Welch's two-sample\
              \ t-test shows that no significant difference was detected between the\
              \ unfiltered and filtered groups, with p-values ranging from 0.2 to\
              \ 0.9. This indicates that based on a 24-hour leaching study, the presence\
              \ of G. oxydans does not significantly improve or diminish the effect\
              \ of the biolixiviant on leaching in short term leaching.\\n\\nA secondary\
              \ control was performed using only gluconic acid diluted with deionized\
              \ water to the same pH as the acid biolixiviants produced by G. oxydans.\
              \ Reed et al. and Antonick et al. demonstrated that biolixiviants produced\
              \ by G. oxydans were noticeably more effective at bioleaching than gluconic\
              \ acid alone. However, recent anecdotal evidence suggests this is not\
              \ the case under all conditions. In our hands, when bioleaching ultramafic\
              \ materials at low pulp density (1%), G. oxydans-produced biolixiviants\
              \ only slightly outperform gluconic acid in leaching most metals (Fig.\
              \ 2). Wild-type G. oxydans biolixiviants leached only 6% more magnesium\
              \ compared to pure gluconic acid that was diluted with ultrapure water\
              \ to the same pH after 24 h of leaching. Furthermore, at least with\
              \ low pulp density leaching, filtering cells from the biolixiviant did\
              \ not significantly affect bioleaching, at least under the conditions\
              \ of these tests (Fig. 4). This was done to assess if there was a significant\
              \ residual effect of microbial activity on leaching after biolixiviant\
              \ production. Furthermore, stoppering flasks during leaching to prevent\
              \ gas exchange did not significantly affect bioleaching (Figure S5).\
              \ Later in the article, we ask if there are conditions under which the\
              \ G. oxydans biolixiviant has a significant performance advantage for\
              \ bioleaching ultramafic materials.\\n\\nCellulosic hydrolysate can\
              \ be used as an alternative sugar feedstock for bioleaching\\n\\nTechno-economic\
              \ analysis shows that glucose feedstock for biolixiviant production\
              \ is the biggest cost driver in REE biomining with G. oxydans, accounting\
              \ for almost half of the total cost. Furthermore, the sheer scale that\
              \ carbon sequestration needs to operate at, means that enormous amounts\
              \ of feedstock will be required, potentially placing a significant demand\
              \ on the world's biomass supply.\\n\\nLignocellulose, found in agricultural\
              \ waste, can be a renewable carbon source for microbial growth and production\
              \ once monomeric sugars are released through acid pretreatment and enzymatic\
              \ hydrolysis, making a glucose-rich cellulosic hydrolysate. Lignocellulosic\
              \ sugars are being increasingly investigated as a potential alternative\
              \ sugar source for several applications, including biofuels/bioethanol\
              \ production and substrates for cellular production. Utilizing lignocellulose-derived\
              \ sugars could serve as a high glucose replacement feedstock that would\
              \ greatly improve the cost-efficiency of bioleaching for carbon capture\
              \ technologies. G. oxydans has been shown to be able to convert the\
              \ glucose and xylose sugars in cellulosic hydrolysate into gluconic\
              \ acid and xylonic acid at extremely high efficiencies. Replacing pure\
              \ glucose with cellulosic hydrolysate could further improve the economic\
              \ and environmental viability of bio-accelerated weathering.\\n\\nG.\
              \ oxydans has been shown to efficiently produce gluconic acid and xylonic\
              \ acid from lignocellulosic hydrolysate feedstocks, making industrial-scale,\
              \ bio-accelerated carbon mineralization far more economically feasible.\
              \ We investigated if biolixiviants produced from cellulosic hydrolysate,\
              \ rather than pure glucose, could be effective at leaching dunite. The\
              \ cellulosic hydrolysate (CH) used in this study is a glucose-rich solution\
              \ produced from the enzymatic hydrolysis of concentrated corn stover\
              \ (Table S3).\\n\\nUse of cellulosic hydrolysate as a biolixiviant feedstock\
              \ does not considerably reduce bioleaching efficiency. Panels (A) to\
              \ (E) show comparison of bioleaching of Mg, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni by Gluconobacter\
              \ oxydans when using glucose and cellulosic hydrolysate (CH) as as biolixiviant\

              n\\nBiolixiviants produced from cellulosic hydrolysate were on average\
              \ 28% less effective in leaching magnesium compared to glucose-based\
              \ biolixiviants (Fig. 5). Leaching of Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni was also reduced\
              \ by an average of 52% compared to glucose-based biolixiviants (Fig.\
              \ 5). Dunite was added at 1% pulp density, and a leaching comparison\
              \ between CH-based and glucose-based lixiviants was conducted in parallel\
              \ and in identical conditions. The cellulosic hydrolysate added was\
              \ diluted with deionized water so that the total sugar concentrations\
              \ were equal to the amount of glucose added for glucose-based biolixiviants.\\\
              n\\nDespite a 28% average reduction in Mg leaching, we were unable to\
              \ detect a statistically meaningful difference between glucose- and\
              \ CH-based leaching of Mg using a Welch's two-sample t-test. This was\
              \ due to the small sample size and variability in CH-based biolixiviant\
              \ leachate measurements. Data collected for CH-based biolixiviants resulted\
              \ in greater variability than data with glucose-based biolixiviants.\
              \ ICP-MS analysis of cellulosic hydrolysate samples showed that the\
              \ CH used in this study contains trace concentrations of metals, possibly\
              \ as a result of the manufacturing process (Table S4). When calculating\
              \ the amounts of metal leached from CH-based biolixiviants, the concentrations\
              \ of metal in a cellulosic hydrolysate control study were subtracted\
              \ from the total detected to eliminate metal concentrations that were\
              \ not extracted from dunite. In low pulp density studies, the concentrations\
              \ of metals in the cellulosic hydrolysate feedstock interfered with\
              \ metals leached, resulting in higher overall error.\\n\\nCellulosic\
              \ hydrolysate produced from corn stover contains several toxins such\
              \ as organic acids, furan derivatives, and phenolic compounds that could\
              \ inhibit the growth of G. oxydans and its production of biolixiviant.\
              \ Cellulosic hydrolysate also significantly increases viscosity, resulting\
              \ in lower oxygen transfer rates that limit the fermentation of glucose\
              \ to gluconic acid. Despite this, leaching results show that G. oxydans\
              \ can produce a biolixiviant from cellulosic hydrolysate capable of\
              \ leaching metals at concentrations significantly greater than controls;\
              \ however, further analysis and experimentation are needed to show if\
              \ CH can be a viable replacement to glucose without a significant reduction\
              \ in performance.\\n\\nAlthough cellulosic hydrolysate contains mild\
              \ antibiotic properties due to its acidity and certain toxic compounds,\
              \ this could be advantageous for the industrial scale use of it as a\
              \ feedstock for biolixiviant production. G. oxydans has high acid resistance\
              \ and is capable of growing and producing biolixiviant with cellulosic\
              \ hydrolysate, while many other microbes have low tolerance mechanisms\
              \ for it. This could allow for cellulosic hydrolysate to be used as\
              \ an ultra-low-cost feedstock while also preventing the growth of competing\
              \ microbes. The toxic components of cellulosic hydrolysate could also\
              \ be a genetic engineering target for G. oxydans, where mutants that\
              \ have better resistance mechanisms can be selected for to improve biolixiviant\
              \ production.\\n\\nG. oxydans mutant strain DeltapstS, P112:mgdh improved\
              \ magnesium leaching by 12% over wild-type\\n\\nA preliminary study\
              \ using the mutant strain G. oxydans DeltapstS, P112:mgdh shows that\
              \ under identical growth and leaching conditions, mutant strains of\
              \ G. oxydans can be more effective than wild-type in leaching magnesium\
              \ and energy-critical metals from dunite.\\n\\nA bioleaching analysis\
              \ over 96 h using dunite at 1% pulp density was conducted with biolixiviant\
              \ from wild-type and mutant G. oxydans. Bioleachate samples were taken\
              \ and analyzed every 24 h up to 96 h using ICP-MS. The strain used is\
              \ G. oxydans DeltapstS, P112:mgdh, which was engineered to improve acid\
              \ production for metal leaching. It contains a clean deletion of the\
              \ pstS gene which is involved in phosphate signaling and transport,\
              \ and an up-regulation with promoter P112 of the mgdh gene (Membrane-bound\
              \ Glucose DeHydrogenase) which is critical for converting glucose into\
              \ gluconic acid. The DeltapstS, P112:mgdh mutant was previously shown\
              \ to decrease the pH of biolixiviants compared to wild-type, and it\
              \ increases the overall leaching of REE. The biolixiviant produced from\
              \ the DeltapstS, P112:mgdh mutant had a pH of 2.01 +- 0.02 across all\
              \ replicates, while the pH of wild-type biolixiviants were 2.39 +- 0.02.\\\
              n\\nBioleaching efficiency of magnesium increased by an average of 12%\
              \ when leaching with a high performing G. oxydans mutant. The G. oxydans\
              \ mutant contains a deletion of pstS phosphate signaling and transport\
              \ gene, alongside up-regulation of the mgdh gene that codes for the\
              \ Membrane-bound Glucose DeHydrogenase (MGDH) with the P112 promoter\
              \ (G. oxydans DeltapstS, P112:mdgh). Leaching was done with dunite at\
              \ 1% pulp density shaking at 22  C over 96 h. Stars and dots denote\

              \ (***).\\n\\nThe analysis shows that DeltapstS, P112:mgdh mutant biolixiviant\
              \ increases magnesium leaching by an average of 12% over all samples\
              \ taken between 24 and 96 h of leaching. Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni had an average\
              \ improvement in leaching of 12% using mutant biolixiviant compared\
              \ to wild-type (Fig. 6).\\n\\nThe entire genome of G. oxydans is yet\
              \ to be completely characterized, and several other genes may exist\
              \ that are critical in controlling metal leaching from ultramafic rocks.\
              \ Future work to characterize the genome of G. oxydans in terms of its\
              \ functions related to ultramafic leaching is vital to engineer better\
              \ mutant strains that can improve the performance of bio-accelerated\
              \ weathering. The DeltapstS, P112:mgdh mutant is engineered to maximize\
              \ gluconic acid production; however, studies have shown that for rare\
              \ earths leaching, G. oxydans mutants can be screened to identify genes\
              \ that specifically affect rare earth extraction. Our research group\
              \ has created a quality-controlled (QC) whole genome knockout collection\
              \ for G. oxydans B58, containing a collection of 2,733 transposon disruption\
              \ mutants, each with a different nonessential gene disrupted. This QC\
              \ collection enables a high-throughput screen of the G. oxydans genome,\
              \ selecting for significant changes to dunite leaching efficacy. This\

              nG. oxydans biolixiviants are 3.2x more effective than gluconic acid\

              \ biolixiviant was 3.2x more effective at bioleaching dunite than gluconic\
              \ acid diluted to the same pH with pure water. A comparative bioleaching\
              \ study was conducted comparing the leaching efficacy of wild-type G.\
              \ oxydans biolixiviants and just gluconic acid at the same pH. Magnesium\

              \ leaching with 5% (A), 10% (B), and 60% (C) dunite (DUN-2). At higher\
              \ dunite pulp densities, the improvement of Gluconobacter oxydans biolixiviants\
              \ compared to gluconic acid was amplified. After 72 h, biolixiviants\
              \ were 74% better than gluconic acid at leaching 5% dunite, 1.87 times\
              \ better at leaching 10% dunite, and 2.25 times better at leaching 60%\

              nAt higher pulp densities and longer leaching times, Gluconobacter oxydans\
              \ biolixiviants significantly outperformed gluconic acid at the same\
              \ pH. We compared Gluconobacter oxydans biolixiviants and gluconic acid\
              \ metal leaching with 5%, 10%, and 60% dunite pulp density, where leachate\
              \ metal concentrations were measured every 24 h for 72 h. The gluconic\
              \ acid was diluted with ultrapure deionized water to match the pH of\
              \ biolixiviants, and leaching was performed in identical conditions\
              \ with the same mineral substrates (DUN-2). After 72 h of leaching,\
              \ wild-type biolixiviants leached 1.74 times more magnesium than gluconic\
              \ acid from 5% dunite, 2.87 times more from 10% dunite, and 3.25 times\
              \ more from 60% dunite (Fig. 7). At higher pulp densities, Gluconobacter\
              \ oxydans biolixiviants exhibit significantly higher leaching efficiency\
              \ than gluconic acid. This analysis suggests that metal leaching from\
              \ dunite is not only controlled by acidolysis, but might contain other\
              \ biologically-synthesized components that amplify extraction.\\n\\\
              nMagnesium leaching relative to glucose input can be greatly improved\

              \ factor in utilizing G. oxydans biolixiviant as a weathering accelerant.\
              \ Furthermore, the sheer scale at which carbon sequestration must operate\
              \ requires enormous amounts of microbial feedstock, possibly enough\
              \ to make a significant demand on the world's biomass supply. Therefore,\
              \ it is essential to prioritize maximizing carbon dioxide sequestration\
              \ while minimizing feedstock consumption in order to mitigate the strain\
              \ on worldwide biomass resources.\\n\\nWe define the carbon investment\
              \ to carbon sequestration ratio, kseq, as the number of carbon atoms\
              \ in the feedstock (e.g., glucose) needed to liberate one magnesium\
              \ ion (and hence sequester the single atom of carbon in a CO2 molecule,\\\
              n\\nLower kseq values indicate that more magnesium was leached given\
              \ a certain glucose input, while high kseq values indicate relatively\
              \ lower magnesium leaching for the same amount of feedstock consumed.\
              \ A kseq value of 6 for a glucose feedstock means that one glucose molecule\
              \ is necessary to liberate one magnesium ion (which has the potential\
              \ to sequester 1 CO2). A kseq value of 1 means that a minimum of one\
              \ feedstock carbon atom is needed to eventually sequester one CO2 molecule.\
              \ The statement that each liberated magnesium ion results in one CO2\
              \ molecule sequestered assumes a 100% carbonation rate in a future downstream\
              \ process that converts magnesium in leachate into magnesite. kseq only\
              \ illustrates the lower limit of sugar input necessary to sequester\
              \ CO2.\\n\\nWe can use kseq to estimate the lower limit price of carbon\
              \ sequestration and the total amount of feedstock needed to sequester\
              \ a useful amount of CO2 (e.g., 20 gigatonnes of CO2 per year). The\

              \  is the molecular weight of CO2, and nC, feedstock is the average\
              \ number of carbon atoms in each molecule of the feedstock. Likewise,\

              \ the price per unit mass of the feedstock.\\n\\nProcess and genetic\
              \ improvements reduce the amount of feedstock carbon needed to potentially\
              \ sequester one CO2 molecule from 525 to 1. Increasing leaching time,\
              \ pulp density, and reducing average particle sizes were able to reduce\
              \ kseq (glucose carbon investment vs. carbon sequestration ratio) by\
              \ several orders of magnitude. Increasing dunite pulp density from 1-10%\
              \ had a larger impact in reducing kseq than increasing leaching time\
              \ from 1 to 10 days. Combining the DeltapstS, P112:mdgh double mutant\
              \ with high pulp densities and long leaching times resulted in a kseq\
              \ value of 1 in three experiments (Col. 10-12). Leaching attempts #1-9\
              \ used DUN-1 and attempts #10-12 used DUN-3 with a particle size of\
              \ less than 74 microns as the leaching substrate.\\n\\nIn this work,\
              \ we succeeded in reducing kseq from 525 to 1.0 (almost 3 orders of\
              \ magnitude) (Fig. 8). With 1% dunite and 24 h of leaching, the approximate\
              \ kseq is 525 carbon invested/magnesium leached. One method to reduce\
              \ kseq is to increase the time of leaching. After 96 h of leaching,\
              \ the magnesium concentration increased by 81% when compared to 24 h\
              \ leaching at the same pulp density (Fig. 3). When increasing the time\
              \ of leaching to 10 days, the magnesium concentration improved by an\
              \ average of 147% (Fig. 8). Increasing the pulp density of dunite also\
              \ reduces kseq. When compared to 1% pulp density of dunite, increasing\
              \ to 10% pulp density resulted in a 5-fold increase in magnesium leaching\
              \ after 24 h (Fig. 8). When combining 10% pulp density with 10 days\
              \ of leaching, magnesium leaching increased by 9.2 times that of 1%\
              \ pulp density leached for 1 day (Fig. 8), resulting in a kseq of 57,\
              \ since glucose input remained unchanged. For the lowest kseq values\
              \ achieved, fine-particle dunite at a pulp density of 60% was leached\
              \ for 19 days with three different methods (Fig. 8 Leaching Attempts\
              \ #12-14). The first method (Fig. 8 Leaching Attempt #12) was direct\
              \ addition of 60% dunite, the second method (Leaching Attempt #13) was\
              \ a 2-step dunite addition, where 30% dunite was added on day 0 and\
              \ another 30% added on day 10, and the third method (Leaching Attempt\
              \ #14) was a 2-step dunite addition where the first 30% dunite feed\
              \ was removed from the leachate before the second 30% addition on day\
              \ 10. All three leaching methods resulted in a kseq equal to or less\
              \ than 1.0, with the lowest kseq being 0.96 on Leaching Attempt #13\
              \ in Fig. 8.\\n\\nWhat implications do these results have for CO2 sequestration?\
              \ For kseq = 525, when using glucose as a feedstock, the cost of sequestering\
              \ 1 tonne of CO2 is $358,000, a long way above the US Department of\
              \ Energy's (DOE) target of $100 per tonne, and well above existing technologies.\
              \ On the other hand, if we could reduce kseq to 1 (as in Fig. 8) at\
              \ industrial scale, the cost of carbon sequestration (at least the microbial\
              \ feedstock part of the cost) through bio-accelerated weathering starts\
              \ to become comparable to (still high) current technologies, at $682\
              \ per tonne. If we could reduce kseq to 0.15 (about a 6-fold reduction\
              \ over our best attempt, much smaller than the reduction we achieved\
              \ in the course of writing this article) then we could reduce the feedstock\
              \ cost for sequestering 1 tonne of CO2 to $100. This would not account\
              \ for the costs of mining ultramafic material, but nor does it account\
              \ for the offset cost of energy-critical metal recovery. However, using\
              \ this to sequester 20 gigatonnes of CO2 a year would require 2 billion\
              \ tonnes of glucose, over 10 times current global annual sugar production.\\\
              n\\nSugars derived from cellulosic biomass are potentially much more\
              \ abundant than glucose that is derived from cereal crops like corn,\
              \ sugar cane, and sugar beet. While there is no widespread production\
              \ of cellulosic sugars today that is not immediately diverted to cellulosic\
              \ ethanol production, this could happen in the future. Furthermore,\
              \ it is estimated that cellulosic sugar production could be as low as\
              \ $100 per tonne (in contrast to around $1,000 per tonne for glucose).\
              \ Although cellulosic sugars are abundant, they are not limitless. Slade\
              \ et al., made estimates of global bioenergy supply, and concluded that\
              \ several tipping points would occur as the amount of biomass withdrawn\
              \ from the biosphere for bioenergy (or some other chemical production,\
              \ such as carbon sequestration) increased, forcing increasingly unpalatable\
              \ choices on global society including mass adoption of vegetarian diets,\
              \ mass deforestation, population control, or combinations thereof. Their\
              \ analysis suggests that the first global agricultural tipping point\
              \ (choosing one of the three unpalatable options) would occur when biomass\
              \ was withdrawn at a rate of around 7 gigatonnes per year. Assuming\
              \ that cellulosic sugars are on average a 50:50 mix of C5 and C6 sugars,\
              \ then to reduce the cellulosic biomass demand to sequester 20 gigatonnes\
              \ of CO2 to 3.5 gigatonnes, kseq needs only to be reduced to 0.25.\\\
              n\\nAlthough kseq serves as a useful metric for displaying sugar investment\
              \ in terms of CO2 sequestration potential, it is only a theoretical\
              \ value whose real value will depend on the conversion rates of downstream\
              \ CO2 mineralization. Since glucose inputs are a major cost driver in\
              \ bio-accelerated weathering, kseq can help estimate lower-limit costs\
              \ of scaled operations. Future scale-up work will be necessary to formulate\
              \ more accurate estimates of cost before they can be compared with other\
              \ direct CO2 mineralization technologies.\\n\\nPossibilities for downstream\
              \ carbon mineralization\\n\\nOn its own, G. oxydans bioleachate saturated\
              \ with magnesium ions will be difficult to convert into stable carbonate\
              \ minerals. Due to the nature of acid leaching, the final pH of biolixiviants\
              \ post-leaching tended to be low (4-5) in our experiments, making carbon\
              \ mineralization chemically unfavorable. Since pH has a significant\
              \ influence on the precipitation of carbonates due to the lower availability\
              \ of carbonate ions in acidic conditions, pH adjustments are required\
              \ to increase carbonate mineral yields downstream. Increasing the concentration\
              \ of gaseous CO2 injected or sparged through the leachate increases\
              \ the total dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC); however, this reduces\
              \ the pH of the leachate, reducing carbonate ion availability and decreasing\
              \ the saturation index of carbonate minerals.\\n\\nA possible downstream\
              \ pathway to adjust the pH of leachates to make carbon dioxide complexation\
              \ chemically favorable is to add ammonia from biological or natural\
              \ sources to synthesize magnesite, MgCO3, or nesquehonite, MgCO3 3H2O.\
              \ Adding ammonia to CO2-sparged magnesium chloride solutions at ambient\
              \ temperatures was shown to completely convert free magnesium ions into\
              \ nesquehonite in about ten minutes. Furthermore, ammonia can be recycled\
              \ in this process through recovery of ammonia using activated carbon,\
              \ which has been shown to recover ammonium chloride salts and separate\
              \ them into ammonia and hydrochloric acid at near ambient conditions.\
              \ Another possibility is to simply add sodium hydroxide that has been\
              \ electrically synthesized from carbon-neutral pathways.\\n\\nMicrobes\
              \ that accelerate carbon mineralization, such as cyanobacteria, have\
              \ been observed to accelerate mineralization in legacy alkaline mine\
              \ tailings. Coupling bio-accelerated weathering from Gluconobacter oxydans\
              \ with biotic downstream processes could maximize carbonate precipitation\
              \ in a low-resource and energy-efficient process that could be genetically\
              \ engineered further.\\n\\nScale-Up and future steps\\n\\nIn order to\
              \ show that bio-accelerated weathering is a feasible option for gigatonne-scale\
              \ CO2 sequestration, future work will be required to show that a scaled-up\
              \ bioprocess is possible without a significant reduction in efficiency\
              \ compared to the bench-scale experiments shown here.\\n\\nBench-scale\
              \ lab results rarely have equal yields and efficiencies when scaled\
              \ up to pilot- or industrial-scale bioprocesses. Being an obligate aerobe,\
              \ G. oxydans requires air exchange and consistent mixing for optimal\
              \ growth. Furthermore, optimized mixing of the mineral substrate with\
              \ biolixiviants, rate of glucose supplementation, rate of mineral addition,\
              \ and optimized particle sizes for leaching are yet to be thoroughly\
              \ investigated. To address these scale-up challenges, all process parameters\
              \ will need to be investigated in bioreactor experiments.\\n\\nAnother\
              \ consideration is how cell viability changes throughout the leaching\
              \ process. G. oxydans has been shown to be resilient in high metal concentrations,\
              \ unlike several other microbes. However, having high pulp densities\
              \ of dunite would be a growth challenge for G. oxydans. Despite this,\
              \ cell viability during leaching may not be a critical parameter for\
              \ the effectiveness of leaching by G. oxydans biolixiviants. For short\
              \ term leaching, it is shown that having cells present in the biolixiviant\
              \ has an insignificant effect on leaching (Fig. 4). Since biolixiviants\
              \ are produced in an independent step before leaching begins (Figure\
              \ S1), it is not essential to have live cells present during leaching.\
              \ However, possible direct microbe-mineral interactions and continued\
              \ acid production may have an effect on long-term leaching and scaled\
              \ processes.\\n\\nOvercoming the deceleration of leaching over time\
              \ is also a future scale-up challenge to address. The rates of leaching\
              \ were shown to slow down over the 96 h they were monitored (Fig. 3).\
              \ As ultramafic minerals are dissolved by biolixiviants, passivation\
              \ layers can form from amorphous silica (Note S1) or other mineral byproducts.\
              \ Furthermore, as the solution nears saturation of metal cations, dissolution\
              \ rates are expected to stagnate. Future investigations into overcoming\
              \ the passivation layers and developing integrated mineralization technologies\
              \ to allow for continuous leaching will be necessary for scale-up.\\\
              n\\nUtilizing lignocellulosic-based sugars as an alternative sugar feedstock\
              \ also poses a challenge in scale-up. Although G. oxydans has been shown\
              \ to effectively produce biolixiviants from cellulosic hydrolysate,\
              \ the state of lignocellulosic sugar production is underdeveloped. Large-scale\
              \ production of sugars derived from second-generation biomass (lignocellulose)\
              \ is still limited, and developments in improving efficiency and yield\
              \ are ongoing. Advances in the supply chain of lignocellulosic biomass\
              \ and optimization in pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis will be\
              \ necessary in the near future for the large-scale implementation of\
              \ lignocellulosic-based sugars for bio-accelerated weathering.\\n\\\
              nConclusion\\n\\nThis article shows that G. oxydans possesses the capability\
              \ to bioleach metals for energy technologies and carbon mineralization\
              \ from dunite. At low pulp densities (1%), the G. oxydans organic acid-based\
              \ biolixiviant is 20x more effective at Mg leaching than deionized water.\
              \ At high pulp densities (60%), the biolixiviant is 3.2x better than\
              \ even gluconic acid alone. This suggests that microbially-accelerated\
              \ weathering of ultramafic materials could be an environmentally-friendly\
              \ method for supplying Mg for mineralization of CO2, and metals like\
              \ Ni and Co for sustainable energy technologies at rates that can far\
              \ exceed equivalent abiotic methods.\\n\\nSeveral pH swing methods have\
              \ been shown to be highly effective for greatly accelerating olivine\
              \ carbonation. However, scaling up these technologies to meet the world's\
              \ CO2 removal requirements may involve high energy costs and environmental\
              \ drawbacks like those found in strong acid leaching involved with large\
              \ scale energy-critical metal mining. Other methods of accelerated weathering\
              \ involving energy-intensive preprocessing of mineral feedstocks by\
              \ crushing, grinding, and chemically treating ultramafic rocks also\
              \ come with their own environmental and scaling drawbacks. In situ accelerated\
              \ ultramafic weathering can result in environmental leaching and environmental\
              \ drainage of harmful doses of nickel, chromium, and cobalt. These methods\
              \ also involve slow kinetics that depend on high energy inputs to be\
              \ accelerated and enormous land use.\\n\\nBio-accelerated weathering\
              \ may be an alternative approach to mineral weathering for carbon mineralization.\
              \ When engineered further, this strategy may prove an economically-viable\
              \ and scalable option that avoids the environmental concerns with in\
              \ situ mechanically-accelerated weathering and strong acid leaching,\
              \ as well as the energy costs involved in high temperature and pressure\
              \ reactions. Energy requirements for heating in common abiotic carbonation\
              \ processes, such as ammonium salts-driven pH swings and HCl pH swings,\
              \ often result in CO2 emissions greater than the amount sequestered.\
              \ G. oxydans-based bioleaching was shown to be effective at ambient\
              \ temperature and pressure, removing a major energy burden for this\
              \ process.\\n\\nIn this article, we were able to reduce the number of\
              \ carbon atoms in glucose needed to sequester one molecule of CO2 from\
              \ 525 to 1. However, further work needs to be done to optimize G. oxydans\
              \ for enhanced weathering for carbon mineralization. Maximizing the\
              \ leaching of magnesium while minimizing carbon inputs and lowering\
              \ the economic costs are key steps to making this technology viable\
              \ for eliminating the several gigatonnes of carbon dioxide in excess\
              \ on our planet.\\n\\nMaterials and methods\\n\\nUltramafic samples\
              \ were collected from the Day Brook Dunite (35  58' 0.45\\\" N, 82 \
              \ 16' 58.60\\\" W) in western North Carolina. The chemically weathered\
              \ exterior of the dunite was removed using a tile saw (151991, MK Diamond\
              \ Products, Inc., Torrance, CA). The trimmed interior was crushed into\
              \ powder using a SPEX SamplePrep 8000M mill and a tungsten carbide vial.\
              \ Before bioleaching experiments, the mineralogy of powder from two\
              \ samples was analyzed via x-ray diffraction (XRD) with a Bruker D8\
              \ Advance ECO powder diffractometer at Cornell Center for Materials\
              \ Research (CCMR). The instrument is equipped with a Copper K-alpha\
              \ X-ray source. Analyses were made at 5 to 60 degrees, with an increment\
              \ of 0.019 degrees and a dwell time of 0.3 seconds per step. To mitigate\
              \ Fe fluorescence the detector's lower discriminator was raised from\
              \ 0.110 V to 0.182 V. XRD shows that sample DUN-1 consists of 64 wt.\
              \ % olivine, 27 wt. % lizardite, 5 wt. % antigorite, and 4 wt. % talc.\
              \ Sample DUN-2 contains 37 wt. % olivine, 59 wt. % lizardite, 2 wt.\
              \ % talc, and 2 wt. % meixnerite. Sample DUN-3 contains 92 wt. % olivine,\
              \ 5 wt. % antigorite, 2 wt. % lizardite, and 1 wt. % talc. Major and\
              \ trace element compositions of the bulk rock were determined at the\
              \ Hamilton Analytical Laboratory in Clinton, NY via XRF and LA-ICPMS\
              \ and are shown in Tables S1 and S2.\\n\\nThree separate dunite samples\
              \ were used in bioleaching studies. DUN-1 was used in the leaching studies\
              \ shown in Figures 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and Supplementary Figures S4 and S5.\
              \ Due to the depletion of DUN-1 in previous experiments, DUN-2 was used\
              \ to produce the data used in Figure 7. DUN-3 was used in Leaching Attempts\
              \ #10 and #12-14 in Figure 8 and Supplementary Figure S3.\\n\\nMicroorganisms\
              \ and media\\n\\nGluconobacter oxydans strain NRRL B-58 (GoB58) was\
              \ obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATTC), Manassas,\
              \ VA. In all experiments, GoB58 was cultured in Yeast-Peptone-Mannitol\
              \ media (YPM; 5 g L-1 yeast extract (C7341, Hardy Diagnostics, Santa\
              \ Maria, CA), 3 g L-1 peptone (211677, BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ), 25 g\
              \ L-1 mannitol (BDH9248, VWR Chemicals, Radnor, PA)).\\n\\nGluconobacter\
              \ oxydans mutant strain DeltapstS, P112:mdgh contains a clean deletion\
              \ of the gene encoding the periplasmic phosphate-binding protein, PstS,\
              \ and an up-regulation of the membrane-bound glucose dehydrogenase gene\
              \ with promoter P112. This mutant strain was previously constructed\
              \ by Schmitz et al..\\n\\nGrowth and organic acid production\\n\\nGoB58\
              \ was inoculated into YPM liquid culture then incubated for 24 h at\
              \ 30  C and 200 rpm in a shaking incubator (Infors HT Multitron). Cultures\
              \ were then back-diluted to OD590 of 0.05 in a total volume of 25 mL\
              \ YPM in 50 mL flasks. The flasks were then incubated at 30  C and 200\
              \ rpm until the OD590 reaches approximately 1.5 after about 48 h. Cultures\
              \ were then split into 7.5 mL triplicates with 7.5 mL of 40% glucose\
              \ added to each triplicate, for a total volume of 15 mL. The glucose\
              \ and bacterial mixture was then incubated for 48 h at 30  C and 200\
              \ rpm, starting biolixiviant production. After 48 h, the pH of each\
              \ flask is measured (VWR Symphony B10P.).\\n\\nCellulosic hydrolysate\
              \ (National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Golden, CO) was used in some\
              \ leaching studies as an alternative glucose feedstock. In experiments\
              \ using cellulosic hydrolysate, it was diluted to 80% concentration\
              \ so that the total sugar concentrations (Table S2) would be equal to\
              \ 40%. Then 7.5 mL of 80% cellulosic hydrolysate was added in replacement\
              \ of 7.5 mL of 40% glucose.\\n\\nBioleaching studies\\n\\nBioleaching\
              \ experiments were conducted with dunite at a pulp density of 1-10%\
              \ wt/vol, as specified. Minerals were added to 15 mL of biolixiviant,\
              \ then agitated at room temperature in a shaking incubator for 24 h.\
              \ After 24 h, the ultramafic rock and biolixiviant slurry was centrifuged\
              \ and the bioleachate was extracted for ICP-MS analysis.\\n\\nAnalytical\
              \ methods\\n\\nLeachates from bioleaching experiments were filtered\
              \ through a 0.45 mum AcroPrep Advance 96-well filter plate (8029, Pall\
              \ Corporation, Show Low, AZ, USA) by centrifugation at 1,500 x g for\
              \ 5 min, then diluted to 1% with 2% trace metal grade nitric acid (JT9368,\
              \ J.T. Baker, Radnor, Pennsylvania, USA). Samples were analyzed with\
              \ an Agilent 7800 ICP-MS. The concentrations of metals were measured\
              \ against a custom ICP-MS standard solution containing 10 mg/L of Al,\
              \ As, B, Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Mo, Na, Ni, P, Pb, S, Sb,\
              \ Se, Si, Sn, and Zn (High Purity Standards, North Charleston, SC) and\
              \ an ICP-MS internal standard (5188-6525, Agilent Technologies, Santa\
              \ Clara, CA). Quality checks were done with intermittent standards and\
              \ blanks as specified in the ICP-MS guidelines and protocols.\\n\\nLimitations\
              \ of the study\\n\\nThis study was designed to establish a baseline\
              \ understanding of ultramafic rock leaching by G. oxydans. The starting\
              \ ultramafic rocks were chosen due to their high olivine/forsterite\
              \ content and low complexity (lower content of other minerals). More\
              \ industrially-applicable and abundant starting materials, such as lower\
              \ olivine-containing forms of dunite, ultramafic mine tailings, and\
              \ highly serpentinized ultramafic rocks will be investigated in future\
              \ studies.\\n\\nThis study only observes G. oxydans leaching over short\
              \ periods at relatively low pulp densities. While some experiments did\
              \ include high pulp densities for long periods (Fig. 8), a rigorous\
              \ examination of how leaching evolves over long periods was not conducted.\

        n\\nThe accumulation of over a trillion tonnes of anthropogenic CO2 in the\
        \ Earth's atmosphere driving global climate change is one of the most pressing\
        \ challenges of our time. To address this, the IPCC's Special Report in 2018\
        \ stresses the necessity of deploying carbon dioxide removal (CDR) technology\
        \ capable of removing tens of gigatonnes of CO2 from the atmosphere annually,\
        \ paired with carbon-neutral energy technologies to prevent global warming\
        \ from exceeding 1.5 C above pre-industrial levels.\\n\\nProposed system for\
        \ bio-accelerated weathering of ultramafic materials for carbon mineralization.\
        \ This work focuses on the rate-limiting step, the metal leaching stage (enclosed\
        \ in red box), where G. oxydans biolixiviant leaches magnesium ions and other\
        \ metals from dunite. Downstream carbonation results in magnesite formation\
        \ for CO2 storage, and metal recovery done chemically or electrochemically\
        \ can extract energy-critical metals for commercial use.\\n\\nMineralization\
        \ of CO2 is a highly attractive approach for permanent sequestration of CO2,\
        \ as it converts atmospheric carbon into solid minerals as a permanent sink.\
        \ Carbon mineralization proceeds through a two-step process. First, ultramafic\
        \ rocks are dissolved by weathering to release magnesium cations (Note S1).\
        \ In the second step, magnesium ions are reacted with dissolved carbonate\
        \ to form magnesite (MgCO3), a stable mineral that permanently stores CO2\
        \ (Note S1). A schematic of a proposed indirect carbonation method is shown\
        \ in Fig. 1.\\n\\nNaturally occurring weathering of ultramafic rocks and subsequent\
        \ carbon mineralization is thought to be responsible for removal of up to\
        \ hundreds of millions of tonnes of CO2 each year. In fact, because ultramafic\
        \ rocks are so abundant, reaction of all of the metal cations in all surface-accessible\
        \ ultramafic material could capture 100 trillion tonnes of CO2 as carbonate\
        \ minerals (at least 58x the excess CO2 in the atmosphere), making them a\
        \ strong candidate for gigatonne-scale CDR. However, natural carbon mineralization\
        \ is partially offset by oxidation of rock organic carbon. As a result, the\
        \ time to naturally regulate atmospheric CO2 levels is estimated to be between\
        \ tens and hundreds of thousands of years.\\n\\nThe large-scale deployment\
        \ of carbon-neutral energy technologies will also be necessary to control\
        \ climate change, but it will require vast quantities of metals. In addition\
        \ to metal cations needed for CO2 sequestration, ultramafic minerals are a\
        \ potential low-grade ore source for energy-critical metals such as nickel\
        \ (batteries and stainless steel), chromium (concentrated solar and geothermal\
        \ energy), manganese (steel and batteries), cobalt (batteries), and copper\
        \ (wiring and wind turbines) (Figure S2, Tables S1 and S2). This presents\
        \ an opportunity to extract energy-critical metals from ultramafic rock while\
        \ sequestering CO2.\\n\\nHowever, extracting metals from ultramafic rocks\
        \ poses a significant challenge. In aqueous mineral carbonation, the rate\
        \ of carbon mineralization is limited by the slow kinetics of the leaching\
        \ of metal ions from ultramafic sources. While mechanical acceleration of\
        \ ultramafic weathering through crushing, grinding, heating, chemically treating,\
        \ and spreading over land is promising for its high sequestration potential\
        \ and improved kinetics, it requires large area footprints and high energy\
        \ inputs involved in crushing, grinding, heating, and pressurizing, making\
        \ it prohibitively expensive. Likewise, technologies to extract the energy-critical\
        \ elements present in low concentration in ultramafic rocks present formidable\
        \ economic and environmental challenges.\\n\\nWe hypothesize that microbially-accelerated\
        \ mineral dissolution could overcome the slow kinetics and high costs of the\
        \ dissolution of ultramafic material, releasing magnesium ions at a rate several\
        \ orders of magnitude greater than in nature. Over the past two decades, microbial\
        \ mineral dissolution has revolutionized mining copper and gold from low-grade\
        \ ores:a process known as biomining. Bacteria such as Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans\
        \ and related species are responsible for producing about 15% of the world's\
        \ copper supply and about 5% of its gold supply through iron-redox-mediated\
        \ bioleaching, a process in which microbes alter the redox state of metals\
        \ to extract them from mineral substrates. Significant research has been performed\
        \ to improve industrial-scale Cu bioleaching with consortia including A. ferrooxidans\
        \ and non-domesticated microbes, resulting in processes that are fairly mature.\
        \ While copper biomining is the only industrialized biomining process, organisms\
        \ and processes are in development for rare earth elements (REE) and lithium.\\\
        n\\nBiolixiviants produced by Gluconobacter oxydans are a strong candidate\
        \ for a sustainable and strong catalyst for CO2 mineralization using ultramafic\
        \ rocks. A recent study from our team comparing the dunite dissolution performance\
        \ of three mineral-dissolving microbes, Gluconobacter oxydans, Sphingomonas\
        \ desiccabilis, and Penicillium simplicissimum, concludes that G. oxydans\
        \ outperformed the other two in the extraction of all metals from dunite.\\\
        n\\nG. oxydans efficiently produces a gluconic acid-based mineral-dissolving\
        \ solution, called a biolixiviant, when glucose is present. Previous studies\
        \ have shown that biolixiviants from G. oxydans can be more effective than\
        \ just gluconic acid at leaching REE. In a recent article, our team identified\
        \ genes that control the effectiveness of the G. oxydans biolixiviant at dissolving\
        \ neodymium phosphate (synthetic monazite) but do not notably change its pH.\
        \ These results suggest that biologically-produced lixiviants could contain\
        \ additional components, such as metal chelators, redox molecules, and flavins\
        \ that improve overall metal leaching at fixed pH, allowing for more efficient\
        \ and low-resource metal leaching. This could avoid the use of strong acids\
        \ that can have harmful environmental effects such as acid mine drainage.\\\
        n\\nSecond, it is suspected that microbes interact with ultramafic materials\
        \ in the wild, accelerating weathering processes. Furthermore, laboratory\
        \ mixed cultures have been shown to dissolve ultramafic material. Meanwhile,\
        \ in two companion articles, we demonstrate that three easily culturable isolated\
        \ species (G. oxydans, Penicillium simplicissimum and Sphingomonas desiccabilis)\
        \ can all accelerate the dissolution of ultramafic material and characterize\
        \ mineral phase transformations due to bioleaching by G. oxydans.\\n\\nHowever,\
        \ there has been little systematic study of microbial dissolution of ultramafic\
        \ minerals. Furthermore, it remains unclear under what conditions a biolixiviant\
        \ could be more effective than just an organic acid and why; could genetic\
        \ engineering improve ultramafic bioleaching; what impact process parameters\
        \ have on biological dissolution of ultramafic materials; the extraction efficiencies\
        \ for energy critical elements; utilization of low-cost feedstock; and the\
        \ carbon source demand of large-scale ultramafic bioleaching. To address these\
        \ knowledge gaps, we provide some of the first systematic observations of\
        \ dissolution of ultramafic minerals by the mineral-dissolving microbe, G.\
        \ oxydans B58.\\n\\nResults and discussion\\n\\nIn this work, we perform a\
        \ study of G. oxydans bioleaching capability on dunite, an ultramafic rock\
        \ composed of greater than 90% olivine (see composition in Figure S2, and\
        \ Tables S1 and S2). For accelerated weathering technologies, olivine-rich\
        \ dunite is the preferred feedstock due to olivine having the highest CO2\
        \ sequestration potential by mass, excellent carbonation kinetics, and high\
        \ abundance.\\n\\nThis study benchmarks the bioleaching efficacy of glucose-based\
        \ and lignocellulosic sugar-based biolixiviants produced by G. oxydans on\
        \ dunite, comparing conditions of whole-cell and filtered (cell-free) biolixiviants,\
        \ varying pulp densities, aerobic and anaerobic conditions, and short-term\
        \ and long-term leaching. This study also investigates how a high-performing\
        \ mutant strain of G. oxydans could improve leaching in ultramafic minerals,\
        \ serving as a preliminary study of how genetic engineering could further\
        \ improve bioleaching for carbon mineralization. We demonstrate that the effectiveness\
        \ advantage of the G. oxydans biolixiviant over gluconic acid alone grows\
        \ with increasing pulp density. Finally, we demonstrate that the number of\
        \ carbon atoms that need to be supplied by sugar feedstocks can be reduced\
        \ to match the number of carbon atoms potentially sequestered as a mineral.\\\
        n\\nG. oxydans biolixiviants accelerate magnesium and energy-critical metal\
        \ leaching by 20x over deionized water after 24 h\\n\\nBiolixiviants from\
        \ wild-type Gluconobacter oxydans effectively leached magnesium from ultramafic\
        \ rocks (Fig. 2A). The efficiency of extraction measures how much of the available\
        \ metal is leached from the mineral, and is calculated from the ratio of metal\
        \ concentrations in the leachate and the original concentration in the source\
        \ multiplied by the pulp density (ratio of solid mass to liquid volume [g/L]),\\\
        n\\nDeionized water is used as a control for these experiments since it estimates\
        \ the improvements made by bio-accelerated leaching to leaching from environmental\
        \ water sources, such as rainwater. In traditional accelerated carbon mineralization\
        \ with ultramafic rocks, crushed rocks are dispersed over land, where water\
        \ from the environment is the solvent for magnesium. Comparing the concentrations\
        \ of magnesium between leaching with biolixiviants and water provides a rough\
        \ estimate for the order of magnitude in which carbon mineralization is accelerated\
        \ by G. oxydans.\\n\\nLeaching dunite at 1% pulp density with wild-type (WT)\
        \ G. oxydans biolixiviant improves leaching of magnesium by 20-fold when compared\
        \ to leaching with deionized water (control). However, the G. oxydans biolixiviant\
        \ is only 6% better than just gluconic acid at the same pH. Bioleaching of\
        \ dunite at 1% pulp density shaking at 22  C for 24 h was performed with wild-type\
        \ G. oxydans biolixiviant, gluconic acid diluted to the same pH with deionized\
        \ water, and a deionized water control. Panels (A) to (E) show leaching concentrations\
        \ and extraction efficiencies of Mg, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni. Wild-type G. oxydans\
        \ biolixiviants slightly improved metal leaching compared to gluconic acid\
        \ across all metals. Stars denote significant difference between gluconic\
        \ acid leaching and wild-type biolixiviant leaching by a Welch's two-sample\
        \ t-test, where, p < 0.05 (*), p < 0.01 (**), p < 0.001 (***).\\n\\nAfter\
        \ 24 h of leaching with dunite at 1% pulp density, magnesium was leached with\
        \ an extraction efficiency of 11% (300 ppm), corresponding to an increase\
        \ of 20x when compared to the deionized water control (Fig. 2A). The pH of\
        \ wild-type biolixiviants was 2.39 +- 0.02 across all experiments using wild-type\
        \ biolixiviants. At the start of each leaching experiment, the initial concentrations\
        \ of all metals in biolixiviants and controls are below detection limits.\
        \ Figure S3 shows how the metal concentrations in controls and G. oxydans\
        \ leachates diverge within the first few hours of leaching, starting with\
        \ initial metal concentrations of zero.\\n\\nBioleaching of metals by G. oxydans\
        \ increases by 73% from 24 to 96 h\\n\\nThe most efficiently extracted metal\
        \ at 24 h was Mn (Fig. 2B), extracting over 15% of Mn from dunite (corresponding\
        \ to a leachate concentration of 1.6 ppm). Fe, Co, and Ni were also leached\
        \ highly, with efficiencies between 11% and 15% (Figs. 2C, D, and E, respectively).\
        \ Al and Cr were also leached, but much less efficiently (Figure S4). Cr was\
        \ the least efficiently extracted metal, with extraction of no more than 0.3%\
        \ under any condition (Figure S4 right column). We speculate that chromium\
        \ is significantly less leached since the chromite inclusions within dunite\
        \ are relatively more stable than olivine and resistant to acid dissolution.\\\
        n\\nIncreasing leaching time to 96 h increases extraction efficiency by an\
        \ average of 73% between 24 and 96 h for Mg, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni. Biolixiviants\
        \ from wild-type G. oxydans leached dunite at 1% pulp density for 96 h, shaking\
        \ at 22  C. Mg, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni concentrations were measured from leachates\
        \ every 24 h for 96 h. Error bars indicate standard deviation of measurements\
        \ from duplicate measurements.\\n\\nWhen leaching for longer than 24 h, bioleaching\
        \ efficiency continues to increase (Fig. 3). In a 96-hour bioleaching analysis\
        \ of dunite at 1% pulp density, bioleaching increased between 24 and 96 h\
        \ by an average of 73% for Mg, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni (Fig. 3). After 96 h, the\
        \ leaching of magnesium in biolixiviant is 42 times that of water (Fig. 3).\
        \ This shows that biolixiviants from G. oxydans improve the overall leaching\
        \ of metals at a rate faster than water.\\n\\nThe G. oxydans biolixiviant\
        \ is only 6% better than gluconic acid at 1% pulp density\\n\\nFiltering cells\
        \ from the G. oxydans biolixiviant does not notably reduce the bioleaching\
        \ of metals from dunite after 24-hour leaching. We compared Bioleaching of\
        \ 1% dunite by sugar water (col. 1), with whole cell lixiviant (col. 2), and\
        \ with a biolixiviant that was clarified by filtration with a 0.22 mum syringe\
        \ filter (col. 3). Filtered and unfiltered biolixiviants were at identical\
        \ pH, produced from duplicate colonies, and were added to ultramafic minerals\
        \ in identical conditions. Filtering biolixiviants before bioleaching resulted\
        \ in similar metal concentrations when compared to whole-cell biolixiviants\
        \ when leaching dunite. A Welch's two-sample t-test shows that no significant\
        \ difference was detected between the unfiltered and filtered groups, with\
        \ p-values ranging from 0.2 to 0.9. This indicates that based on a 24-hour\
        \ leaching study, the presence of G. oxydans does not significantly improve\
        \ or diminish the effect of the biolixiviant on leaching in short term leaching.\\\
        n\\nA secondary control was performed using only gluconic acid diluted with\
        \ deionized water to the same pH as the acid biolixiviants produced by G.\
        \ oxydans. Reed et al. and Antonick et al. demonstrated that biolixiviants\
        \ produced by G. oxydans were noticeably more effective at bioleaching than\
        \ gluconic acid alone. However, recent anecdotal evidence suggests this is\
        \ not the case under all conditions. In our hands, when bioleaching ultramafic\
        \ materials at low pulp density (1%), G. oxydans-produced biolixiviants only\
        \ slightly outperform gluconic acid in leaching most metals (Fig. 2). Wild-type\
        \ G. oxydans biolixiviants leached only 6% more magnesium compared to pure\
        \ gluconic acid that was diluted with ultrapure water to the same pH after\
        \ 24 h of leaching. Furthermore, at least with low pulp density leaching,\
        \ filtering cells from the biolixiviant did not significantly affect bioleaching,\
        \ at least under the conditions of these tests (Fig. 4). This was done to\
        \ assess if there was a significant residual effect of microbial activity\
        \ on leaching after biolixiviant production. Furthermore, stoppering flasks\
        \ during leaching to prevent gas exchange did not significantly affect bioleaching\
        \ (Figure S5). Later in the article, we ask if there are conditions under\
        \ which the G. oxydans biolixiviant has a significant performance advantage\
        \ for bioleaching ultramafic materials.\\n\\nCellulosic hydrolysate can be\
        \ used as an alternative sugar feedstock for bioleaching\\n\\nTechno-economic\
        \ analysis shows that glucose feedstock for biolixiviant production is the\
        \ biggest cost driver in REE biomining with G. oxydans, accounting for almost\
        \ half of the total cost. Furthermore, the sheer scale that carbon sequestration\
        \ needs to operate at, means that enormous amounts of feedstock will be required,\
        \ potentially placing a significant demand on the world's biomass supply.\\\
        n\\nLignocellulose, found in agricultural waste, can be a renewable carbon\
        \ source for microbial growth and production once monomeric sugars are released\
        \ through acid pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis, making a glucose-rich\
        \ cellulosic hydrolysate. Lignocellulosic sugars are being increasingly investigated\
        \ as a potential alternative sugar source for several applications, including\
        \ biofuels/bioethanol production and substrates for cellular production. Utilizing\
        \ lignocellulose-derived sugars could serve as a high glucose replacement\
        \ feedstock that would greatly improve the cost-efficiency of bioleaching\
        \ for carbon capture technologies. G. oxydans has been shown to be able to\
        \ convert the glucose and xylose sugars in cellulosic hydrolysate into gluconic\
        \ acid and xylonic acid at extremely high efficiencies. Replacing pure glucose\
        \ with cellulosic hydrolysate could further improve the economic and environmental\
        \ viability of bio-accelerated weathering.\\n\\nG. oxydans has been shown\
        \ to efficiently produce gluconic acid and xylonic acid from lignocellulosic\
        \ hydrolysate feedstocks, making industrial-scale, bio-accelerated carbon\
        \ mineralization far more economically feasible. We investigated if biolixiviants\
        \ produced from cellulosic hydrolysate, rather than pure glucose, could be\
        \ effective at leaching dunite. The cellulosic hydrolysate (CH) used in this\
        \ study is a glucose-rich solution produced from the enzymatic hydrolysis\
        \ of concentrated corn stover (Table S3).\\n\\nUse of cellulosic hydrolysate\
        \ as a biolixiviant feedstock does not considerably reduce bioleaching efficiency.\
        \ Panels (A) to (E) show comparison of bioleaching of Mg, Mn, Fe, Co, and\
        \ Ni by Gluconobacter oxydans when using glucose and cellulosic hydrolysate\
        \ (CH) as as biolixiviant feedstock. CH-based biolixiviant leaches magnesium\
        \ on average at 72% the efficacy of glucose-based biolixiviant. Leaching was\
        \ performed with 1% dunite shaking at 22  C for 24 h. Stars denote significant\
        \ difference compared with glucose-based biolixiviants by a Welch's two-sample\
        \ t-test, where, p < 0.05 (*), p < 0.01 (**), p < 0.001 (***).\\n\\nBiolixiviants\
        \ produced from cellulosic hydrolysate were on average 28% less effective\
        \ in leaching magnesium compared to glucose-based biolixiviants (Fig. 5).\
        \ Leaching of Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni was also reduced by an average of 52% compared\
        \ to glucose-based biolixiviants (Fig. 5). Dunite was added at 1% pulp density,\
        \ and a leaching comparison between CH-based and glucose-based lixiviants\
        \ was conducted in parallel and in identical conditions. The cellulosic hydrolysate\
        \ added was diluted with deionized water so that the total sugar concentrations\
        \ were equal to the amount of glucose added for glucose-based biolixiviants.\\\
        n\\nDespite a 28% average reduction in Mg leaching, we were unable to detect\
        \ a statistically meaningful difference between glucose- and CH-based leaching\
        \ of Mg using a Welch's two-sample t-test. This was due to the small sample\
        \ size and variability in CH-based biolixiviant leachate measurements. Data\
        \ collected for CH-based biolixiviants resulted in greater variability than\
        \ data with glucose-based biolixiviants. ICP-MS analysis of cellulosic hydrolysate\
        \ samples showed that the CH used in this study contains trace concentrations\
        \ of metals, possibly as a result of the manufacturing process (Table S4).\
        \ When calculating the amounts of metal leached from CH-based biolixiviants,\
        \ the concentrations of metal in a cellulosic hydrolysate control study were\
        \ subtracted from the total detected to eliminate metal concentrations that\
        \ were not extracted from dunite. In low pulp density studies, the concentrations\
        \ of metals in the cellulosic hydrolysate feedstock interfered with metals\
        \ leached, resulting in higher overall error.\\n\\nCellulosic hydrolysate\
        \ produced from corn stover contains several toxins such as organic acids,\
        \ furan derivatives, and phenolic compounds that could inhibit the growth\
        \ of G. oxydans and its production of biolixiviant. Cellulosic hydrolysate\
        \ also significantly increases viscosity, resulting in lower oxygen transfer\
        \ rates that limit the fermentation of glucose to gluconic acid. Despite this,\
        \ leaching results show that G. oxydans can produce a biolixiviant from cellulosic\
        \ hydrolysate capable of leaching metals at concentrations significantly greater\
        \ than controls; however, further analysis and experimentation are needed\
        \ to show if CH can be a viable replacement to glucose without a significant\
        \ reduction in performance.\\n\\nAlthough cellulosic hydrolysate contains\
        \ mild antibiotic properties due to its acidity and certain toxic compounds,\
        \ this could be advantageous for the industrial scale use of it as a feedstock\
        \ for biolixiviant production. G. oxydans has high acid resistance and is\
        \ capable of growing and producing biolixiviant with cellulosic hydrolysate,\
        \ while many other microbes have low tolerance mechanisms for it. This could\
        \ allow for cellulosic hydrolysate to be used as an ultra-low-cost feedstock\
        \ while also preventing the growth of competing microbes. The toxic components\
        \ of cellulosic hydrolysate could also be a genetic engineering target for\
        \ G. oxydans, where mutants that have better resistance mechanisms can be\
        \ selected for to improve biolixiviant production.\\n\\nG. oxydans mutant\
        \ strain DeltapstS, P112:mgdh improved magnesium leaching by 12% over wild-type\\\
        n\\nA preliminary study using the mutant strain G. oxydans DeltapstS, P112:mgdh\
        \ shows that under identical growth and leaching conditions, mutant strains\
        \ of G. oxydans can be more effective than wild-type in leaching magnesium\
        \ and energy-critical metals from dunite.\\n\\nA bioleaching analysis over\
        \ 96 h using dunite at 1% pulp density was conducted with biolixiviant from\
        \ wild-type and mutant G. oxydans. Bioleachate samples were taken and analyzed\
        \ every 24 h up to 96 h using ICP-MS. The strain used is G. oxydans DeltapstS,\
        \ P112:mgdh, which was engineered to improve acid production for metal leaching.\
        \ It contains a clean deletion of the pstS gene which is involved in phosphate\
        \ signaling and transport, and an up-regulation with promoter P112 of the\
        \ mgdh gene (Membrane-bound Glucose DeHydrogenase) which is critical for converting\
        \ glucose into gluconic acid. The DeltapstS, P112:mgdh mutant was previously\
        \ shown to decrease the pH of biolixiviants compared to wild-type, and it\
        \ increases the overall leaching of REE. The biolixiviant produced from the\
        \ DeltapstS, P112:mgdh mutant had a pH of 2.01 +- 0.02 across all replicates,\
        \ while the pH of wild-type biolixiviants were 2.39 +- 0.02.\\n\\nBioleaching\
        \ efficiency of magnesium increased by an average of 12% when leaching with\
        \ a high performing G. oxydans mutant. The G. oxydans mutant contains a deletion\
        \ of pstS phosphate signaling and transport gene, alongside up-regulation\
        \ of the mgdh gene that codes for the Membrane-bound Glucose DeHydrogenase\
        \ (MGDH) with the P112 promoter (G. oxydans DeltapstS, P112:mdgh). Leaching\
        \ was done with dunite at 1% pulp density shaking at 22  C over 96 h. Stars\
        \ and dots denote a statistically significant difference between wild-type\

        n\\nThe analysis shows that DeltapstS, P112:mgdh mutant biolixiviant increases\
        \ magnesium leaching by an average of 12% over all samples taken between 24\
        \ and 96 h of leaching. Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni had an average improvement in leaching\
        \ of 12% using mutant biolixiviant compared to wild-type (Fig. 6).\\n\\nThe\
        \ entire genome of G. oxydans is yet to be completely characterized, and several\
        \ other genes may exist that are critical in controlling metal leaching from\
        \ ultramafic rocks. Future work to characterize the genome of G. oxydans in\
        \ terms of its functions related to ultramafic leaching is vital to engineer\
        \ better mutant strains that can improve the performance of bio-accelerated\
        \ weathering. The DeltapstS, P112:mgdh mutant is engineered to maximize gluconic\
        \ acid production; however, studies have shown that for rare earths leaching,\
        \ G. oxydans mutants can be screened to identify genes that specifically affect\
        \ rare earth extraction. Our research group has created a quality-controlled\
        \ (QC) whole genome knockout collection for G. oxydans B58, containing a collection\
        \ of 2,733 transposon disruption mutants, each with a different nonessential\
        \ gene disrupted. This QC collection enables a high-throughput screen of the\
        \ G. oxydans genome, selecting for significant changes to dunite leaching\
        \ efficacy. This will provide us with a roadmap for genetically engineering\
        \ G. oxydans for greater ultramafic bio-accelerated weathering capability.\\\
        n\\nG. oxydans biolixiviants are 3.2x more effective than gluconic acid at\
        \ 60% pulp density\\n\\nAt 60% pulp density, the wild-type G. oxydans biolixiviant\
        \ was 3.2x more effective at bioleaching dunite than gluconic acid diluted\
        \ to the same pH with pure water. A comparative bioleaching study was conducted\
        \ comparing the leaching efficacy of wild-type G. oxydans biolixiviants and\
        \ just gluconic acid at the same pH. Magnesium concentrations in leachate\
        \ were measured after 24, 48, and 72 h of leaching with 5% (A), 10% (B), and\
        \ 60% (C) dunite (DUN-2). At higher dunite pulp densities, the improvement\
        \ of Gluconobacter oxydans biolixiviants compared to gluconic acid was amplified.\
        \ After 72 h, biolixiviants were 74% better than gluconic acid at leaching\
        \ 5% dunite, 1.87 times better at leaching 10% dunite, and 2.25 times better\
        \ at leaching 60% dunite. Stars denote significant difference between gluconic\
        \ acid leaching and wild-type biolixiviant leaching by a Welch's two-sample\
        \ t-test, where, p < 0.05 (*), p < 0.01 (**), p < 0.001 (***).\\n\\nAt higher\
        \ pulp densities and longer leaching times, Gluconobacter oxydans biolixiviants\
        \ significantly outperformed gluconic acid at the same pH. We compared Gluconobacter\
        \ oxydans biolixiviants and gluconic acid metal leaching with 5%, 10%, and\
        \ 60% dunite pulp density, where leachate metal concentrations were measured\
        \ every 24 h for 72 h. The gluconic acid was diluted with ultrapure deionized\
        \ water to match the pH of biolixiviants, and leaching was performed in identical\
        \ conditions with the same mineral substrates (DUN-2). After 72 h of leaching,\
        \ wild-type biolixiviants leached 1.74 times more magnesium than gluconic\
        \ acid from 5% dunite, 2.87 times more from 10% dunite, and 3.25 times more\
        \ from 60% dunite (Fig. 7). At higher pulp densities, Gluconobacter oxydans\
        \ biolixiviants exhibit significantly higher leaching efficiency than gluconic\
        \ acid. This analysis suggests that metal leaching from dunite is not only\
        \ controlled by acidolysis, but might contain other biologically-synthesized\
        \ components that amplify extraction.\\n\\nMagnesium leaching relative to\
        \ glucose input can be greatly improved by process and genetic engineering\\\
        n\\nGlucose is the cost-limiting factor in utilizing G. oxydans biolixiviant\
        \ as a weathering accelerant. Furthermore, the sheer scale at which carbon\
        \ sequestration must operate requires enormous amounts of microbial feedstock,\
        \ possibly enough to make a significant demand on the world's biomass supply.\
        \ Therefore, it is essential to prioritize maximizing carbon dioxide sequestration\
        \ while minimizing feedstock consumption in order to mitigate the strain on\
        \ worldwide biomass resources.\\n\\nWe define the carbon investment to carbon\
        \ sequestration ratio, kseq, as the number of carbon atoms in the feedstock\
        \ (e.g., glucose) needed to liberate one magnesium ion (and hence sequester\
        \ the single atom of carbon in a CO2 molecule,\\n\\nLower kseq values indicate\
        \ that more magnesium was leached given a certain glucose input, while high\
        \ kseq values indicate relatively lower magnesium leaching for the same amount\
        \ of feedstock consumed. A kseq value of 6 for a glucose feedstock means that\
        \ one glucose molecule is necessary to liberate one magnesium ion (which has\
        \ the potential to sequester 1 CO2). A kseq value of 1 means that a minimum\
        \ of one feedstock carbon atom is needed to eventually sequester one CO2 molecule.\
        \ The statement that each liberated magnesium ion results in one CO2 molecule\
        \ sequestered assumes a 100% carbonation rate in a future downstream process\
        \ that converts magnesium in leachate into magnesite. kseq only illustrates\
        \ the lower limit of sugar input necessary to sequester CO2.\\n\\nWe can use\
        \ kseq to estimate the lower limit price of carbon sequestration and the total\
        \ amount of feedstock needed to sequester a useful amount of CO2 (e.g., 20\
        \ gigatonnes of CO2 per year). The mass of feedstock, Mfeedstock, needed to\
        \ sequester a given mass of CO2, ,\\n\\nwhere, MWfeedstock is the molecular\
        \ weight of the feedstock;  is the molecular weight of CO2, and nC, feedstock\
        \ is the average number of carbon atoms in each molecule of the feedstock.\
        \ Likewise, the cost to sequester a given mass of CO2,\\n\\nWhere pfeedstock\
        \ is the price per unit mass of the feedstock.\\n\\nProcess and genetic improvements\
        \ reduce the amount of feedstock carbon needed to potentially sequester one\
        \ CO2 molecule from 525 to 1. Increasing leaching time, pulp density, and\
        \ reducing average particle sizes were able to reduce kseq (glucose carbon\
        \ investment vs. carbon sequestration ratio) by several orders of magnitude.\
        \ Increasing dunite pulp density from 1-10% had a larger impact in reducing\
        \ kseq than increasing leaching time from 1 to 10 days. Combining the DeltapstS,\
        \ P112:mdgh double mutant with high pulp densities and long leaching times\
        \ resulted in a kseq value of 1 in three experiments (Col. 10-12). Leaching\
        \ attempts #1-9 used DUN-1 and attempts #10-12 used DUN-3 with a particle\
        \ size of less than 74 microns as the leaching substrate.\\n\\nIn this work,\
        \ we succeeded in reducing kseq from 525 to 1.0 (almost 3 orders of magnitude)\
        \ (Fig. 8). With 1% dunite and 24 h of leaching, the approximate kseq is 525\
        \ carbon invested/magnesium leached. One method to reduce kseq is to increase\
        \ the time of leaching. After 96 h of leaching, the magnesium concentration\
        \ increased by 81% when compared to 24 h leaching at the same pulp density\
        \ (Fig. 3). When increasing the time of leaching to 10 days, the magnesium\
        \ concentration improved by an average of 147% (Fig. 8). Increasing the pulp\
        \ density of dunite also reduces kseq. When compared to 1% pulp density of\
        \ dunite, increasing to 10% pulp density resulted in a 5-fold increase in\
        \ magnesium leaching after 24 h (Fig. 8). When combining 10% pulp density\
        \ with 10 days of leaching, magnesium leaching increased by 9.2 times that\
        \ of 1% pulp density leached for 1 day (Fig. 8), resulting in a kseq of 57,\
        \ since glucose input remained unchanged. For the lowest kseq values achieved,\
        \ fine-particle dunite at a pulp density of 60% was leached for 19 days with\
        \ three different methods (Fig. 8 Leaching Attempts #12-14). The first method\
        \ (Fig. 8 Leaching Attempt #12) was direct addition of 60% dunite, the second\
        \ method (Leaching Attempt #13) was a 2-step dunite addition, where 30% dunite\
        \ was added on day 0 and another 30% added on day 10, and the third method\
        \ (Leaching Attempt #14) was a 2-step dunite addition where the first 30%\
        \ dunite feed was removed from the leachate before the second 30% addition\
        \ on day 10. All three leaching methods resulted in a kseq equal to or less\
        \ than 1.0, with the lowest kseq being 0.96 on Leaching Attempt #13 in Fig.\
        \ 8.\\n\\nWhat implications do these results have for CO2 sequestration? For\
        \ kseq = 525, when using glucose as a feedstock, the cost of sequestering\
        \ 1 tonne of CO2 is $358,000, a long way above the US Department of Energy's\
        \ (DOE) target of $100 per tonne, and well above existing technologies. On\
        \ the other hand, if we could reduce kseq to 1 (as in Fig. 8) at industrial\
        \ scale, the cost of carbon sequestration (at least the microbial feedstock\
        \ part of the cost) through bio-accelerated weathering starts to become comparable\
        \ to (still high) current technologies, at $682 per tonne. If we could reduce\
        \ kseq to 0.15 (about a 6-fold reduction over our best attempt, much smaller\
        \ than the reduction we achieved in the course of writing this article) then\
        \ we could reduce the feedstock cost for sequestering 1 tonne of CO2 to $100.\
        \ This would not account for the costs of mining ultramafic material, but\
        \ nor does it account for the offset cost of energy-critical metal recovery.\
        \ However, using this to sequester 20 gigatonnes of CO2 a year would require\
        \ 2 billion tonnes of glucose, over 10 times current global annual sugar production.\\\
        n\\nSugars derived from cellulosic biomass are potentially much more abundant\
        \ than glucose that is derived from cereal crops like corn, sugar cane, and\
        \ sugar beet. While there is no widespread production of cellulosic sugars\
        \ today that is not immediately diverted to cellulosic ethanol production,\
        \ this could happen in the future. Furthermore, it is estimated that cellulosic\
        \ sugar production could be as low as $100 per tonne (in contrast to around\
        \ $1,000 per tonne for glucose). Although cellulosic sugars are abundant,\
        \ they are not limitless. Slade et al., made estimates of global bioenergy\
        \ supply, and concluded that several tipping points would occur as the amount\
        \ of biomass withdrawn from the biosphere for bioenergy (or some other chemical\
        \ production, such as carbon sequestration) increased, forcing increasingly\
        \ unpalatable choices on global society including mass adoption of vegetarian\
        \ diets, mass deforestation, population control, or combinations thereof.\
        \ Their analysis suggests that the first global agricultural tipping point\
        \ (choosing one of the three unpalatable options) would occur when biomass\
        \ was withdrawn at a rate of around 7 gigatonnes per year. Assuming that cellulosic\
        \ sugars are on average a 50:50 mix of C5 and C6 sugars, then to reduce the\
        \ cellulosic biomass demand to sequester 20 gigatonnes of CO2 to 3.5 gigatonnes,\
        \ kseq needs only to be reduced to 0.25.\\n\\nAlthough kseq serves as a useful\
        \ metric for displaying sugar investment in terms of CO2 sequestration potential,\
        \ it is only a theoretical value whose real value will depend on the conversion\
        \ rates of downstream CO2 mineralization. Since glucose inputs are a major\
        \ cost driver in bio-accelerated weathering, kseq can help estimate lower-limit\
        \ costs of scaled operations. Future scale-up work will be necessary to formulate\
        \ more accurate estimates of cost before they can be compared with other direct\
        \ CO2 mineralization technologies.\\n\\nPossibilities for downstream carbon\
        \ mineralization\\n\\nOn its own, G. oxydans bioleachate saturated with magnesium\
        \ ions will be difficult to convert into stable carbonate minerals. Due to\
        \ the nature of acid leaching, the final pH of biolixiviants post-leaching\
        \ tended to be low (4-5) in our experiments, making carbon mineralization\
        \ chemically unfavorable. Since pH has a significant influence on the precipitation\
        \ of carbonates due to the lower availability of carbonate ions in acidic\
        \ conditions, pH adjustments are required to increase carbonate mineral yields\
        \ downstream. Increasing the concentration of gaseous CO2 injected or sparged\
        \ through the leachate increases the total dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC);\
        \ however, this reduces the pH of the leachate, reducing carbonate ion availability\
        \ and decreasing the saturation index of carbonate minerals.\\n\\nA possible\
        \ downstream pathway to adjust the pH of leachates to make carbon dioxide\
        \ complexation chemically favorable is to add ammonia from biological or natural\
        \ sources to synthesize magnesite, MgCO3, or nesquehonite, MgCO3 3H2O. Adding\
        \ ammonia to CO2-sparged magnesium chloride solutions at ambient temperatures\
        \ was shown to completely convert free magnesium ions into nesquehonite in\
        \ about ten minutes. Furthermore, ammonia can be recycled in this process\
        \ through recovery of ammonia using activated carbon, which has been shown\
        \ to recover ammonium chloride salts and separate them into ammonia and hydrochloric\
        \ acid at near ambient conditions. Another possibility is to simply add sodium\
        \ hydroxide that has been electrically synthesized from carbon-neutral pathways.\\\
        n\\nMicrobes that accelerate carbon mineralization, such as cyanobacteria,\
        \ have been observed to accelerate mineralization in legacy alkaline mine\
        \ tailings. Coupling bio-accelerated weathering from Gluconobacter oxydans\
        \ with biotic downstream processes could maximize carbonate precipitation\
        \ in a low-resource and energy-efficient process that could be genetically\
        \ engineered further.\\n\\nScale-Up and future steps\\n\\nIn order to show\
        \ that bio-accelerated weathering is a feasible option for gigatonne-scale\
        \ CO2 sequestration, future work will be required to show that a scaled-up\
        \ bioprocess is possible without a significant reduction in efficiency compared\
        \ to the bench-scale experiments shown here.\\n\\nBench-scale lab results\
        \ rarely have equal yields and efficiencies when scaled up to pilot- or industrial-scale\
        \ bioprocesses. Being an obligate aerobe, G. oxydans requires air exchange\
        \ and consistent mixing for optimal growth. Furthermore, optimized mixing\
        \ of the mineral substrate with biolixiviants, rate of glucose supplementation,\
        \ rate of mineral addition, and optimized particle sizes for leaching are\
        \ yet to be thoroughly investigated. To address these scale-up challenges,\
        \ all process parameters will need to be investigated in bioreactor experiments.\\\
        n\\nAnother consideration is how cell viability changes throughout the leaching\
        \ process. G. oxydans has been shown to be resilient in high metal concentrations,\
        \ unlike several other microbes. However, having high pulp densities of dunite\
        \ would be a growth challenge for G. oxydans. Despite this, cell viability\
        \ during leaching may not be a critical parameter for the effectiveness of\
        \ leaching by G. oxydans biolixiviants. For short term leaching, it is shown\
        \ that having cells present in the biolixiviant has an insignificant effect\
        \ on leaching (Fig. 4). Since biolixiviants are produced in an independent\
        \ step before leaching begins (Figure S1), it is not essential to have live\
        \ cells present during leaching. However, possible direct microbe-mineral\
        \ interactions and continued acid production may have an effect on long-term\
        \ leaching and scaled processes.\\n\\nOvercoming the deceleration of leaching\
        \ over time is also a future scale-up challenge to address. The rates of leaching\
        \ were shown to slow down over the 96 h they were monitored (Fig. 3). As ultramafic\
        \ minerals are dissolved by biolixiviants, passivation layers can form from\
        \ amorphous silica (Note S1) or other mineral byproducts. Furthermore, as\
        \ the solution nears saturation of metal cations, dissolution rates are expected\
        \ to stagnate. Future investigations into overcoming the passivation layers\
        \ and developing integrated mineralization technologies to allow for continuous\
        \ leaching will be necessary for scale-up.\\n\\nUtilizing lignocellulosic-based\
        \ sugars as an alternative sugar feedstock also poses a challenge in scale-up.\
        \ Although G. oxydans has been shown to effectively produce biolixiviants\
        \ from cellulosic hydrolysate, the state of lignocellulosic sugar production\
        \ is underdeveloped. Large-scale production of sugars derived from second-generation\
        \ biomass (lignocellulose) is still limited, and developments in improving\
        \ efficiency and yield are ongoing. Advances in the supply chain of lignocellulosic\
        \ biomass and optimization in pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis will be\
        \ necessary in the near future for the large-scale implementation of lignocellulosic-based\
        \ sugars for bio-accelerated weathering.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nThis article\
        \ shows that G. oxydans possesses the capability to bioleach metals for energy\
        \ technologies and carbon mineralization from dunite. At low pulp densities\
        \ (1%), the G. oxydans organic acid-based biolixiviant is 20x more effective\
        \ at Mg leaching than deionized water. At high pulp densities (60%), the biolixiviant\
        \ is 3.2x better than even gluconic acid alone. This suggests that microbially-accelerated\
        \ weathering of ultramafic materials could be an environmentally-friendly\
        \ method for supplying Mg for mineralization of CO2, and metals like Ni and\
        \ Co for sustainable energy technologies at rates that can far exceed equivalent\
        \ abiotic methods.\\n\\nSeveral pH swing methods have been shown to be highly\
        \ effective for greatly accelerating olivine carbonation. However, scaling\
        \ up these technologies to meet the world's CO2 removal requirements may involve\
        \ high energy costs and environmental drawbacks like those found in strong\
        \ acid leaching involved with large scale energy-critical metal mining. Other\
        \ methods of accelerated weathering involving energy-intensive preprocessing\
        \ of mineral feedstocks by crushing, grinding, and chemically treating ultramafic\
        \ rocks also come with their own environmental and scaling drawbacks. In situ\
        \ accelerated ultramafic weathering can result in environmental leaching and\
        \ environmental drainage of harmful doses of nickel, chromium, and cobalt.\
        \ These methods also involve slow kinetics that depend on high energy inputs\
        \ to be accelerated and enormous land use.\\n\\nBio-accelerated weathering\
        \ may be an alternative approach to mineral weathering for carbon mineralization.\
        \ When engineered further, this strategy may prove an economically-viable\
        \ and scalable option that avoids the environmental concerns with in situ\
        \ mechanically-accelerated weathering and strong acid leaching, as well as\
        \ the energy costs involved in high temperature and pressure reactions. Energy\
        \ requirements for heating in common abiotic carbonation processes, such as\
        \ ammonium salts-driven pH swings and HCl pH swings, often result in CO2 emissions\
        \ greater than the amount sequestered. G. oxydans-based bioleaching was shown\
        \ to be effective at ambient temperature and pressure, removing a major energy\
        \ burden for this process.\\n\\nIn this article, we were able to reduce the\
        \ number of carbon atoms in glucose needed to sequester one molecule of CO2\
        \ from 525 to 1. However, further work needs to be done to optimize G. oxydans\
        \ for enhanced weathering for carbon mineralization. Maximizing the leaching\
        \ of magnesium while minimizing carbon inputs and lowering the economic costs\
        \ are key steps to making this technology viable for eliminating the several\
        \ gigatonnes of carbon dioxide in excess on our planet.\\n\\nMaterials and\
        \ methods\\n\\nUltramafic samples were collected from the Day Brook Dunite\
        \ (35  58' 0.45\\\" N, 82  16' 58.60\\\" W) in western North Carolina. The\
        \ chemically weathered exterior of the dunite was removed using a tile saw\
        \ (151991, MK Diamond Products, Inc., Torrance, CA). The trimmed interior\
        \ was crushed into powder using a SPEX SamplePrep 8000M mill and a tungsten\
        \ carbide vial. Before bioleaching experiments, the mineralogy of powder from\
        \ two samples was analyzed via x-ray diffraction (XRD) with a Bruker D8 Advance\
        \ ECO powder diffractometer at Cornell Center for Materials Research (CCMR).\
        \ The instrument is equipped with a Copper K-alpha X-ray source. Analyses\
        \ were made at 5 to 60 degrees, with an increment of 0.019 degrees and a dwell\
        \ time of 0.3 seconds per step. To mitigate Fe fluorescence the detector's\
        \ lower discriminator was raised from 0.110 V to 0.182 V. XRD shows that sample\
        \ DUN-1 consists of 64 wt. % olivine, 27 wt. % lizardite, 5 wt. % antigorite,\
        \ and 4 wt. % talc. Sample DUN-2 contains 37 wt. % olivine, 59 wt. % lizardite,\
        \ 2 wt. % talc, and 2 wt. % meixnerite. Sample DUN-3 contains 92 wt. % olivine,\
        \ 5 wt. % antigorite, 2 wt. % lizardite, and 1 wt. % talc. Major and trace\
        \ element compositions of the bulk rock were determined at the Hamilton Analytical\
        \ Laboratory in Clinton, NY via XRF and LA-ICPMS and are shown in Tables S1\
        \ and S2.\\n\\nThree separate dunite samples were used in bioleaching studies.\
        \ DUN-1 was used in the leaching studies shown in Figures 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and\
        \ Supplementary Figures S4 and S5. Due to the depletion of DUN-1 in previous\
        \ experiments, DUN-2 was used to produce the data used in Figure 7. DUN-3\
        \ was used in Leaching Attempts #10 and #12-14 in Figure 8 and Supplementary\
        \ Figure S3.\\n\\nMicroorganisms and media\\n\\nGluconobacter oxydans strain\
        \ NRRL B-58 (GoB58) was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection\
        \ (ATTC), Manassas, VA. In all experiments, GoB58 was cultured in Yeast-Peptone-Mannitol\
        \ media (YPM; 5 g L-1 yeast extract (C7341, Hardy Diagnostics, Santa Maria,\
        \ CA), 3 g L-1 peptone (211677, BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ), 25 g L-1 mannitol\
        \ (BDH9248, VWR Chemicals, Radnor, PA)).\\n\\nGluconobacter oxydans mutant\
        \ strain DeltapstS, P112:mdgh contains a clean deletion of the gene encoding\
        \ the periplasmic phosphate-binding protein, PstS, and an up-regulation of\
        \ the membrane-bound glucose dehydrogenase gene with promoter P112. This mutant\
        \ strain was previously constructed by Schmitz et al..\\n\\nGrowth and organic\
        \ acid production\\n\\nGoB58 was inoculated into YPM liquid culture then incubated\
        \ for 24 h at 30  C and 200 rpm in a shaking incubator (Infors HT Multitron).\
        \ Cultures were then back-diluted to OD590 of 0.05 in a total volume of 25\
        \ mL YPM in 50 mL flasks. The flasks were then incubated at 30  C and 200\
        \ rpm until the OD590 reaches approximately 1.5 after about 48 h. Cultures\
        \ were then split into 7.5 mL triplicates with 7.5 mL of 40% glucose added\
        \ to each triplicate, for a total volume of 15 mL. The glucose and bacterial\
        \ mixture was then incubated for 48 h at 30  C and 200 rpm, starting biolixiviant\
        \ production. After 48 h, the pH of each flask is measured (VWR Symphony B10P.).\\\
        n\\nCellulosic hydrolysate (National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Golden,\
        \ CO) was used in some leaching studies as an alternative glucose feedstock.\
        \ In experiments using cellulosic hydrolysate, it was diluted to 80% concentration\
        \ so that the total sugar concentrations (Table S2) would be equal to 40%.\
        \ Then 7.5 mL of 80% cellulosic hydrolysate was added in replacement of 7.5\
        \ mL of 40% glucose.\\n\\nBioleaching studies\\n\\nBioleaching experiments\
        \ were conducted with dunite at a pulp density of 1-10% wt/vol, as specified.\
        \ Minerals were added to 15 mL of biolixiviant, then agitated at room temperature\
        \ in a shaking incubator for 24 h. After 24 h, the ultramafic rock and biolixiviant\
        \ slurry was centrifuged and the bioleachate was extracted for ICP-MS analysis.\\\
        n\\nAnalytical methods\\n\\nLeachates from bioleaching experiments were filtered\
        \ through a 0.45 mum AcroPrep Advance 96-well filter plate (8029, Pall Corporation,\
        \ Show Low, AZ, USA) by centrifugation at 1,500 x g for 5 min, then diluted\
        \ to 1% with 2% trace metal grade nitric acid (JT9368, J.T. Baker, Radnor,\
        \ Pennsylvania, USA). Samples were analyzed with an Agilent 7800 ICP-MS. The\
        \ concentrations of metals were measured against a custom ICP-MS standard\
        \ solution containing 10 mg/L of Al, As, B, Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, K, Mg,\
        \ Mn, Mo, Na, Ni, P, Pb, S, Sb, Se, Si, Sn, and Zn (High Purity Standards,\
        \ North Charleston, SC) and an ICP-MS internal standard (5188-6525, Agilent\
        \ Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Quality checks were done with intermittent\
        \ standards and blanks as specified in the ICP-MS guidelines and protocols.\\\
        n\\nLimitations of the study\\n\\nThis study was designed to establish a baseline\
        \ understanding of ultramafic rock leaching by G. oxydans. The starting ultramafic\
        \ rocks were chosen due to their high olivine/forsterite content and low complexity\
        \ (lower content of other minerals). More industrially-applicable and abundant\
        \ starting materials, such as lower olivine-containing forms of dunite, ultramafic\
        \ mine tailings, and highly serpentinized ultramafic rocks will be investigated\
        \ in future studies.\\n\\nThis study only observes G. oxydans leaching over\
        \ short periods at relatively low pulp densities. While some experiments did\
        \ include high pulp densities for long periods (Fig. 8), a rigorous examination\
        \ of how leaching evolves over long periods was not conducted. Future experimentation\
        \ and cost analysis is necessary to determine optimal mineral pulp densities\
        \ and leaching times.\\n\\nThis study focuses on the extracted metal content\
        \ found in solution during leaching. A complete mass balance that monitors\
        \ the starting and ending mineral substrates will be addressed in future studies.\
        \ Future studies will also include surface area measurements of starting and\
        \ post-leaching mineral substrates.\\n\\nStatistics\\n\\nA Welch's two-sample\
        \ t-test was performed to determine statistical significance in comparative\
        \ bioleaching studies. A Welch's two-sample t-test was done since some studies,\
        \ such as a comparison of sugar feedstocks (Fig. 5), resulted in differences\
        \ in variances between the two groups tested. The Welch's t-test is more appropriate\
        \ in instances when the variances between two groups cannot be considered\
        \ as equal. Significance was displayed in all figures as dots and stars, where\
        \ p < 0.1 (.), p < 0.05 (*), p < 0.01 (**), p < 0.001 (***).\",\n  \"url\"\

        \ rape (6.3%), potato (3.7%), and soil (3.3%). The 331 Verticillium antagonists\
        \ were identified by their fatty acid methyl ester profiles. They were characterized\
        \ by testing their in vitro antagonism against other pathogenic fungi; their\
        \ glucanolytic, chitinolytic, and proteolytic activities; and their BOX-PCR\
        \ fingerprints. The abundance and composition of Verticillium antagonists\
        \ was plant species dependent. A rather high proportion of antagonists from\
        \ the strawberry rhizosphere was identified as Pseudomonas putida B (69%),\
        \ while antagonists belonging to the Enterobacteriaceae (Serratia spp., Pantoea\
        \ agglomerans) were mainly isolated from the rhizosphere of oilseed rape.\
        \ For P. putida A and B plant-specific genotypes were observed, suggesting\
        \ that these bacteria were specifically enriched in each rhizosphere.\",\n\

    for the article on the Nature website or through academic databases that provide
    access to scientific publications. These figures and their legends are typically
    detailed in the PDF or supplementary information files associated with the article.


    If you have access to the article or its supplementary materials, I recommend

              \ or sustained dystonic posturing. First described in 1981, it was initially\
              \ considered a motor disorder of sleep and was named nocturnal paroxysmal\
              \ dystonia (NPD). The unusual seizure semiology, onset during sleep,\
              \ and often uninformative scalp EEG and brain MRI make it difficult\
              \ to distinguish NPD attacks from other non-epileptic nocturnal paroxysmal\
              \ events, namely parasomnias. The long-debated epileptic origin of the\
              \ condition was finally demonstrated in 1990 and the term NFLE introduced.\
              \ Even though many aspects of parasomnias and NFLE have been clarified\
              \ in the last two decades, the differential diagnosis remains a challenge\

              \ criteria for NFLE, a Consensus Conference was held in Bologna, Italy\
              \ in 2014. Major points of agreement emerged on: (i) the relationship\
              \ of the seizures with sleep and not with the circadian pattern of seizure\
              \ occurrence; (ii) the possible extrafrontal origin of hypermotor seizures,\

        \ with seizures arising mainly during sleep and characterized by complex,\
        \ often bizarre, motor behavior or sustained dystonic posturing. First described\
        \ in 1981, it was initially considered a motor disorder of sleep and was named\
        \ nocturnal paroxysmal dystonia (NPD). The unusual seizure semiology, onset\
        \ during sleep, and often uninformative scalp EEG and brain MRI make it difficult\
        \ to distinguish NPD attacks from other non-epileptic nocturnal paroxysmal\
        \ events, namely parasomnias. The long-debated epileptic origin of the condition\
        \ was finally demonstrated in 1990 and the term NFLE introduced. Even though\
        \ many aspects of parasomnias and NFLE have been clarified in the last two\
        \ decades, the differential diagnosis remains a challenge for clinicians.\
        \ To address controversial issues and define the diagnostic criteria for NFLE,\
        \ a Consensus Conference was held in Bologna, Italy in 2014. Major points\
        \ of agreement emerged on: (i) the relationship of the seizures with sleep\
        \ and not with the circadian pattern of seizure occurrence; (ii) the possible\
        \ extrafrontal origin of hypermotor seizures, without substantial differences\
        \ in seizure semiology. In the wake of the Consensus, the syndrome was renamed\

  reason: The output fails to state the paper's actual finding (that microbes do not
    show oxidative stresses), instead incorrectly claiming evidence for oxidative
    stress. It does not mention that the paper is retracted or that the results should
    not be trusted. The only partial alignment is that it discusses oxidative stress,
    but all key evaluation steps are otherwise missed.

              \ residue wastes of ore processing. Those of metal mines, typically\
              \ Pb/Zn/Cu/Ni, always contain abundant sulphides that are mostly pyrite\
              \ based, e.g. FeS2. Due to the high reactivity of sulphides, high levels\
              \ of metals and salinity can be generated by the coupled weathering\
              \ of sulphide and carbonate wastes. This makes mine tailings a rather\
              \ hostile environment to microbes, while still a considerable amount\
              \ cells, though with a relatively low diversity compared with normal\
              \ soils, had been detected therein. The contribution of microbial activities\
              \ to the weathering of sulphides has long been recognized in mine tailings.\
              \ At the acid mine drainage (AMD) site of Iron Mountain, Calif., Thiobacillus\
              \ ferrooxidans and Leptospirillum ferrooxidans were found to be dominant\
              \ in the community and contribute to the generation of AMD. In a copper\
              \ bioleaching heap, sulfurophilic and iron-ophilic acidophilic bacteria\
              \ were found to actively colonize the mineral surface. These microbes\
              \ show adaptability to extremely acidic environment and play an important\
              \ role in the sustainability of this system. With the advent of the\
              \ modern molecular tools, community genomics of microbial consortia\
              \ in acid mine environments has been well explored, while that of alkaline\
              \ mine tailings has not been extensively studied. Alkaline mine environment\
              \ is normally subjected to revegetation which requires the establishment\
              \ of soil function including microbial diversity.\\n\\nMicrobial community\
              \ networks related to sulphide weathering in neutralized tailings have\
              \ been determined, yet these studies are based on mainly 16S rRNA gene\
              \ detection and then possible functions of the community members are\
              \ inferred from physiological information of known related pure cultures.\
              \ This approach is useful but is highly limited and speculative with\
              \ regard to approximating the community metabolic capabilities related\
              \ to the in situ elemental cycling and adaptation strategies. In contrast,\
              \ metagenome-based analyses enable reconstruction of nearly complete\
              \ genomes of microbial community members. Such analyses provides detailed\
              \ insights of metabolic capabilities and enables estimating the possible\
              \ contributions of populations to the community processes. Metagenomic\
              \ approaches have been successfully used to resolve the microbial biogeochemical\
              \ potential in saline sea water, and to reconstruct microbial metabolism\
              \ in AMD. It is found that acidophilic bacteria community in AMD has\
              \ a microbial diversity higher than expected. Recently, draft genomes\
              \ acquired through metagenomics have been used to understand the bacterial\
              \ colonization of the infant gut and microbial systems in hypersaline\
              \ lakes.\\n\\nIn this study, we analyzed metagenomes of alkaline sulphidic\
              \ tailings from a tailings storage facility of northwest Queensland.\
              \ Microbial metabolic capabilities for stress resistance and elemental\
              \ cycling were implied through the annotation of 10 metagenome-assembled\
              \ genomes (MAGs) from the tailings metagenomes. The results may provide\
              \ further understanding on biogeochemistry of alkaline sulphidic tailings\
              \ and valuable inference for tailings revegetation practice.\\n\\nMaterials\
              \ and methods\\n\\nSampling\\n\\nSampling sites and methods have been\
              \ described in our previous studies. Briefly, base metal mine tailings\
              \ were sampled from a storage facility Mt Isa, northwest Queensland.\
              \ The microbial community structure based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing\
              \ related to revegetation has been determined and described elsewhere.\
              \ The tailings mainly comprise of quartz, dolomite, pyrite, gypsum and\
              \ kaolinite, and contain approximately 1300, 1800 and 2900 mg/kg of\
              \ residue Cu, Pb and Zn, respectively. The 16S-based amplicon sequencing\
              \ reveals that the dominant microbial species in the tailings include\
              \ Rubrobacter spp. of the Actinobacteria, Truepera spp. of the Deinococcus-Thermus,\
              \ and Thioalkalivibrio spp. and Thiobacillus spp. of the Proteobacteria.\
              \ No substantial changes were detected of the microbial community structure\
              \ in summer and in winter, and dominant species changed little in spite\
              \ of significant increases in diversity detected along with the revegetation\
              \ efforts.\\n\\nFluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH)\\n\\nCells\
              \ from the tailings samples were firstly enriched by a sucrose density\
              \ centrifugation, followed by the standard FISH procedure for soil with\
              \ minor modifications. To obtain sufficient microbial cells from the\
              \ tailings, quadruplicates with 5 g of tailings each were used for cell\
              \ enrichment. Oligonucleotide probes were used for detecting bacteria\
              \ (mixed EUB338) and archaea (ARCH915). The hybridized samples were\
              \ observed within 24 h of performing the FISH and images were taken\
              \ using a ZEISS LSM 510 META Confocal Microscope. For enumeration of\
              \ microorganisms, from each sample a total of 30 confocal acquisitions\
              \ were taken, and 21 quality images were used to determine the cell\
              \ abundances using DAIME 1.3.\\n\\nDNA extraction and sequencing\\n\\\
              nDNA extraction was done using the PowerSoil  DNA Isolation Kit (MO\
              \ BIO Laboratories, Inc.), after cell enrichment using the previously\
              \ described protocol. A total of seven DNA samples of tailings samples\
              \ were subjected to shotgun sequencing. The sequencing was done at the\
              \ Institute for Molecular Bioscience, The University of Queensland,\
              \ using Illumina MiSeq with paired-end 300 bp reads. The detailed sequencing\
              \ method is described in our previous study.\\n\\nBioinformatics\\n\\\
              nFor the purpose of high quality assembly of the metagenome, the seven\
              \ metagenomes were pooled together and analyzed using the flexible pipeline\
              \ MetaWRAP for genome-resolved metagenomic data analysis. The assembly\
              \ module was used for sequence assembly. The assembly contigs obtained\
              \ were all longer than 1000 bp. The workflow of MaxBin2 in MetaWRAP\
              \ was used for contig encapsulation. MetaWRAP provides three assembly\
              \ pipelines, namely Concoct, Metabat2 and Maxbin2, and after comparison\
              \ Maxbin2 was chose for subsequent analysis. Then the obtained bins\
              \ were further analyzed for species annotation. Species annotation was\
              \ performed in the annotate_bins module, based on the NCBI_nt and NCBI_tax\
              \ databases. Taxator-tk was used for the classification of each contig,\
              \ and a bin as a whole was estimated to annotate species. CheckM was\
              \ used for the quality assessment of the assembled bins (MAGs; https://ecogenomics.github.io/CheckM/).\
              \ For gene annotation, a cutoff E value of 10- 6 and an identity of\
              \ 70% were used. Metawrap was run on a 42-core, 192 GB RAM server. Bins\
              \ were then used for microbial metabolic pathway analysis using the\
              \ online analysis platform KEGG.\\n\\nResults and discussion\\n\\nThe\
              \ environment\\n\\nThe tailings studied are basically neutral/alkaline\
              \ in pH and of a high level of residue heavy metals, salinity and sulphidic\
              \ minerals. Salinity and metal release in sulphidic tailings is mostly\
              \ from the coupled weathering of sulphides and carbonates. The microbially-mediated\
              \ and chemical-mediated weathering of sulphides would have both occurred\
              \ in the amended and revegetated tailings. The microbial processes may\
              \ become as important as the chemical weathering processes in neutral/alkaline\
              \ sulphidic tailings, where the redox potential of oxygen and ferric\
              \ is reduced by the high pH and ferrous can be oxidized more easily\
              \ with diverse electron-acceptors (e.g. nitrate). Moreover, increased\
              \ nutrients supplied from the organic matter amendment and plant roots,\
              \ as indicated by our previous studies, is very likely resulting in\
              \ increased activities of the sulphide weathering microorganisms.\\\
              n\\nCell abundance in the tailings\\n\\nCell abundance in the tailings\
              \ was enumerated using conventional FISH. We examined samples by FISH\
              \ that were prepared as either sterilized raw tailings, the raw tailings\
              \ or a cell enrichment obtained from the tailings by sucrose density\
              \ gradient centrifugation. Strong background fluorescence was observed\
              \ and direct observation of cell fluorescence was impossible for raw\
              \ tailings materials. Background fluorescence is a common problem for\
              \ cell enumeration in soil-like materials using FISH, and can be strong\
              \ in metal tailings due to the presence of abundant uranium, lead and\
              \ molybdenum minerals.\\n\\nA representative FISH image (magnification,\
              \ x 100) of the bacterial (green, FITC dyes) and archaeal cells (red,\
              \ Cy3 dyes) detected in the tailing\\n\\nThe FISH images taken on tailings\
              \ samples prepared by cell enrichment were of good quality and suitable\
              \ for cell enumeration (Fig. 1). The bacterial cell number in the tailings\
              \ was estimated to be approximately 107 cells/g tailings, assuming the\
              \ cell extraction efficiency to be 10%. Bacteria made up the major component\
              \ of the cells and Archaea were only scarcely detected. We did not detect\
              \ any difference of the cell abundances between the tailings with and\
              \ without revegetation. The bacterial and archaeal cell abundances in\
              \ these tailings is close to those reported for other base metal tailings.\

              \ of 5 Gb of sequenced DNA obtained from the tailing samples resulted\
              \ in 10 genomic bins belonging to eight genera (Table 1). Five of the\
              \ 10 MAGs, Rubrobacter sp., Truepera sp., Thioalkalivibrio sp., Acidimicrobium\
              \ sp. and Rhodomicrobium sp., had high completeness of > 90% and a contamination\
              \ rate of 1.35-4.87%. Our previous studies based on 16S rRNA amplicon\
              \ sequencing showed that these 5 genera on average accounted for > 12%\
              \ of the total communities in the tailings sampled. These 5 MAGs were\
              \ of high quality, which were binned with an N50 of 9307-32,314 bp,\
              \ with the longest contigs ranging between 51,994-209,767 bp and the\
              \ number of coding sequences ranging between 2963 and 4168. Five other\
              \ bins were obtained of a lower quality but with a completeness > 50%.\
              \ These results enabled the metabolic capacities of the communities\
              \ to be determined and these capacities could be related to the tailings'\
              \ bio-weathering. All the microbial genetic features discussed here\
              \ were based on the annotation of contigs with a length > 8000 bp. Restricting\
              \ the analyses to large contigs would serve to minimize system errors\
              \ such as those caused by sequencing and bioinformatic assembly. This\
              \ metagenomic-based analysis allows a comprehensive estimation of the\
              \ community metabolic networks. Additionally, the sequencing depth obtained\
              \ here was much greater than that of previous metagenomic studies of\
              \ other tailings communities, which in this instance enabled good estimations\
              \ of the community metabolic capabilities. \\n\\nGenetic features detected\

              \ for acquiring energy and stress resistance in the tailing environment\
              \ (Table 2). Rubrobacter sp. had a wide spectrum of genes for utilizing\
              \ polysaccharides and aromatic compounds, such as the pca, sal, cat\
              \ and bpa operons. This kind of capability would be particularly important\
              \ considering tailings are an oligotrophic environment, and in this\
              \ instance, the organic amendment for revegetation in the form of woodchips\
              \ would have caused an increase in content of polysaccharides and chitin.\
              \ However, it is worth noting that the N content of the tailings and\
              \ woodchips was very low, which would have impeded the decomposition\
              \ of the woodchips in the long run. Our recent studies report a very\
              \ slow decomposition of litter amendment in the tailings. Nonetheless,\
              \ the utilization of diverse organic molecules such as polysaccharides\
              \ and aromatic compounds may be a vital survival strategy for these\
              \ microbes after depleting easily labile and soluble organic carbon.\

              \ sp. and Thiobacillus sp. may have found niches within the tailings\
              \ by consuming sulphides and respiring on nitrates, as inferred by the\
              \ presence of sulfur-oxidizing and denitrification genes in their binned\
              \ MAGs. Interestingly, Rubrobacter sp. and Acidimicrobium sp. were found\
              \ to have cox operons for CO oxidation, inferring an ability to respire\
              \ on CO. CO utilization has been documented for many microbes residing\
              \ in saline environments, such as in seawater and saline soils. In addition,\
              \ four out of the eight genera were found to contain genes for CO2 fixation,\
              \ in the form of a minimum set of cbbLSX (Fig. 2). The findings imply\
              \ these genera can utilize atmospheric carbon sources, and this may\
              \ greatly increase their survival ability in the oligotrophic tailings\

              \ for ferroxidase (Fig. 4) and superoxide dismutases as well as genes\
              \ for Fe uptake systems (e.g. Fur, pit) in almost all the tailings MAGs.\
              \ Likely, these genes are providing these microorganisms with defenses\
              \ against oxidative stress. Other protection mechanisms like methylglyoxal\
              \ detoxification genes and glutaredoxin genes were also detected in\
              \ most of the MAGs. \\n\\nSulphide oxidation and salinity generation\\\

              n\\nKEGG annotation successfully reconstructed the metabolic capacity\
              \ of sulphide oxidation and nitrogen cycling of the microbial consortia,\
              \ which may be vital for the survival of the community via inter-species\
              \ cooperation (Fig. 5). Two microbial pathways for sulphide oxidation,\
              \ the direct contact pathway and indirect pathway, may exist in the\
              \ tailings (Fig. 5). Thioalkalivibrio sp., Acidimicrobium sp. and Thiobacillus\
              \ sp. are well known sulfur oxidizers able to respire on sulphides,\
              \ and in this study dsr (organized as dsrABCKJOPR) and sox (organized\
              \ as soxXYZABH) genes for sulphur oxidation were found in these three\
              \ MAGs from the tailings. Thioalkalivibrio sp. and Thiobacillus sp.\
              \ were both found to harbor novel conserved genes (Blr3520 genes) annotated\
              \ for sulfur oxidation as well. In addition, msh operons encoding mannose-sensitive\
              \ haemagglutinin (MSHA)-like pilus for cell attachment to substrates\
              \ were detected in the Thioalkalivibrio sp. genome. This indicated the\
              \ ability of Thioalkalivibrio sp. to attach to pyrite surfaces for oxidation\
              \ activities. Microbes can colonize and etch pyrite surfaces directly\
              \ and oxidize the released sulfur, which was recently observed during\
              \ ferric-catalyzed pyrite oxidation. The features detected in the abovementioned\
              \ genomes coincide with this model. It is thus suggested that in the\
              \ oxic layer of the tailings Thioalkalivibrio sp., Acidimicrobium sp.\
              \ and Thiobacillus sp. may colonize and oxidize sulphides particles\
              \ directly, causing mineral dissolution and contributing to the elevated\
              \ levels of salinity and metals in the pore water. \\n\\nGenomic features\
              \ detected here also inferred an indirect oxidation of sulphides in\
              \ the tailings through the coupled reactions of ferrous oxidation and\
              \ nitrate reduction which may occur in an anoxic layer. Diverse ferroxidases\
              \ were detected in all the MAGs (Table 2), indicating intensive microbial\
              \ activities to regenerate ferric which is a strong oxidant for sulphide\
              \ dissolution. Additionally, a full set of denitrification genes (nar,\
              \ nir, nor, nos) were detected in the Thioalkalivibrio sp. and Thiobacillus\
              \ sp. MAGs. It has been determined that total nitrogen is extremely\
              \ low (< 0.006%) in the tailings and most of this is in the form of\
              \ microbial biomass (50-100%). There is the possibility that anaerobic\
              \ microbial sulphide oxidation has occurred here with nitrate as electron\
              \ acceptor. Other studies showed that pyrite minerals of nano-size were\
              \ oxidized by Thiobacillus denitrificans with nitrate as electron acceptor.\
              \ Sulphides in the tailings used in this study may favor this indirect\
              \ pathway due to their texture dominated by fine silt when nitrate is\
              \ present. This claim about the role of nitrate in sulfide oxidation\
              \ requires experimental verification in purposely designed physiological\
              \ tests.\\n\\nNitrogen deficiency is a common problem in tailings limiting\
              \ plant growth, and its microbial cycling has not been well studied\
              \ for neutral/alkaline metal tailings. Our results highlight the possibility\
              \ of nitrate-depletion by microbial sulphides oxidation as well as by\
              \ CO oxidation in the tailings. Nitrogen fixing mechanisms in the tailings\
              \ remains largely unknown. The key nitrogen fixing genes were not detected,\
              \ with only nifU present in the Rubrobacter sp. and Acidimicrobium sp.\

        \  \"text\": \"Introduction\\n\\nMine tailings are milled residue wastes of\
        \ ore processing. Those of metal mines, typically Pb/Zn/Cu/Ni, always contain\
        \ abundant sulphides that are mostly pyrite based, e.g. FeS2. Due to the high\
        \ reactivity of sulphides, high levels of metals and salinity can be generated\
        \ by the coupled weathering of sulphide and carbonate wastes. This makes mine\
        \ tailings a rather hostile environment to microbes, while still a considerable\
        \ amount cells, though with a relatively low diversity compared with normal\
        \ soils, had been detected therein. The contribution of microbial activities\
        \ to the weathering of sulphides has long been recognized in mine tailings.\
        \ At the acid mine drainage (AMD) site of Iron Mountain, Calif., Thiobacillus\
        \ ferrooxidans and Leptospirillum ferrooxidans were found to be dominant in\
        \ the community and contribute to the generation of AMD. In a copper bioleaching\
        \ heap, sulfurophilic and iron-ophilic acidophilic bacteria were found to\
        \ actively colonize the mineral surface. These microbes show adaptability\
        \ to extremely acidic environment and play an important role in the sustainability\
        \ of this system. With the advent of the modern molecular tools, community\
        \ genomics of microbial consortia in acid mine environments has been well\
        \ explored, while that of alkaline mine tailings has not been extensively\
        \ studied. Alkaline mine environment is normally subjected to revegetation\
        \ which requires the establishment of soil function including microbial diversity.\\\
        n\\nMicrobial community networks related to sulphide weathering in neutralized\
        \ tailings have been determined, yet these studies are based on mainly 16S\
        \ rRNA gene detection and then possible functions of the community members\
        \ are inferred from physiological information of known related pure cultures.\
        \ This approach is useful but is highly limited and speculative with regard\
        \ to approximating the community metabolic capabilities related to the in\
        \ situ elemental cycling and adaptation strategies. In contrast, metagenome-based\
        \ analyses enable reconstruction of nearly complete genomes of microbial community\
        \ members. Such analyses provides detailed insights of metabolic capabilities\
        \ and enables estimating the possible contributions of populations to the\
        \ community processes. Metagenomic approaches have been successfully used\
        \ to resolve the microbial biogeochemical potential in saline sea water, and\
        \ to reconstruct microbial metabolism in AMD. It is found that acidophilic\
        \ bacteria community in AMD has a microbial diversity higher than expected.\
        \ Recently, draft genomes acquired through metagenomics have been used to\
        \ understand the bacterial colonization of the infant gut and microbial systems\
        \ in hypersaline lakes.\\n\\nIn this study, we analyzed metagenomes of alkaline\
        \ sulphidic tailings from a tailings storage facility of northwest Queensland.\
        \ Microbial metabolic capabilities for stress resistance and elemental cycling\
        \ were implied through the annotation of 10 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs)\
        \ from the tailings metagenomes. The results may provide further understanding\
        \ on biogeochemistry of alkaline sulphidic tailings and valuable inference\
        \ for tailings revegetation practice.\\n\\nMaterials and methods\\n\\nSampling\\\
        n\\nSampling sites and methods have been described in our previous studies.\
        \ Briefly, base metal mine tailings were sampled from a storage facility Mt\
        \ Isa, northwest Queensland. The microbial community structure based on 16S\
        \ rRNA gene sequencing related to revegetation has been determined and described\
        \ elsewhere. The tailings mainly comprise of quartz, dolomite, pyrite, gypsum\
        \ and kaolinite, and contain approximately 1300, 1800 and 2900 mg/kg of residue\
        \ Cu, Pb and Zn, respectively. The 16S-based amplicon sequencing reveals that\
        \ the dominant microbial species in the tailings include Rubrobacter spp.\
        \ of the Actinobacteria, Truepera spp. of the Deinococcus-Thermus, and Thioalkalivibrio\
        \ spp. and Thiobacillus spp. of the Proteobacteria. No substantial changes\
        \ were detected of the microbial community structure in summer and in winter,\
        \ and dominant species changed little in spite of significant increases in\
        \ diversity detected along with the revegetation efforts.\\n\\nFluorescent\
        \ in situ hybridization (FISH)\\n\\nCells from the tailings samples were firstly\
        \ enriched by a sucrose density centrifugation, followed by the standard FISH\
        \ procedure for soil with minor modifications. To obtain sufficient microbial\
        \ cells from the tailings, quadruplicates with 5 g of tailings each were used\
        \ for cell enrichment. Oligonucleotide probes were used for detecting bacteria\
        \ (mixed EUB338) and archaea (ARCH915). The hybridized samples were observed\
        \ within 24 h of performing the FISH and images were taken using a ZEISS LSM\
        \ 510 META Confocal Microscope. For enumeration of microorganisms, from each\
        \ sample a total of 30 confocal acquisitions were taken, and 21 quality images\
        \ were used to determine the cell abundances using DAIME 1.3.\\n\\nDNA extraction\
        \ and sequencing\\n\\nDNA extraction was done using the PowerSoil  DNA Isolation\
        \ Kit (MO BIO Laboratories, Inc.), after cell enrichment using the previously\
        \ described protocol. A total of seven DNA samples of tailings samples were\
        \ subjected to shotgun sequencing. The sequencing was done at the Institute\
        \ for Molecular Bioscience, The University of Queensland, using Illumina MiSeq\
        \ with paired-end 300 bp reads. The detailed sequencing method is described\
        \ in our previous study.\\n\\nBioinformatics\\n\\nFor the purpose of high\
        \ quality assembly of the metagenome, the seven metagenomes were pooled together\
        \ and analyzed using the flexible pipeline MetaWRAP for genome-resolved metagenomic\
        \ data analysis. The assembly module was used for sequence assembly. The assembly\
        \ contigs obtained were all longer than 1000 bp. The workflow of MaxBin2 in\
        \ MetaWRAP was used for contig encapsulation. MetaWRAP provides three assembly\
        \ pipelines, namely Concoct, Metabat2 and Maxbin2, and after comparison Maxbin2\
        \ was chose for subsequent analysis. Then the obtained bins were further analyzed\
        \ for species annotation. Species annotation was performed in the annotate_bins\
        \ module, based on the NCBI_nt and NCBI_tax databases. Taxator-tk was used\
        \ for the classification of each contig, and a bin as a whole was estimated\
        \ to annotate species. CheckM was used for the quality assessment of the assembled\
        \ bins (MAGs; https://ecogenomics.github.io/CheckM/). For gene annotation,\
        \ a cutoff E value of 10- 6 and an identity of 70% were used. Metawrap was\
        \ run on a 42-core, 192 GB RAM server. Bins were then used for microbial metabolic\
        \ pathway analysis using the online analysis platform KEGG.\\n\\nResults and\
        \ discussion\\n\\nThe environment\\n\\nThe tailings studied are basically\
        \ neutral/alkaline in pH and of a high level of residue heavy metals, salinity\
        \ and sulphidic minerals. Salinity and metal release in sulphidic tailings\
        \ is mostly from the coupled weathering of sulphides and carbonates. The microbially-mediated\
        \ and chemical-mediated weathering of sulphides would have both occurred in\
        \ the amended and revegetated tailings. The microbial processes may become\
        \ as important as the chemical weathering processes in neutral/alkaline sulphidic\
        \ tailings, where the redox potential of oxygen and ferric is reduced by the\
        \ high pH and ferrous can be oxidized more easily with diverse electron-acceptors\
        \ (e.g. nitrate). Moreover, increased nutrients supplied from the organic\
        \ matter amendment and plant roots, as indicated by our previous studies,\
        \ is very likely resulting in increased activities of the sulphide weathering\
        \ microorganisms.\\n\\nCell abundance in the tailings\\n\\nCell abundance\
        \ in the tailings was enumerated using conventional FISH. We examined samples\
        \ by FISH that were prepared as either sterilized raw tailings, the raw tailings\
        \ or a cell enrichment obtained from the tailings by sucrose density gradient\
        \ centrifugation. Strong background fluorescence was observed and direct observation\
        \ of cell fluorescence was impossible for raw tailings materials. Background\
        \ fluorescence is a common problem for cell enumeration in soil-like materials\
        \ using FISH, and can be strong in metal tailings due to the presence of abundant\
        \ uranium, lead and molybdenum minerals.\\n\\nA representative FISH image\
        \ (magnification, x 100) of the bacterial (green, FITC dyes) and archaeal\
        \ cells (red, Cy3 dyes) detected in the tailing\\n\\nThe FISH images taken\
        \ on tailings samples prepared by cell enrichment were of good quality and\
        \ suitable for cell enumeration (Fig. 1). The bacterial cell number in the\
        \ tailings was estimated to be approximately 107 cells/g tailings, assuming\
        \ the cell extraction efficiency to be 10%. Bacteria made up the major component\
        \ of the cells and Archaea were only scarcely detected. We did not detect\
        \ any difference of the cell abundances between the tailings with and without\
        \ revegetation. The bacterial and archaeal cell abundances in these tailings\
        \ is close to those reported for other base metal tailings. \\n\\nThe community\

        \ obtained from the tailing samples resulted in 10 genomic bins belonging\
        \ to eight genera (Table 1). Five of the 10 MAGs, Rubrobacter sp., Truepera\
        \ sp., Thioalkalivibrio sp., Acidimicrobium sp. and Rhodomicrobium sp., had\
        \ high completeness of > 90% and a contamination rate of 1.35-4.87%. Our previous\
        \ studies based on 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing showed that these 5 genera\
        \ on average accounted for > 12% of the total communities in the tailings\
        \ sampled. These 5 MAGs were of high quality, which were binned with an N50\
        \ of 9307-32,314 bp, with the longest contigs ranging between 51,994-209,767\
        \ bp and the number of coding sequences ranging between 2963 and 4168. Five\
        \ other bins were obtained of a lower quality but with a completeness > 50%.\
        \ These results enabled the metabolic capacities of the communities to be\
        \ determined and these capacities could be related to the tailings' bio-weathering.\
        \ All the microbial genetic features discussed here were based on the annotation\
        \ of contigs with a length > 8000 bp. Restricting the analyses to large contigs\
        \ would serve to minimize system errors such as those caused by sequencing\
        \ and bioinformatic assembly. This metagenomic-based analysis allows a comprehensive\
        \ estimation of the community metabolic networks. Additionally, the sequencing\
        \ depth obtained here was much greater than that of previous metagenomic studies\
        \ of other tailings communities, which in this instance enabled good estimations\
        \ of the community metabolic capabilities. \\n\\nGenetic features detected\

        \ Thioalkalivibrio sp. and Thiobacillus sp., were identified to have prominent\
        \ capacities for acquiring energy and stress resistance in the tailing environment\
        \ (Table 2). Rubrobacter sp. had a wide spectrum of genes for utilizing polysaccharides\
        \ and aromatic compounds, such as the pca, sal, cat and bpa operons. This\
        \ kind of capability would be particularly important considering tailings\
        \ are an oligotrophic environment, and in this instance, the organic amendment\
        \ for revegetation in the form of woodchips would have caused an increase\
        \ in content of polysaccharides and chitin. However, it is worth noting that\
        \ the N content of the tailings and woodchips was very low, which would have\
        \ impeded the decomposition of the woodchips in the long run. Our recent studies\
        \ report a very slow decomposition of litter amendment in the tailings. Nonetheless,\
        \ the utilization of diverse organic molecules such as polysaccharides and\
        \ aromatic compounds may be a vital survival strategy for these microbes after\
        \ depleting easily labile and soluble organic carbon. \\n\\nA Neighbor-Joining\
        \ tree showing the phylogenetics of the genes for ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase\
        \ large chain of carbon fixation recovered from the binned genomes in this\
        \ study. The tree was constructed using MEGA 6.06 based on the sequence alignment\
        \ using the CLUSTAL method with default parameters\\n\\nThioalkalivibrio sp.,\
        \ Acidimicrobium sp. and Thiobacillus sp. may have found niches within the\
        \ tailings by consuming sulphides and respiring on nitrates, as inferred by\
        \ the presence of sulfur-oxidizing and denitrification genes in their binned\
        \ MAGs. Interestingly, Rubrobacter sp. and Acidimicrobium sp. were found to\
        \ have cox operons for CO oxidation, inferring an ability to respire on CO.\
        \ CO utilization has been documented for many microbes residing in saline\
        \ environments, such as in seawater and saline soils. In addition, four out\
        \ of the eight genera were found to contain genes for CO2 fixation, in the\
        \ form of a minimum set of cbbLSX (Fig. 2). The findings imply these genera\
        \ can utilize atmospheric carbon sources, and this may greatly increase their\
        \ survival ability in the oligotrophic tailings environment. \\n\\nKey functional\
        \ genes/pathways related to the environment\\n\\nGene clusters for metal resistance\
        \ found in the binned genomes from the Mt Isa metal mine tailings. HMT, hypothetical\
        \ metal transporter gene; czc, cadmium-zinc-cobalt resistance gene; H, hypothetical\
        \ gene; GLU, ferredoxin-dependent glutamate synthase; ccdA, antitoxin gene;\
        \ ars, arsenic resistance genes; mer, mercury resistance genes; MDM, hypothetical\
        \ metal-related genes; tetR, tetracycline repressor gene; dsb, thiol:disulfide\
        \ interchange genes; cad, cadmium resistance genes; cop, copper resistance\
        \ genes; chr, chromium resistance genes. More details can be found in the\
        \ notes of Table 2\\n\\nThe ability of microbes to cope with salinity and\
        \ metal (loid) stress in the tailings was evident in the annotated MAGs. Various\
        \ genes for osmotic stress resistance were detected in the MAGs of Rubrobacter\
        \ sp., Truepera sp., Thioalkalivibrio sp., and Acidimicrobium sp.. These included\
        \ bet and pro systems that code for the choline monooxygenase/betaine aldehyde\
        \ dehydrogenase pathway and for the L-proline glycine betaine ABC transport\
        \ system, respectively. Genes coding for resistance to all the metals Zn,\
        \ Cd, As, Cu and Pb were detected in all genera. Impressively, multiple copies\
        \ of czc, encoding for Co-Zn-Cd resistance, were frequently detected in one\
        \ contig (Fig. 3). All the MAGs contained both the pco and cop systems for\
        \ Cu resistance, and 6 out of the 8 genera had both the ACR3 and ars systems\
        \ for As resistance (Table 2). The high frequency of these systems emphasizes\
        \ the importance of metal resistance for microbial survival in the tailings.\
        \ \\n\\nA Neighbor-Joining tree showing the phylogenetics of the ferroxidase\
        \ genes recovered from the binned genomes in this study. The tree was constructed\
        \ using MEGA 6.06 based on the sequence alignment using the CLUSTAL method\
        \ with default parameters\\n\\nSulphidic metal tailings are an environment\
        \ where multiple stresses will occur. This includes those of oxidative damage\
        \ (such as from free Fe2+), salinity, moisture content changes, and extremely\
        \ high levels of heavy metals. The Fenton reaction of intracellular Fe2+ by\
        \ superoxide is fatal to cells. We detected genes for ferroxidase (Fig. 4)\
        \ and superoxide dismutases as well as genes for Fe uptake systems (e.g. Fur,\
        \ pit) in almost all the tailings MAGs. Likely, these genes are providing\
        \ these microorganisms with defenses against oxidative stress. Other protection\
        \ mechanisms like methylglyoxal detoxification genes and glutaredoxin genes\
        \ were also detected in most of the MAGs. \\n\\nSulphide oxidation and salinity\
        \ generation\\n\\nA conceptual diagram depicting the microbial mediated sulphide\
        \ oxidation resulting salinity and N depletion in the tailings. DMO, direct\
        \ microbial oxidation; IO, inorganic oxidation; IMO, indirect microbial oxidation\\\
        n\\nKEGG annotation successfully reconstructed the metabolic capacity of sulphide\
        \ oxidation and nitrogen cycling of the microbial consortia, which may be\
        \ vital for the survival of the community via inter-species cooperation (Fig.\
        \ 5). Two microbial pathways for sulphide oxidation, the direct contact pathway\
        \ and indirect pathway, may exist in the tailings (Fig. 5). Thioalkalivibrio\
        \ sp., Acidimicrobium sp. and Thiobacillus sp. are well known sulfur oxidizers\
        \ able to respire on sulphides, and in this study dsr (organized as dsrABCKJOPR)\
        \ and sox (organized as soxXYZABH) genes for sulphur oxidation were found\
        \ in these three MAGs from the tailings. Thioalkalivibrio sp. and Thiobacillus\
        \ sp. were both found to harbor novel conserved genes (Blr3520 genes) annotated\
        \ for sulfur oxidation as well. In addition, msh operons encoding mannose-sensitive\
        \ haemagglutinin (MSHA)-like pilus for cell attachment to substrates were\
        \ detected in the Thioalkalivibrio sp. genome. This indicated the ability\
        \ of Thioalkalivibrio sp. to attach to pyrite surfaces for oxidation activities.\
        \ Microbes can colonize and etch pyrite surfaces directly and oxidize the\
        \ released sulfur, which was recently observed during ferric-catalyzed pyrite\
        \ oxidation. The features detected in the abovementioned genomes coincide\
        \ with this model. It is thus suggested that in the oxic layer of the tailings\
        \ Thioalkalivibrio sp., Acidimicrobium sp. and Thiobacillus sp. may colonize\
        \ and oxidize sulphides particles directly, causing mineral dissolution and\
        \ contributing to the elevated levels of salinity and metals in the pore water.\
        \ \\n\\nGenomic features detected here also inferred an indirect oxidation\
        \ of sulphides in the tailings through the coupled reactions of ferrous oxidation\
        \ and nitrate reduction which may occur in an anoxic layer. Diverse ferroxidases\
        \ were detected in all the MAGs (Table 2), indicating intensive microbial\
        \ activities to regenerate ferric which is a strong oxidant for sulphide dissolution.\
        \ Additionally, a full set of denitrification genes (nar, nir, nor, nos) were\
        \ detected in the Thioalkalivibrio sp. and Thiobacillus sp. MAGs. It has been\
        \ determined that total nitrogen is extremely low (< 0.006%) in the tailings\
        \ and most of this is in the form of microbial biomass (50-100%). There is\
        \ the possibility that anaerobic microbial sulphide oxidation has occurred\
        \ here with nitrate as electron acceptor. Other studies showed that pyrite\
        \ minerals of nano-size were oxidized by Thiobacillus denitrificans with nitrate\
        \ as electron acceptor. Sulphides in the tailings used in this study may favor\
        \ this indirect pathway due to their texture dominated by fine silt when nitrate\
        \ is present. This claim about the role of nitrate in sulfide oxidation requires\
        \ experimental verification in purposely designed physiological tests.\\n\\\
        nNitrogen deficiency is a common problem in tailings limiting plant growth,\
        \ and its microbial cycling has not been well studied for neutral/alkaline\
        \ metal tailings. Our results highlight the possibility of nitrate-depletion\
        \ by microbial sulphides oxidation as well as by CO oxidation in the tailings.\
        \ Nitrogen fixing mechanisms in the tailings remains largely unknown. The\
        \ key nitrogen fixing genes were not detected, with only nifU present in the\
        \ Rubrobacter sp. and Acidimicrobium sp. MAGs.\\n\\nPublisher's Note\\n\\\

              **Abstract:**

              Nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (NFLE) is a focal epilepsy with seizures
              arising mainly during sleep and characterized by complex, often bizarre,
              motor behavior or sustained dystonic posturing. First described in 1981,
              it was initially considered a motor disorder of sleep and was named
              nocturnal paroxysmal dystonia (NPD). The unusual seizure semiology,
              onset during sleep, and often uninformative scalp EEG and brain MRI
              make it difficult to distinguish NPD attacks from other non-epileptic
              nocturnal paroxysmal events, namely parasomnias. The long-debated epileptic
              origin of the condition was finally demonstrated in 1990 and the term
              NFLE introduced. Even though many aspects of parasomnias and NFLE have
              been clarified in the last two decades, the differential diagnosis remains
              a challenge for clinicians. To address controversial issues and define
              the diagnostic criteria for NFLE, a Consensus Conference was held in
              Bologna, Italy in 2014. Major points of agreement emerged on: (i) the
              relationship of the seizures with sleep and not with the circadian pattern
              of seizure occurrence; (ii) the possible extrafrontal origin of hypermotor
              seizures, without substantial differences in seizure semiology. In the
              wake of the Consensus, the syndrome was renamed Sleep-Related Hypermotor
              Epilepsy (SHE).

              **Abstract:**

              Nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (NFLE) is a focal epilepsy with seizures
              arising mainly during sleep and characterized by complex, often bizarre,
              motor behavior or sustained dystonic posturing. First described in 1981,
              it was initially considered a motor disorder of sleep and was named
              nocturnal paroxysmal dystonia (NPD). The unusual seizure semiology,
              onset during sleep, and often uninformative scalp EEG and brain MRI
              make it difficult to distinguish NPD attacks from other non-epileptic
              nocturnal paroxysmal events, namely parasomnias. The long-debated epileptic
              origin of the condition was finally demonstrated in 1990 and the term
              NFLE introduced. Even though many aspects of parasomnias and NFLE have
              been clarified in the last two decades, the differential diagnosis remains
              a challenge for clinicians. To address controversial issues and define
              the diagnostic criteria for NFLE, a Consensus Conference was held in
              Bologna, Italy in 2014. Major points of agreement emerged on: (i) the
              relationship of the seizures with sleep and not with the circadian pattern
              of seizure occurrence; (ii) the possible extrafrontal origin of hypermotor
              seizures, without substantial differences in seizure semiology. In the
              wake of the Consensus, the syndrome was renamed Sleep-Related Hypermotor
              Epilepsy (SHE).

              \ compare the phenotypic complexities of two viruses, the bacteriophage\
              \ X174 and vesicular stomatitis virus, and to illustrate the consistency\

  reason: The actual output does not contain any of the expected text and does not
    attempt to reproduce the first sentence of the Microarray Analysis section. Instead,
    it provides an error message about a missing file, which is unrelated to the expected
    output. There is no verbatim or paraphrased match, and none of the evaluation

              **Abstract:**

              Nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (NFLE) is a focal epilepsy with seizures
              arising mainly during sleep and characterized by complex, often bizarre,
              motor behavior or sustained dystonic posturing. First described in 1981,
              it was initially considered a motor disorder of sleep and was named
              nocturnal paroxysmal dystonia (NPD). The unusual seizure semiology,
              onset during sleep, and often uninformative scalp EEG and brain MRI
              make it difficult to distinguish NPD attacks from other non-epileptic
              nocturnal paroxysmal events, namely parasomnias. The long-debated epileptic
              origin of the condition was finally demonstrated in 1990 and the term
              NFLE introduced. Even though many aspects of parasomnias and NFLE have
              been clarified in the last two decades, the differential diagnosis remains
              a challenge for clinicians. To address controversial issues and define
              the diagnostic criteria for NFLE, a Consensus Conference was held in
              Bologna, Italy in 2014. Major points of agreement emerged on: (i) the
              relationship of the seizures with sleep and not with the circadian pattern
              of seizure occurrence; (ii) the possible extrafrontal origin of hypermotor
              seizures, without substantial differences in seizure semiology. In the
              wake of the Consensus, the syndrome was renamed Sleep-Related Hypermotor
              Epilepsy (SHE).

  reason: The response does not provide the expected publisher name ('Nature' or 'Nature

    with the evaluation steps.

              **Abstract:**

              To study the effect of plant species on the abundance and diversity
              of bacterial antagonists, the abundance, the phenotypic diversity, and
              the genotypic diversity of rhizobacteria isolated from potato, oilseed
              rape, and strawberry and from bulk soil which showed antagonistic activity
              towards the soilborne pathogen Verticillium dahliae Kleb. were analyzed.
              Rhizosphere and soil samples were taken five times over two growing
              seasons in 1998 and 1999 from a randomized field trial. Bacterial isolates
              were obtained after plating on R2A (Difco, Detroit, Mich.) or enrichment
              in microtiter plates containing high-molecular-weight substrates followed
              by plating on R2A. A total of 5,854 bacteria isolated from the rhizosphere
              of strawberry, potato, or oilseed rape or bulk soil from fallow were
              screened by dual testing for in vitro antagonism towards VERTICILLIUM:
              The proportion of isolates with antagonistic activity was highest for
              strawberry rhizosphere (9.5%), followed by oilseed rape (6.3%), potato
              (3.7%), and soil (3.3%). The 331 Verticillium antagonists were identified
              by their fatty acid methyl ester profiles. They were characterized by
              testing their in vitro antagonism against other pathogenic fungi; their
              glucanolytic, chitinolytic, and proteolytic activities; and their BOX-PCR
              fingerprints. The abundance and composition of Verticillium antagonists
              was plant species dependent. A rather high proportion of antagonists
              from the strawberry rhizosphere was identified as Pseudomonas putida
              B (69%), while antagonists belonging to the Enterobacteriaceae (Serratia
              spp., Pantoea agglomerans) were mainly isolated from the rhizosphere
              of oilseed rape. For P. putida A and B plant-specific genotypes were
              observed, suggesting that these bacteria were specifically enriched
              in each rhizosphere.

              \ on nanometre scales is an outstanding challenge in many areas of modern\
              \ science and technology. In particular, a thermometer capable of subdegree\
              \ temperature resolution over a large range of temperatures as well\
              \ as integration within a living system could provide a powerful new\
              \ tool in many areas of biological, physical and chemical research.\
              \ Possibilities range from the temperature-induced control of gene expression\
              \ and tumour metabolism to the cell-selective treatment of disease and\
              \ the study of heat dissipation in integrated circuits. By combining\
              \ local light-induced heat sources with sensitive nanoscale thermometry,\
              \ it may also be possible to engineer biological processes at the subcellular\
              \ level. Here we demonstrate a new approach to nanoscale thermometry\
              \ that uses coherent manipulation of the electronic spin associated\
              \ with nitrogen-vacancy colour centres in diamond. Our technique makes\
              \ it possible to detect temperature variations as small as 1.8\u2009\
              mK (a sensitivity of 9\u2009mK\u2009Hz(-1/2)) in an ultrapure bulk diamond\
              \ sample. Using nitrogen-vacancy centres in diamond nanocrystals (nanodiamonds),\
              \ we directly measure the local thermal environment on length scales\
              \ as short as 200\u2009nanometres. Finally, by introducing both nanodiamonds\
              \ and gold nanoparticles into a single human embryonic fibroblast, we\
              \ demonstrate temperature-gradient control and mapping at the subcellular\
              \ level, enabling unique potential applications in life sciences.\n\n\

        \ probing of temperature variations on nanometre scales is an outstanding\
        \ challenge in many areas of modern science and technology. In particular,\
        \ a thermometer capable of subdegree temperature resolution over a large range\
        \ of temperatures as well as integration within a living system could provide\
        \ a powerful new tool in many areas of biological, physical and chemical research.\
        \ Possibilities range from the temperature-induced control of gene expression\
        \ and tumour metabolism to the cell-selective treatment of disease and the\
        \ study of heat dissipation in integrated circuits. By combining local light-induced\
        \ heat sources with sensitive nanoscale thermometry, it may also be possible\
        \ to engineer biological processes at the subcellular level. Here we demonstrate\
        \ a new approach to nanoscale thermometry that uses coherent manipulation\
        \ of the electronic spin associated with nitrogen-vacancy colour centres in\
        \ diamond. Our technique makes it possible to detect temperature variations\
        \ as small as 1.8\u2009mK (a sensitivity of 9\u2009mK\u2009Hz(-1/2)) in an\
        \ ultrapure bulk diamond sample. Using nitrogen-vacancy centres in diamond\
        \ nanocrystals (nanodiamonds), we directly measure the local thermal environment\
        \ on length scales as short as 200\u2009nanometres. Finally, by introducing\
        \ both nanodiamonds and gold nanoparticles into a single human embryonic fibroblast,\
        \ we demonstrate temperature-gradient control and mapping at the subcellular\
        \ level, enabling unique potential applications in life sciences.\n\n**Keywords:**\

              Epilepsy: A 35-year diagnostic challenge.**


              **Authors:**

              **Volume/Issue:** 44/N/A


              **Abstract:**

              Nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (NFLE) is a focal epilepsy with seizures
              arising mainly during sleep and characterized by complex, often bizarre,
              motor behavior or sustained dystonic posturing. First described in 1981,
              it was initially considered a motor disorder of sleep and was named
              nocturnal paroxysmal dystonia (NPD). The unusual seizure semiology,
              onset during sleep, and often uninformative scalp EEG and brain MRI
              make it difficult to distinguish NPD attacks from other non-epileptic
              nocturnal paroxysmal events, namely parasomnias. The long-debated epileptic
              origin of the condition was finally demonstrated in 1990 and the term
              NFLE introduced. Even though many aspects of parasomnias and NFLE have
              been clarified in the last two decades, the differential diagnosis remains
              a challenge for clinicians. To address controversial issues and define
              the diagnostic criteria for NFLE, a Consensus Conference was held in
              Bologna, Italy in 2014. Major points of agreement emerged on: (i) the
              relationship of the seizures with sleep and not with the circadian pattern
              of seizure occurrence; (ii) the possible extrafrontal origin of hypermotor
              seizures, without substantial differences in seizure semiology. In the
              wake of the Consensus, the syndrome was renamed Sleep-Related Hypermotor
              Epilepsy (SHE).

  reason: The output correctly mentions that the paper is retracted and advises caution
    regarding the reliability of its findings, fulfilling steps 2 and 3. However,
    it incorrectly states that the microbes show oxidative stress resistance, which
    contradicts the paper's actual finding (step 1), and does not clearly state that
    the paper found no oxidative stresses. Paraphrasing is acceptable, but the key
    finding is misrepresented, resulting in a partial alignment with the evaluation
    steps.
  actual_output: 'The article titled **"Metagenome-assembled genomes infer potential
    microbial metabolism in alkaline sulphidic tailings"** published in the journal
    "Environmental Microbiome" provides insights into the microbial metabolism in
    alkaline sulphidic tailings. Here is a summary related to your inquiry:


    ### Key Findings:

    - The study successfully detected viable bacterial and archaeal cells in alkaline
    sulphidic tailings from Mt Isa, Queensland.

    - Using metagenomic techniques, the study reconstructed the microbial community
    structure and potential coupled iron and nitrogen metabolism pathways.

    - The assembly resulted in 10 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), with five nearly
    complete.

    - The dominant microbial species were observed to have powerful resistance systems
    for various stresses, including osmotic, metal, and oxidative stresses.

    - These microbial communities also exhibited capabilities for sulphide oxidation
    and contributed to increased salinity, metal release, and nitrogen depletion.


    ### Reliability of Findings:

    - The article indicates that these microbes indeed show oxidative stress resistance
    capabilities among other stress responses.

    - However, it''s important to note that this publication is marked as a **retracted
    publication**, which typically raises concerns about the reliability of its findings
    and conclusions. Retractions can occur for various reasons, including errors in
    the data, issues with experimental design, or ethical concerns.


    For further consideration, you might want to review any related discussion or
    follow-up research on this topic to gain a clearer insight into the findings''
    validity post-retraction. You can access the article via its DOI link provided:

              **Abstract:**

              BACKGROUND: Mine tailings are hostile environment. It has been well
              documented that several microbes can inhabit such environment, and metagenomic
              reconstruction has successfully pinpointed their activities and community
              structure in acidic tailings environments. We still know little about
              the microbial metabolic capacities of alkaline sulphidic environment
              where microbial processes are critically important for the revegetation.
              Microbial communities therein may not only provide soil functions, but
              also ameliorate the environment stresses for plants'' survival. RESULTS:
              In this study, we detected a considerable amount of viable bacterial
              and archaeal cells using fluorescent in situ hybridization in alkaline
              sulphidic tailings from Mt Isa, Queensland. By taking advantage of high-throughput
              sequencing and up-to-date metagenomic binning technology, we reconstructed
              the microbial community structure and potential coupled iron and nitrogen
              metabolism pathways in the tailings. Assembly of 10 metagenome-assembled
              genomes (MAGs), with 5 nearly complete, was achieved. From this, detailed
              insights into the community metabolic capabilities was derived. Dominant
              microbial species were seen to possess powerful resistance systems for
              osmotic, metal and oxidative stresses. Additionally, these community
              members had metabolic capabilities for sulphide oxidation, for causing
              increased salinity and metal release, and for leading to N depletion.
              CONCLUSIONS: Here our results show that a considerable amount of microbial
              cells inhabit the mine tailings, who possess a variety of genes for
              stress response. Metabolic reconstruction infers that the microbial
              consortia may actively accelerate the sulphide weathering and N depletion
              therein.
