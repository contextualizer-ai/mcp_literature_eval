              frontal lobe epilepsy (NFLE) is a focal epilepsy with seizures arising
              mainly during sleep and characterized by complex, often bizarre, motor
              behavior or sustained dystonic posturing. First described in 1981, it
              was initially considered a motor disorder of sleep and was named nocturnal
              paroxysmal dystonia (NPD). The unusual seizure semiology, onset during
              sleep, and often uninformative scalp EEG and brain MRI make it difficult
              to distinguish NPD attacks from other non-epileptic nocturnal paroxysmal
              events, namely parasomnias. The long-debated epileptic origin of the
              condition was finally demonstrated in 1990 and the term NFLE introduced.
              Even though many aspects of parasomnias and NFLE have been clarified
              in the last two decades, the differential diagnosis remains a challenge
              for clinicians. To address controversial issues and define the diagnostic
              criteria for NFLE, a Consensus Conference was held in Bologna, Italy
              in 2014. Major points of agreement emerged on: (i) the relationship
              of the seizures with sleep and not with the circadian pattern of seizure
              occurrence; (ii) the possible extrafrontal origin of hypermotor seizures,
              without substantial differences in seizure semiology. In the wake of
              the Consensus, the syndrome was renamed Sleep-Related Hypermotor Epilepsy
              (SHE).","affiliation":"IRCCS Institute of Neurological Sciences, Bologna,

        frontal lobe epilepsy (NFLE) is a focal epilepsy with seizures arising mainly
        during sleep and characterized by complex, often bizarre, motor behavior or
        sustained dystonic posturing. First described in 1981, it was initially considered
        a motor disorder of sleep and was named nocturnal paroxysmal dystonia (NPD).
        The unusual seizure semiology, onset during sleep, and often uninformative
        scalp EEG and brain MRI make it difficult to distinguish NPD attacks from
        other non-epileptic nocturnal paroxysmal events, namely parasomnias. The long-debated
        epileptic origin of the condition was finally demonstrated in 1990 and the
        term NFLE introduced. Even though many aspects of parasomnias and NFLE have
        been clarified in the last two decades, the differential diagnosis remains
        a challenge for clinicians. To address controversial issues and define the
        diagnostic criteria for NFLE, a Consensus Conference was held in Bologna,
        Italy in 2014. Major points of agreement emerged on: (i) the relationship
        of the seizures with sleep and not with the circadian pattern of seizure occurrence;
        (ii) the possible extrafrontal origin of hypermotor seizures, without substantial
        differences in seizure semiology. In the wake of the Consensus, the syndrome
        was renamed Sleep-Related Hypermotor Epilepsy (SHE).","affiliation":"IRCCS

        frontal lobe epilepsy (NFLE) is a focal epilepsy with seizures arising mainly
        during sleep and characterized by complex, often bizarre, motor behavior or
        sustained dystonic posturing. First described in 1981, it was initially considered
        a motor disorder of sleep and was named nocturnal paroxysmal dystonia (NPD).
        The unusual seizure semiology, onset during sleep, and often uninformative
        scalp EEG and brain MRI make it difficult to distinguish NPD attacks from
        other non-epileptic nocturnal paroxysmal events, namely parasomnias. The long-debated
        epileptic origin of the condition was finally demonstrated in 1990 and the
        term NFLE introduced. Even though many aspects of parasomnias and NFLE have
        been clarified in the last two decades, the differential diagnosis remains
        a challenge for clinicians. To address controversial issues and define the
        diagnostic criteria for NFLE, a Consensus Conference was held in Bologna,
        Italy in 2014. Major points of agreement emerged on: (i) the relationship
        of the seizures with sleep and not with the circadian pattern of seizure occurrence;
        (ii) the possible extrafrontal origin of hypermotor seizures, without substantial
        differences in seizure semiology. In the wake of the Consensus, the syndrome
        was renamed Sleep-Related Hypermotor Epilepsy (SHE).","affiliation":"IRCCS

  reason: The response does not contradict any facts from the expected output, but
    it fails to provide the required three levels of certainty for SHE ('witnessed,
    video-documented, Video-EEG documented'). Instead, it focuses on the inability
    to access the full text and offers general background information. This omission
    of key details is a significant shortcoming, though the answer does acknowledge

              frontal lobe epilepsy (NFLE) is a focal epilepsy with seizures arising
              mainly during sleep and characterized by complex, often bizarre, motor
              behavior or sustained dystonic posturing. First described in 1981, it
              was initially considered a motor disorder of sleep and was named nocturnal
              paroxysmal dystonia (NPD). The unusual seizure semiology, onset during
              sleep, and often uninformative scalp EEG and brain MRI make it difficult
              to distinguish NPD attacks from other non-epileptic nocturnal paroxysmal
              events, namely parasomnias. The long-debated epileptic origin of the
              condition was finally demonstrated in 1990 and the term NFLE introduced.
              Even though many aspects of parasomnias and NFLE have been clarified
              in the last two decades, the differential diagnosis remains a challenge
              for clinicians. To address controversial issues and define the diagnostic
              criteria for NFLE, a Consensus Conference was held in Bologna, Italy
              in 2014. Major points of agreement emerged on: (i) the relationship
              of the seizures with sleep and not with the circadian pattern of seizure
              occurrence; (ii) the possible extrafrontal origin of hypermotor seizures,
              without substantial differences in seizure semiology. In the wake of
              the Consensus, the syndrome was renamed Sleep-Related Hypermotor Epilepsy
              (SHE).","affiliation":"IRCCS Institute of Neurological Sciences, Bologna,

  reason: The response does not contradict any facts from the expected output, but
    it fails to provide the requested citation or the title of the cited paper, which
    is a significant omission of detail. Instead, it discusses access limitations
    and provides general context about the paper, but does not answer the core question.
    The only partial alignment is mentioning the review paper's title, but not the
    citation for the specific claim.

    text with references:

    The paper doesn''t appear to have open access full text available through Europe
    PMC. However, I can see from the metadata that this is a review paper titled **"From
    nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy to Sleep-Related Hypermotor Epilepsy: A 35-year
    diagnostic challenge"** by Tinuper P and Bisulli F, published in Seizure journal
    in 2017.


    The claim you mentioned - "The clinical spectrum of NFLS comprises distinct paroxysmal
    sleep-related attacks of variable duration and complexity" - appears to be referring
    to Nocturnal Frontal Lobe Epilepsy (NFLE), which was later renamed to Sleep-Related
    Hypermotor Epilepsy (SHE).


    Since I cannot access the full text with references due to subscription restrictions,
    I cannot directly identify the specific citation for that claim. The paper is
    a historical review covering 35 years of diagnostic evolution in this field, so
    it likely contains numerous citations supporting various claims about the clinical
    spectrum.


    To find the specific citation you''re looking for, you would need to:


    1. Access the full paper through your institution''s subscription to Seizure journal

    2. Look for the sentence containing that exact quote

    3. Check the corresponding reference number in that section


    Would you like me to help you in any other way, such as searching for related
    papers on this topic or looking up information about the authors'' other work
    in this field?'

      A 35-year diagnostic challenge"** by Tinuper P and Bisulli F, published in Seizure
      journal in 2017.


      The claim you mentioned - "The clinical spectrum of NFLS comprises distinct

      to be referring to Nocturnal Frontal Lobe Epilepsy (NFLE), which was later renamed

      I cannot directly identify the specific citation for that claim. The paper is
      a historical review covering 35 years of diagnostic evolution in this field,

              frontal lobe epilepsy (NFLE) is a focal epilepsy with seizures arising
              mainly during sleep and characterized by complex, often bizarre, motor
              behavior or sustained dystonic posturing. First described in 1981, it
              was initially considered a motor disorder of sleep and was named nocturnal
              paroxysmal dystonia (NPD). The unusual seizure semiology, onset during
              sleep, and often uninformative scalp EEG and brain MRI make it difficult
              to distinguish NPD attacks from other non-epileptic nocturnal paroxysmal
              events, namely parasomnias. The long-debated epileptic origin of the
              condition was finally demonstrated in 1990 and the term NFLE introduced.
              Even though many aspects of parasomnias and NFLE have been clarified
              in the last two decades, the differential diagnosis remains a challenge
              for clinicians. To address controversial issues and define the diagnostic
              criteria for NFLE, a Consensus Conference was held in Bologna, Italy
              in 2014. Major points of agreement emerged on: (i) the relationship
              of the seizures with sleep and not with the circadian pattern of seizure
              occurrence; (ii) the possible extrafrontal origin of hypermotor seizures,
              without substantial differences in seizure semiology. In the wake of
              the Consensus, the syndrome was renamed Sleep-Related Hypermotor Epilepsy

    the core requirement of supplying the first sentence of the last paragraph before
    the Conflict of Interest statement. The explanation of access limitations is accurate,
    but the omission of the requested detail warrants a heavy penalty.

    It seems the full text content is not available through Europe PMC for this DOI.
    Let me first check what metadata and identifiers are available for this paper:

    I can see this is a paper titled "From nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy to Sleep-Related
    Hypermotor Epilepsy: A 35-year diagnostic challenge" by Tinuper P and Bisulli
    F, published in Seizure journal in 2017. However, the full text content is not
    available through Europe PMC as it requires a subscription and is not open access.


    Unfortunately, I cannot access the full text of this paper through the available
    tools since it''s behind a paywall and not available as open access content in
    Europe PMC. The paper is published in the journal "Seizure" and would require
    institutional access or subscription to retrieve the complete text including the
    specific paragraph you''re asking about.


    To find the first sentence of the last paragraph before the Conflict of Interest
    statement, you would need to access the paper through:

    - Your institution''s library database access

    - Direct subscription to the journal

    - The publisher''s website (Elsevier) with appropriate access

    - A legitimate academic database that has full-text access to this journal


    Is there anything else I can help you with regarding this paper''s available metadata,
    or would you like me to search for related open-access papers on the same topic?'

              frontal lobe epilepsy (NFLE) is a focal epilepsy with seizures arising
              mainly during sleep and characterized by complex, often bizarre, motor
              behavior or sustained dystonic posturing. First described in 1981, it
              was initially considered a motor disorder of sleep and was named nocturnal
              paroxysmal dystonia (NPD). The unusual seizure semiology, onset during
              sleep, and often uninformative scalp EEG and brain MRI make it difficult
              to distinguish NPD attacks from other non-epileptic nocturnal paroxysmal
              events, namely parasomnias. The long-debated epileptic origin of the
              condition was finally demonstrated in 1990 and the term NFLE introduced.
              Even though many aspects of parasomnias and NFLE have been clarified
              in the last two decades, the differential diagnosis remains a challenge
              for clinicians. To address controversial issues and define the diagnostic
              criteria for NFLE, a Consensus Conference was held in Bologna, Italy
              in 2014. Major points of agreement emerged on: (i) the relationship
              of the seizures with sleep and not with the circadian pattern of seizure
              occurrence; (ii) the possible extrafrontal origin of hypermotor seizures,
              without substantial differences in seizure semiology. In the wake of

              \ with Gluconobacter oxydans\\n\\n**Authors:** Joseph J. Lee, Luke Plante,\
              \ Brooke Pian, Sabrina Marecos, Sean A. Medin, Jacob D. Klug, Matthew\
              \ C. Reid, Greeshma Gadikota, Esteban Gazel, Buz Barstow\\n\\n## Abstract\\\
              n\\nUltramafic rocks are an abundant source of cations for CO2 mineralization\
              \ (e.g., Mg) and elements for sustainability technologies (e.g., Ni,\
              \ Cr, Mn, Co, Al). However, there is no industrially useful process\
              \ for dissolving ultramafic materials to release cations for CO2 sequestration\
              \ or mining them for energy-critical elements. Weathering of ultramafic\
              \ rocks by rainwater, release of metal cations, and subsequent CO2 mineralization\
              \ already naturally sequesters CO2 from the atmosphere, but this natural\
              \ process will take thousands to hundreds of thousands of years to remove\
              \ excess anthropogenic CO2, far too late to deal with global warming\
              \ that will happen over the next century. Mechanical acceleration of\
              \ weathering by grinding can accelerate cation release but is prohibitively\
              \ expensive. In this article we show that gluconic acid-based lixiviants\
              \ produced by the mineral-dissolving microbe Gluconobacter oxydans accelerate\
              \ leaching of Mg2+ by 20\xD7 over deionized water, and that leaching\
              \ of Mg, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni further improves by 73% from 24 to 96 h.\
              \ At low pulp density (1%) the G. oxydans biolixiviant is only 6% more\
              \ effective than gluconic acid. But, at 60% pulp density the G. oxydans\
              \ biolixiviant is 3.2\xD7 more effective than just gluconic acid. We\
              \ demonstrate that biolixiviants made with cellulosic hydrolysate are\
              \ not significantly worse than biolixiviants made with glucose, dramatically\
              \ improving the feedstock available for bioleaching. Finally, we demonstrate\
              \ that we can reduce the number of carbon atoms in the biolixiviant\
              \ feedstock (e.g., glucose or cellulosic hydrolysate) needed to release\
              \ one Mg2+ ion and mineralize one atom of carbon from CO2 from 525 to\
              \ 1.\\n## Supplementary Information\\nThe online version contains supplementary\

              n\\nThe accumulation of over a trillion tonnes of anthropogenic CO2\
              \ in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere1\u20134 driving global climate change\
              \ is one of the most pressing challenges of our time. To address this,\
              \ the IPCC\u2019s Special Report in 2018 stresses the necessity of deploying\
              \ carbon dioxide removal (CDR) technology capable of removing tens of\
              \ gigatonnes of CO2 from the atmosphere annually, paired with carbon-neutral\
              \ energy technologies to prevent global warming from exceeding 1.5\u02DA\
              C above pre-industrial levels5.\\n\\nMineralization of CO2 is a highly\
              \ attractive approach for permanent sequestration of CO2, as it converts\
              \ atmospheric carbon into solid minerals as a permanent sink6,7. Carbon\
              \ mineralization proceeds through a two-step process. First, ultramafic\
              \ rocks are dissolved by weathering to release magnesium cations (Note\
              \ S1). In the second step, magnesium ions are reacted with dissolved\
              \ carbonate to form magnesite (MgCO3), a stable mineral that permanently\
              \ stores CO28 (Note S1). A schematic of a proposed indirect carbonation\
              \ method is shown in Fig. 1.Fig. 1Proposed system for bio-accelerated\
              \ weathering of ultramafic materials for carbon mineralization. This\
              \ work focuses on the rate-limiting step, the metal leaching stage (enclosed\
              \ in red box), where G. oxydans biolixiviant leaches magnesium ions\
              \ and other metals from dunite. Downstream carbonation results in magnesite\
              \ formation for CO2 storage, and metal recovery done chemically or electrochemically\
              \ can extract energy-critical metals for commercial use.\\n\\nNaturally\
              \ occurring weathering of ultramafic rocks and subsequent carbon mineralization\
              \ is thought to be responsible for removal of up to hundreds of millions\
              \ of tonnes of CO2 each year8\u201311. In fact, because ultramafic rocks\
              \ are so abundant12,13, reaction of all of the metal cations in all\
              \ surface-accessible ultramafic material could capture 100 trillion\
              \ tonnes of CO2 as carbonate minerals14 (at least 58\xD7 the excess\
              \ CO2 in the atmosphere), making them a strong candidate for gigatonne-scale\
              \ CDR15,8,16. However, natural carbon mineralization is partially offset\
              \ by oxidation of rock organic carbon11,17. As a result, the time to\
              \ naturally regulate atmospheric CO2 levels is estimated to be between\
              \ tens and hundreds of thousands of years8,11,18\u201320.\\n\\nThe large-scale\
              \ deployment of carbon-neutral energy technologies will also be necessary\
              \ to control climate change5, but it will require vast quantities of\
              \ metals21. In addition to metal cations needed for CO2 sequestration,\
              \ ultramafic minerals are a potential low-grade ore source for energy-critical\
              \ metals such as nickel (batteries and stainless steel), chromium (concentrated\
              \ solar and geothermal energy), manganese (steel and batteries), cobalt\
              \ (batteries), and copper (wiring and wind turbines)8,21\u201325 (Figure\
              \ S2, Tables S1 and S2). This presents an opportunity to extract energy-critical\
              \ metals from ultramafic rock while sequestering CO2.\\n\\nHowever,\
              \ extracting metals from ultramafic rocks poses a significant challenge.\
              \ In aqueous mineral carbonation, the rate of carbon mineralization\
              \ is limited by the slow kinetics of the leaching of metal ions from\
              \ ultramafic sources14,26,27. While mechanical acceleration of ultramafic\
              \ weathering through crushing, grinding, heating, chemically treating,\
              \ and spreading over land is promising for its high sequestration potential\
              \ and improved kinetics8,16,28\u201330, it requires large area footprints\
              \ and high energy inputs involved in crushing, grinding, heating, and\
              \ pressurizing, making it prohibitively expensive31. Likewise, technologies\
              \ to extract the energy-critical elements present in low concentration\
              \ in ultramafic rocks present formidable economic and environmental\
              \ challenges24,32,33.\\n\\nWe hypothesize that microbially-accelerated\
              \ mineral dissolution could overcome the slow kinetics and high costs14\
              \ of the dissolution of ultramafic material, releasing magnesium ions\
              \ at a rate several orders of magnitude greater than in nature34,35.\
              \ Over the past two decades, microbial mineral dissolution has revolutionized\
              \ mining copper and gold from low-grade ores\u2014a process known as\
              \ biomining. Bacteria such as Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans and related\
              \ species are responsible for producing about 15% of the world\u2019\
              s copper supply and about 5% of its gold supply36 through iron-redox-mediated\
              \ bioleaching, a process in which microbes alter the redox state of\
              \ metals to extract them from mineral substrates37,38. Significant research\
              \ has been performed to improve industrial-scale Cu bioleaching with\
              \ consortia including A. ferrooxidans and non-domesticated microbes,\
              \ resulting in processes that are fairly mature. While copper biomining\
              \ is the only industrialized biomining process, organisms and processes\
              \ are in development for rare earth elements (REE)39\u201344 and lithium45,46.\\\
              n\\nBiolixiviants produced by Gluconobacter oxydans are a strong candidate\
              \ for a sustainable and strong catalyst for CO2 mineralization using\
              \ ultramafic rocks11,47. A recent study from our team comparing the\
              \ dunite dissolution performance of three mineral-dissolving microbes,\
              \ Gluconobacter oxydans, Sphingomonas desiccabilis, and Penicillium\
              \ simplicissimum, concludes that G. oxydans outperformed the other two\
              \ in the extraction of all metals from dunite11.\\n\\nG. oxydans efficiently\
              \ produces a gluconic acid-based mineral-dissolving solution, called\
              \ a biolixiviant, when glucose is present47,48. Previous studies have\
              \ shown that biolixiviants from G. oxydans can be more effective than\
              \ just gluconic acid at leaching REE42,49. In a recent article, our\
              \ team identified genes that control the effectiveness of the G. oxydans\
              \ biolixiviant at dissolving neodymium phosphate (synthetic monazite)\
              \ but do not notably change its pH50. These results suggest that biologically-produced\
              \ lixiviants could contain additional components, such as metal chelators,\
              \ redox molecules, and flavins that improve overall metal leaching at\
              \ fixed pH, allowing for more efficient and low-resource metal leaching.\
              \ This could avoid the use of strong acids that can have harmful environmental\
              \ effects such as acid mine drainage51.\\n\\nSecond, it is suspected\
              \ that microbes interact with ultramafic materials in the wild, accelerating\
              \ weathering processes52\u201355. Furthermore, laboratory mixed cultures\
              \ have been shown to dissolve ultramafic material56. Meanwhile, in two\
              \ companion articles, we demonstrate that three easily culturable isolated\
              \ species (G. oxydans, Penicillium simplicissimum and Sphingomonas desiccabilis)\
              \ can all accelerate the dissolution of ultramafic material11 and characterize\
              \ mineral phase transformations due to bioleaching by G. oxydans57.\\\
              n\\nHowever, there has been little systematic study of microbial dissolution\
              \ of ultramafic minerals. Furthermore, it remains unclear under what\
              \ conditions a biolixiviant could be more effective than just an organic\
              \ acid and why; could genetic engineering improve ultramafic bioleaching;\
              \ what impact process parameters have on biological dissolution of ultramafic\
              \ materials; the extraction efficiencies for energy critical elements;\
              \ utilization of low-cost feedstock; and the carbon source demand of\
              \ large-scale ultramafic bioleaching. To address these knowledge gaps,\
              \ we provide some of the first systematic observations of dissolution\
              \ of ultramafic minerals by the mineral-dissolving microbe, G. oxydans\
              \ B58.\\n\\n## Results and discussion\\n\\nIn this work, we perform\
              \ a study of G. oxydans bioleaching capability on dunite, an ultramafic\
              \ rock composed of greater than 90% olivine (see composition in Figure\
              \ S2, and Tables S1 and S2). For accelerated weathering technologies,\
              \ olivine-rich dunite is the preferred feedstock due to olivine having\
              \ the highest CO2 sequestration potential by mass, excellent carbonation\
              \ kinetics, and high abundance58,59.\\n\\nThis study benchmarks the\
              \ bioleaching efficacy of glucose-based and lignocellulosic sugar-based\
              \ biolixiviants produced by G. oxydans on dunite, comparing conditions\
              \ of whole-cell and filtered (cell-free) biolixiviants, varying pulp\
              \ densities, aerobic and anaerobic conditions, and short-term and long-term\
              \ leaching. This study also investigates how a high-performing mutant\
              \ strain of G. oxydans could improve leaching in ultramafic minerals,\
              \ serving as a preliminary study of how genetic engineering could further\
              \ improve bioleaching for carbon mineralization. We demonstrate that\
              \ the effectiveness advantage of the G. oxydans biolixiviant over gluconic\
              \ acid alone grows with increasing pulp density. Finally, we demonstrate\
              \ that the number of carbon atoms that need to be supplied by sugar\
              \ feedstocks can be reduced to match the number of carbon atoms potentially\
              \ sequestered as a mineral.\\n\\n### G. oxydans biolixiviants accelerate\
              \ magnesium and energy-critical metal leaching by 20\xD7 over deionized\
              \ water after 24 h\\n\\nBiolixiviants from wild-type Gluconobacter oxydans\

              \ concentrations in the leachate and the original concentration in the\

              n\\nDeionized water is used as a control for these experiments since\
              \ it estimates the improvements made by bio-accelerated leaching to\
              \ leaching from environmental water sources, such as rainwater. In traditional\
              \ accelerated carbon mineralization with ultramafic rocks, crushed rocks\
              \ are dispersed over land, where water from the environment is the solvent\
              \ for magnesium8,29,30. Comparing the concentrations of magnesium between\
              \ leaching with biolixiviants and water provides a rough estimate for\
              \ the order of magnitude in which carbon mineralization is accelerated\
              \ by G. oxydans.\\n\\nAfter 24 h of leaching with dunite at 1% pulp\
              \ density, magnesium was leached with an extraction efficiency of 11%\
              \ (300 ppm), corresponding to an increase of 20\xD7 when compared to\
              \ the deionized water control (Fig. 2A). The pH of wild-type biolixiviants\
              \ was 2.39 \xB1 0.02 across all experiments using wild-type biolixiviants.\
              \ At the start of each leaching experiment, the initial concentrations\
              \ of all metals in biolixiviants and controls are below detection limits.\
              \ Figure S3 shows how the metal concentrations in controls and G. oxydans\
              \ leachates diverge within the first few hours of leaching, starting\
              \ with initial metal concentrations of zero.Fig. 2Leaching dunite at\
              \ 1% pulp density with wild-type (WT)G. oxydans biolixiviant improves\
              \ leaching of magnesium by 20-fold when compared to leaching with deionized\
              \ water (control). However, the G. oxydans biolixiviant is only 6% better\
              \ than just gluconic acid at the same pH. Bioleaching of dunite at 1%\

              \ metal leaching compared to gluconic acid across all metals. Stars\
              \ denote significant difference between gluconic acid leaching and wild-type\
              \ biolixiviant leaching by a Welch\u2019s two-sample t-test, where,\

              \ of metals byG. oxydans increases by 73% from 24 to 96 h\\n\\nThe most\
              \ efficiently extracted metal at 24 h was Mn (Fig. 2B), extracting over\
              \ 15% of Mn from dunite (corresponding to a leachate concentration of\
              \ 1.6 ppm). Fe, Co, and Ni were also leached highly, with efficiencies\
              \ between 11% and 15% (Figs. 2C, D, and E, respectively). Al and Cr\
              \ were also leached, but much less efficiently (Figure S4). Cr was the\
              \ least efficiently extracted metal, with extraction of no more than\
              \ 0.3% under any condition (Figure S4 right column). We speculate that\
              \ chromium is significantly less leached since the chromite inclusions\
              \ within dunite are relatively more stable than olivine and resistant\
              \ to acid dissolution60.\\n\\nWhen leaching for longer than 24 h, bioleaching\
              \ efficiency continues to increase (Fig. 3). In a 96-hour bioleaching\
              \ analysis of dunite at 1% pulp density, bioleaching increased between\
              \ 24 and 96 h by an average of 73% for Mg, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni (Fig.\
              \ 3). After 96 h, the leaching of magnesium in biolixiviant is 42 times\
              \ that of water (Fig. 3). This shows that biolixiviants from G. oxydans\
              \ improve the overall leaching of metals at a rate faster than water.Fig.\
              \ 3Increasing leaching time to 96 h increases extraction efficiency\
              \ by an average of 73% between 24 and 96 h for Mg, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni.\
              \ Biolixiviants from wild-type G. oxydans leached dunite at 1% pulp\
              \ density for 96 h, shaking at 22 \xB0C. Mg, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni concentrations\
              \ were measured from leachates every 24 h for 96 h. Error bars indicate\
              \ standard deviation of measurements from duplicate measurements.\\\
              n\\n### TheG. oxydans biolixiviant is only 6% better than gluconic acid\
              \ at 1% pulp density\\n\\nA secondary control was performed using only\
              \ gluconic acid diluted with deionized water to the same pH as the acid\
              \ biolixiviants produced by G. oxydans. Reed et al.42 and Antonick et\
              \ al.49 demonstrated that biolixiviants produced by G. oxydans were\
              \ noticeably more effective at bioleaching than gluconic acid alone.\
              \ However, recent anecdotal evidence suggests this is not the case under\
              \ all conditions. In our hands, when bioleaching ultramafic materials\
              \ at low pulp density (1%), G. oxydans-produced biolixiviants only slightly\
              \ outperform gluconic acid in leaching most metals (Fig. 2). Wild-type\
              \ G. oxydans biolixiviants leached only 6% more magnesium compared to\
              \ pure gluconic acid that was diluted with ultrapure water to the same\
              \ pH after 24 h of leaching. Furthermore, at least with low pulp density\
              \ leaching, filtering cells from the biolixiviant did not significantly\
              \ affect bioleaching, at least under the conditions of these tests (Fig.\
              \ 4). This was done to assess if there was a significant residual effect\
              \ of microbial activity on leaching after biolixiviant production. Furthermore,\
              \ stoppering flasks during leaching to prevent gas exchange did not\
              \ significantly affect bioleaching (Figure S5). Later in the article,\
              \ we ask if there are conditions under which the G. oxydans biolixiviant\
              \ has a significant performance advantage for bioleaching ultramafic\
              \ materials.Fig. 4Filtering cells from theG. oxydans biolixiviant does\
              \ not notably reduce the bioleaching of metals from dunite after 24-hour\
              \ leaching. We compared Bioleaching of 1% dunite by sugar water (col.\
              \ 1), with whole cell lixiviant (col. 2), and with a biolixiviant that\
              \ was clarified by filtration with a 0.22 \u03BCm syringe filter (col.\
              \ 3). Filtered and unfiltered biolixiviants were at identical pH, produced\
              \ from duplicate colonies, and were added to ultramafic minerals in\
              \ identical conditions. Filtering biolixiviants before bioleaching resulted\
              \ in similar metal concentrations when compared to whole-cell biolixiviants\
              \ when leaching dunite. A Welch\u2019s two-sample t-test shows that\
              \ no significant difference was detected between the unfiltered and\
              \ filtered groups, with p-values ranging from 0.2 to 0.9. This indicates\
              \ that based on a 24-hour leaching study, the presence of G. oxydans\
              \ does not significantly improve or diminish the effect of the biolixiviant\
              \ on leaching in short term leaching.\\n\\n### Cellulosic hydrolysate\
              \ can be used as an alternative sugar feedstock for bioleaching\\n\\\
              nTechno-economic analysis shows that glucose feedstock for biolixiviant\
              \ production is the biggest cost driver in REE biomining with G. oxydans,\
              \ accounting for almost half of the total cost61. Furthermore, the sheer\
              \ scale that carbon sequestration needs to operate at, means that enormous\
              \ amounts of feedstock will be required, potentially placing a significant\
              \ demand on the world\u2019s biomass supply62.\\n\\nLignocellulose,\
              \ found in agricultural waste, can be a renewable carbon source for\
              \ microbial growth and production once monomeric sugars are released\
              \ through acid pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis, making a glucose-rich\
              \ cellulosic hydrolysate63,64. Lignocellulosic sugars are being increasingly\
              \ investigated as a potential alternative sugar source for several applications,\
              \ including biofuels/bioethanol production and substrates for cellular\
              \ production. Utilizing lignocellulose-derived sugars could serve as\
              \ a high glucose replacement feedstock that would greatly improve the\
              \ cost-efficiency of bioleaching for carbon capture technologies65,66.\
              \ G. oxydans has been shown to be able to convert the glucose and xylose\
              \ sugars in cellulosic hydrolysate into gluconic acid and xylonic acid\
              \ at extremely high efficiencies67\u201369. Replacing pure glucose with\
              \ cellulosic hydrolysate could further improve the economic and environmental\
              \ viability of bio-accelerated weathering.\\n\\nG. oxydans has been\
              \ shown to efficiently produce gluconic acid and xylonic acid from lignocellulosic\
              \ hydrolysate feedstocks67\u201369, making industrial-scale, bio-accelerated\
              \ carbon mineralization far more economically feasible. We investigated\
              \ if biolixiviants produced from cellulosic hydrolysate, rather than\
              \ pure glucose, could be effective at leaching dunite. The cellulosic\
              \ hydrolysate (CH) used in this study is a glucose-rich solution produced\
              \ from the enzymatic hydrolysis of concentrated corn stover (Table S3).\\\
              n\\nBiolixiviants produced from cellulosic hydrolysate were on average\
              \ 28% less effective in leaching magnesium compared to glucose-based\
              \ biolixiviants (Fig. 5). Leaching of Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni was also reduced\
              \ by an average of 52% compared to glucose-based biolixiviants (Fig.\
              \ 5). Dunite was added at 1% pulp density, and a leaching comparison\
              \ between CH-based and glucose-based lixiviants was conducted in parallel\
              \ and in identical conditions. The cellulosic hydrolysate added was\
              \ diluted with deionized water so that the total sugar concentrations\
              \ were equal to the amount of glucose added for glucose-based biolixiviants.Fig.\
              \ 5Use of cellulosic hydrolysate as a biolixiviant feedstock does not\
              \ considerably reduce bioleaching efficiency. Panels (A) to (E) show\
              \ comparison of bioleaching of Mg, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni by Gluconobacter\
              \ oxydans when using glucose and cellulosic hydrolysate (CH) as as biolixiviant\
              \ feedstock. CH-based biolixiviant leaches magnesium on average at 72%\
              \ the efficacy of glucose-based biolixiviant. Leaching was performed\
              \ with 1% dunite shaking at 22 \xB0C for 24 h. Stars denote significant\
              \ difference compared with glucose-based biolixiviants by a Welch\u2019\
              s two-sample t-test, where, p < 0.05 (*), p < 0.01 (**), p < 0.001 (***).\\\
              n\\nDespite a 28% average reduction in Mg leaching, we were unable to\
              \ detect a statistically meaningful difference between glucose- and\
              \ CH-based leaching of Mg using a Welch\u2019s two-sample t-test. This\
              \ was due to the small sample size and variability in CH-based biolixiviant\
              \ leachate measurements. Data collected for CH-based biolixiviants resulted\
              \ in greater variability than data with glucose-based biolixiviants.\
              \ ICP-MS analysis of cellulosic hydrolysate samples showed that the\
              \ CH used in this study contains trace concentrations of metals, possibly\
              \ as a result of the manufacturing process (Table S4). When calculating\
              \ the amounts of metal leached from CH-based biolixiviants, the concentrations\
              \ of metal in a cellulosic hydrolysate control study were subtracted\
              \ from the total detected to eliminate metal concentrations that were\
              \ not extracted from dunite. In low pulp density studies, the concentrations\
              \ of metals in the cellulosic hydrolysate feedstock interfered with\
              \ metals leached, resulting in higher overall error.\\n\\nCellulosic\
              \ hydrolysate produced from corn stover contains several toxins such\
              \ as organic acids, furan derivatives, and phenolic compounds that could\
              \ inhibit the growth of G. oxydans and its production of biolixiviant70.\
              \ Cellulosic hydrolysate also significantly increases viscosity, resulting\
              \ in lower oxygen transfer rates that limit the fermentation of glucose\
              \ to gluconic acid68. Despite this, leaching results show that G. oxydans\
              \ can produce a biolixiviant from cellulosic hydrolysate capable of\
              \ leaching metals at concentrations significantly greater than controls;\
              \ however, further analysis and experimentation are needed to show if\
              \ CH can be a viable replacement to glucose without a significant reduction\
              \ in performance.\\n\\nAlthough cellulosic hydrolysate contains mild\
              \ antibiotic properties due to its acidity and certain toxic compounds,\
              \ this could be advantageous for the industrial scale use of it as a\
              \ feedstock for biolixiviant production. G. oxydans has high acid resistance\
              \ and is capable of growing and producing biolixiviant with cellulosic\
              \ hydrolysate, while many other microbes have low tolerance mechanisms\
              \ for it. This could allow for cellulosic hydrolysate to be used as\
              \ an ultra-low-cost feedstock while also preventing the growth of competing\
              \ microbes. The toxic components of cellulosic hydrolysate could also\
              \ be a genetic engineering target for G. oxydans, where mutants that\
              \ have better resistance mechanisms can be selected for to improve biolixiviant\
              \ production.\\n\\n### G. oxydans mutant strain\u0394pstS, P112:mgdh\
              \ improved magnesium leaching by 12% over wild-type\\n\\nA preliminary\
              \ study using the mutant strain G. oxydans \u0394pstS, P112:mgdh43 shows\
              \ that under identical growth and leaching conditions, mutant strains\
              \ of G. oxydans can be more effective than wild-type in leaching magnesium\
              \ and energy-critical metals from dunite.\\n\\nA bioleaching analysis\
              \ over 96 h using dunite at 1% pulp density was conducted with biolixiviant\
              \ from wild-type and mutant G. oxydans. Bioleachate samples were taken\
              \ and analyzed every 24 h up to 96 h using ICP-MS. The strain used is\
              \ G. oxydans \u0394pstS, P112:mgdh, which was engineered to improve\
              \ acid production for metal leaching43. It contains a clean deletion\
              \ of the pstS gene which is involved in phosphate signaling and transport44,\
              \ and an up-regulation with promoter P112 of the mgdh gene (Membrane-bound\
              \ Glucose DeHydrogenase) which is critical for converting glucose into\
              \ gluconic acid71. The \u0394pstS, P112:mgdh mutant was previously shown\
              \ to decrease the pH of biolixiviants compared to wild-type, and it\
              \ increases the overall leaching of REE43. The biolixiviant produced\
              \ from the \u0394pstS, P112:mgdh mutant had a pH of 2.01 \xB1 0.02 across\
              \ all replicates, while the pH of wild-type biolixiviants were 2.39\
              \ \xB1 0.02.\\n\\nThe analysis shows that \u0394pstS, P112:mgdh mutant\
              \ biolixiviant increases magnesium leaching by an average of 12% over\
              \ all samples taken between 24 and 96 h of leaching. Mn, Fe, Co, and\
              \ Ni had an average improvement in leaching of 12% using mutant biolixiviant\
              \ compared to wild-type (Fig. 6).Fig. 6Bioleaching efficiency of magnesium\
              \ increased by an average of 12% when leaching with a high performingG.\

              \ the mgdh gene that codes for the Membrane-bound Glucose DeHydrogenase\

              \ of G. oxydans is yet to be completely characterized, and several other\
              \ genes may exist that are critical in controlling metal leaching from\
              \ ultramafic rocks. Future work to characterize the genome of G. oxydans\
              \ in terms of its functions related to ultramafic leaching is vital\
              \ to engineer better mutant strains that can improve the performance\
              \ of bio-accelerated weathering. The \u0394pstS, P112:mgdh mutant is\
              \ engineered to maximize gluconic acid production; however, studies\
              \ have shown that for rare earths leaching, G. oxydans mutants can be\
              \ screened to identify genes that specifically affect rare earth extraction50.\
              \ Our research group has created a quality-controlled (QC) whole genome\
              \ knockout collection for G. oxydans B58, containing a collection of\
              \ 2,733 transposon disruption mutants, each with a different nonessential\
              \ gene disrupted. This QC collection enables a high-throughput screen\
              \ of the G. oxydans genome, selecting for significant changes to dunite\
              \ leaching efficacy. This will provide us with a roadmap for genetically\

              \ than gluconic acid at 60% pulp density\\n\\nAt higher pulp densities\
              \ and longer leaching times, Gluconobacter oxydans biolixiviants significantly\
              \ outperformed gluconic acid at the same pH. We compared Gluconobacter\
              \ oxydans biolixiviants and gluconic acid metal leaching with 5%, 10%,\
              \ and 60% dunite pulp density, where leachate metal concentrations were\
              \ measured every 24 h for 72 h. The gluconic acid was diluted with ultrapure\
              \ deionized water to match the pH of biolixiviants, and leaching was\
              \ performed in identical conditions with the same mineral substrates\
              \ (DUN-2). After 72 h of leaching, wild-type biolixiviants leached 1.74\
              \ times more magnesium than gluconic acid from 5% dunite, 2.87 times\
              \ more from 10% dunite, and 3.25 times more from 60% dunite (Fig. 7).\
              \ At higher pulp densities, Gluconobacter oxydans biolixiviants exhibit\
              \ significantly higher leaching efficiency than gluconic acid. This\
              \ analysis suggests that metal leaching from dunite is not only controlled\
              \ by acidolysis, but might contain other biologically-synthesized components\
              \ that amplify extraction50.Fig. 7At 60% pulp density, the wild-typeG.\
              \ oxydans biolixiviant was 3.2\xD7 more effective at bioleaching dunite\
              \ than gluconic acid diluted to the same pH with pure water. A comparative\
              \ bioleaching study was conducted comparing the leaching efficacy of\
              \ wild-type G. oxydans biolixiviants and just gluconic acid at the same\

              \ and 72 h of leaching with 5% (A), 10% (B), and 60% (C) dunite (DUN-2).\
              \ At higher dunite pulp densities, the improvement of Gluconobacter\
              \ oxydans biolixiviants compared to gluconic acid was amplified. After\
              \ 72 h, biolixiviants were 74% better than gluconic acid at leaching\
              \ 5% dunite, 1.87 times better at leaching 10% dunite, and 2.25 times\
              \ better at leaching 60% dunite. Stars denote significant difference\

              \ is the price per unit mass of the feedstock.\\n\\nIn this work, we\
              \ succeeded in reducing kseq from 525 to 1.0 (almost 3 orders of magnitude)\
              \ (Fig. 8). With 1% dunite and 24 h of leaching, the approximate kseq\
              \ is 525 carbon invested/magnesium leached. One method to reduce kseq\
              \ is to increase the time of leaching. After 96 h of leaching, the magnesium\
              \ concentration increased by 81% when compared to 24 h leaching at the\
              \ same pulp density (Fig. 3). When increasing the time of leaching to\
              \ 10 days, the magnesium concentration improved by an average of 147%\
              \ (Fig. 8). Increasing the pulp density of dunite also reduces kseq.\
              \ When compared to 1% pulp density of dunite, increasing to 10% pulp\
              \ density resulted in a 5-fold increase in magnesium leaching after\
              \ 24 h (Fig. 8). When combining 10% pulp density with 10 days of leaching,\
              \ magnesium leaching increased by 9.2 times that of 1% pulp density\
              \ leached for 1 day (Fig. 8), resulting in a kseq of 57, since glucose\
              \ input remained unchanged. For the lowest kseq values achieved, fine-particle\
              \ dunite at a pulp density of 60% was leached for 19 days with three\
              \ different methods (Fig. 8 Leaching Attempts #12\u201314). The first\
              \ method (Fig. 8 Leaching Attempt #12) was direct addition of 60% dunite,\
              \ the second method (Leaching Attempt #13) was a 2-step dunite addition,\
              \ where 30% dunite was added on day 0 and another 30% added on day 10,\
              \ and the third method (Leaching Attempt #14) was a 2-step dunite addition\
              \ where the first 30% dunite feed was removed from the leachate before\
              \ the second 30% addition on day 10. All three leaching methods resulted\
              \ in a kseq equal to or less than 1.0, with the lowest kseq being 0.96\
              \ on Leaching Attempt #13 in Fig. 8.Fig. 8Process and genetic improvements\
              \ reduce the amount of feedstock carbon needed to potentially sequester\
              \ one CO2 molecule from 525 to 1. Increasing leaching time, pulp density,\
              \ and reducing average particle sizes were able to reduce kseq (glucose\
              \ carbon investment vs. carbon sequestration ratio) by several orders\
              \ of magnitude. Increasing dunite pulp density from 1\u201310% had a\
              \ larger impact in reducing kseq than increasing leaching time from\
              \ 1 to 10 days. Combining the \u0394pstS, P112:mdgh double mutant with\
              \ high pulp densities and long leaching times resulted in a kseq value\
              \ of 1 in three experiments (Col. 10\u201312). Leaching attempts #1\u2013\
              9 used DUN-1 and attempts #10\u201312 used DUN-3 with a particle size\
              \ of less than 74 microns as the leaching substrate.\\n\\nWhat implications\
              \ do these results have for CO2 sequestration? For kseq = 525, when\
              \ using glucose as a feedstock, the cost of sequestering 1 tonne of\
              \ CO2 is $358,000, a long way above the US Department of Energy\u2019\
              s (DOE) target of $100 per tonne72, and well above existing technologies31.\
              \ On the other hand, if we could reduce kseq to 1 (as in Fig. 8) at\
              \ industrial scale, the cost of carbon sequestration (at least the microbial\
              \ feedstock part of the cost) through bio-accelerated weathering starts\
              \ to become comparable to (still high) current technologies, at $682\
              \ per tonne31. If we could reduce kseq to 0.15 (about a 6-fold reduction\
              \ over our best attempt, much smaller than the reduction we achieved\
              \ in the course of writing this article) then we could reduce the feedstock\
              \ cost for sequestering 1 tonne of CO2 to $100. This would not account\
              \ for the costs of mining ultramafic material, but nor does it account\
              \ for the offset cost of energy-critical metal recovery. However, using\
              \ this to sequester 20 gigatonnes of CO2 a year5 would require 2 billion\
              \ tonnes of glucose, over 10 times current global annual sugar production73.\\\
              n\\nSugars derived from cellulosic biomass are potentially much more\
              \ abundant than glucose that is derived from cereal crops like corn,\
              \ sugar cane, and sugar beet74. While there is no widespread production\
              \ of cellulosic sugars today that is not immediately diverted to cellulosic\
              \ ethanol production, this could happen in the future. Furthermore,\
              \ it is estimated that cellulosic sugar production could be as low as\
              \ $100 per tonne75 (in contrast to around $1,000 per tonne for glucose).\
              \ Although cellulosic sugars are abundant, they are not limitless. Slade\
              \ et al.76, made estimates of global bioenergy supply, and concluded\
              \ that several tipping points would occur as the amount of biomass withdrawn\
              \ from the biosphere for bioenergy (or some other chemical production,\
              \ such as carbon sequestration) increased, forcing increasingly unpalatable\
              \ choices on global society including mass adoption of vegetarian diets,\
              \ mass deforestation, population control, or combinations thereof. Their\
              \ analysis suggests that the first global agricultural tipping point\
              \ (choosing one of the three unpalatable options) would occur when biomass\
              \ was withdrawn at a rate of around 7 gigatonnes per year62. Assuming\
              \ that cellulosic sugars are on average a 50:50 mix of C5 and C6 sugars,\
              \ then to reduce the cellulosic biomass demand to sequester 20 gigatonnes\
              \ of CO2 to 3.5 gigatonnes, kseq needs only to be reduced to 0.25.\\\
              n\\nAlthough kseq serves as a useful metric for displaying sugar investment\
              \ in terms of CO2 sequestration potential, it is only a theoretical\
              \ value whose real value will depend on the conversion rates of downstream\
              \ CO2 mineralization. Since glucose inputs are a major cost driver in\
              \ bio-accelerated weathering61, kseq can help estimate lower-limit costs\
              \ of scaled operations. Future scale-up work will be necessary to formulate\
              \ more accurate estimates of cost before they can be compared with other\
              \ direct CO2 mineralization technologies.\\n\\n### Possibilities for\
              \ downstream carbon mineralization\\n\\nOn its own, G. oxydans bioleachate\
              \ saturated with magnesium ions will be difficult to convert into stable\
              \ carbonate minerals. Due to the nature of acid leaching, the final\
              \ pH of biolixiviants post-leaching tended to be low (4\u20135) in our\
              \ experiments, making carbon mineralization chemically unfavorable.\
              \ Since pH has a significant influence on the precipitation of carbonates\
              \ due to the lower availability of carbonate ions in acidic conditions77,78,\
              \ pH adjustments are required to increase carbonate mineral yields downstream.\
              \ Increasing the concentration of gaseous CO2 injected or sparged through\
              \ the leachate increases the total dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC);\
              \ however, this reduces the pH of the leachate, reducing carbonate ion\
              \ availability and decreasing the saturation index of carbonate minerals2,77.\\\
              n\\nA possible downstream pathway to adjust the pH of leachates to make\
              \ carbon dioxide complexation chemically favorable is to add ammonia\
              \ from biological or natural sources to synthesize magnesite, MgCO3,\
              \ or nesquehonite, MgCO3\xB73H2O. Adding ammonia to CO2-sparged magnesium\
              \ chloride solutions at ambient temperatures was shown to completely\
              \ convert free magnesium ions into nesquehonite in about ten minutes79.\
              \ Furthermore, ammonia can be recycled in this process through recovery\
              \ of ammonia using activated carbon, which has been shown to recover\
              \ ammonium chloride salts and separate them into ammonia and hydrochloric\
              \ acid at near ambient conditions80. Another possibility is to simply\
              \ add sodium hydroxide that has been electrically synthesized from carbon-neutral\
              \ pathways.\\n\\nMicrobes that accelerate carbon mineralization, such\
              \ as cyanobacteria, have been observed to accelerate mineralization\
              \ in legacy alkaline mine tailings34,35. Coupling bio-accelerated weathering\
              \ from Gluconobacter oxydans with biotic downstream processes could\
              \ maximize carbonate precipitation in a low-resource and energy-efficient\
              \ process that could be genetically engineered further.\\n\\n### Scale-Up\
              \ and future steps\\n\\nIn order to show that bio-accelerated weathering\
              \ is a feasible option for gigatonne-scale CO2 sequestration, future\
              \ work will be required to show that a scaled-up bioprocess is possible\
              \ without a significant reduction in efficiency compared to the bench-scale\
              \ experiments shown here.\\n\\nBench-scale lab results rarely have equal\
              \ yields and efficiencies when scaled up to pilot- or industrial-scale\
              \ bioprocesses. Being an obligate aerobe, G. oxydans requires air exchange\
              \ and consistent mixing for optimal growth. Furthermore, optimized mixing\
              \ of the mineral substrate with biolixiviants, rate of glucose supplementation,\
              \ rate of mineral addition, and optimized particle sizes for leaching\
              \ are yet to be thoroughly investigated. To address these scale-up challenges,\
              \ all process parameters will need to be investigated in bioreactor\
              \ experiments.\\n\\nAnother consideration is how cell viability changes\
              \ throughout the leaching process. G. oxydans has been shown to be resilient\
              \ in high metal concentrations11, unlike several other microbes. However,\
              \ having high pulp densities of dunite would be a growth challenge for\
              \ G. oxydans. Despite this, cell viability during leaching may not be\
              \ a critical parameter for the effectiveness of leaching by G. oxydans\
              \ biolixiviants. For short term leaching, it is shown that having cells\
              \ present in the biolixiviant has an insignificant effect on leaching\
              \ (Fig. 4). Since biolixiviants are produced in an independent step\
              \ before leaching begins (Figure S1), it is not essential to have live\
              \ cells present during leaching. However, possible direct microbe-mineral\
              \ interactions and continued acid production may have an effect on long-term\
              \ leaching and scaled processes.\\n\\nOvercoming the deceleration of\
              \ leaching over time is also a future scale-up challenge to address.\
              \ The rates of leaching were shown to slow down over the 96 h they were\
              \ monitored (Fig. 3). As ultramafic minerals are dissolved by biolixiviants,\
              \ passivation layers can form from amorphous silica (Note S1) or other\
              \ mineral byproducts. Furthermore, as the solution nears saturation\
              \ of metal cations, dissolution rates are expected to stagnate. Future\
              \ investigations into overcoming the passivation layers and developing\
              \ integrated mineralization technologies to allow for continuous leaching\
              \ will be necessary for scale-up.\\n\\nUtilizing lignocellulosic-based\
              \ sugars as an alternative sugar feedstock also poses a challenge in\
              \ scale-up. Although G. oxydans has been shown to effectively produce\
              \ biolixiviants from cellulosic hydrolysate, the state of lignocellulosic\
              \ sugar production is underdeveloped. Large-scale production of sugars\
              \ derived from second-generation biomass (lignocellulose) is still limited,\
              \ and developments in improving efficiency and yield are ongoing. Advances\
              \ in the supply chain of lignocellulosic biomass and optimization in\
              \ pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis will be necessary in the near\
              \ future for the large-scale implementation of lignocellulosic-based\
              \ sugars for bio-accelerated weathering66.\\n\\n## G. oxydans biolixiviants\
              \ accelerate magnesium and energy-critical metal leaching by 20\xD7\
              \ over deionized water after 24 h\\n\\nBiolixiviants from wild-type\
              \ Gluconobacter oxydans effectively leached magnesium from ultramafic\
              \ rocks (Fig. 2A). The efficiency of extraction measures how much of\
              \ the available metal is leached from the mineral, and is calculated\

              \ for these experiments since it estimates the improvements made by\
              \ bio-accelerated leaching to leaching from environmental water sources,\
              \ such as rainwater. In traditional accelerated carbon mineralization\
              \ with ultramafic rocks, crushed rocks are dispersed over land, where\
              \ water from the environment is the solvent for magnesium8,29,30. Comparing\
              \ the concentrations of magnesium between leaching with biolixiviants\
              \ and water provides a rough estimate for the order of magnitude in\
              \ which carbon mineralization is accelerated by G. oxydans.\\n\\nAfter\
              \ 24 h of leaching with dunite at 1% pulp density, magnesium was leached\
              \ with an extraction efficiency of 11% (300 ppm), corresponding to an\
              \ increase of 20\xD7 when compared to the deionized water control (Fig.\
              \ 2A). The pH of wild-type biolixiviants was 2.39 \xB1 0.02 across all\
              \ experiments using wild-type biolixiviants. At the start of each leaching\
              \ experiment, the initial concentrations of all metals in biolixiviants\
              \ and controls are below detection limits. Figure S3 shows how the metal\
              \ concentrations in controls and G. oxydans leachates diverge within\
              \ the first few hours of leaching, starting with initial metal concentrations\
              \ of zero.Fig. 2Leaching dunite at 1% pulp density with wild-type (WT)G.\
              \ oxydans biolixiviant improves leaching of magnesium by 20-fold when\
              \ compared to leaching with deionized water (control). However, the\
              \ G. oxydans biolixiviant is only 6% better than just gluconic acid\
              \ at the same pH. Bioleaching of dunite at 1% pulp density shaking at\
              \ 22 \u02DAC for 24 h was performed with wild-type G. oxydans biolixiviant,\
              \ gluconic acid diluted to the same pH with deionized water, and a deionized\
              \ water control. Panels (A) to (E) show leaching concentrations and\
              \ extraction efficiencies of Mg, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni. Wild-type G. oxydans\
              \ biolixiviants slightly improved metal leaching compared to gluconic\
              \ acid across all metals. Stars denote significant difference between\
              \ gluconic acid leaching and wild-type biolixiviant leaching by a Welch\u2019\
              s two-sample t-test, where, p < 0.05 (*), p < 0.01 (**), p < 0.001 (***).\\\
              n\\n## Bioleaching of metals byG. oxydans increases by 73% from 24 to\
              \ 96 h\\n\\nThe most efficiently extracted metal at 24 h was Mn (Fig.\
              \ 2B), extracting over 15% of Mn from dunite (corresponding to a leachate\
              \ concentration of 1.6 ppm). Fe, Co, and Ni were also leached highly,\
              \ with efficiencies between 11% and 15% (Figs. 2C, D, and E, respectively).\
              \ Al and Cr were also leached, but much less efficiently (Figure S4).\
              \ Cr was the least efficiently extracted metal, with extraction of no\
              \ more than 0.3% under any condition (Figure S4 right column). We speculate\
              \ that chromium is significantly less leached since the chromite inclusions\
              \ within dunite are relatively more stable than olivine and resistant\
              \ to acid dissolution60.\\n\\nWhen leaching for longer than 24 h, bioleaching\
              \ efficiency continues to increase (Fig. 3). In a 96-hour bioleaching\
              \ analysis of dunite at 1% pulp density, bioleaching increased between\
              \ 24 and 96 h by an average of 73% for Mg, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni (Fig.\
              \ 3). After 96 h, the leaching of magnesium in biolixiviant is 42 times\
              \ that of water (Fig. 3). This shows that biolixiviants from G. oxydans\
              \ improve the overall leaching of metals at a rate faster than water.Fig.\
              \ 3Increasing leaching time to 96 h increases extraction efficiency\
              \ by an average of 73% between 24 and 96 h for Mg, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni.\
              \ Biolixiviants from wild-type G. oxydans leached dunite at 1% pulp\
              \ density for 96 h, shaking at 22 \xB0C. Mg, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni concentrations\
              \ were measured from leachates every 24 h for 96 h. Error bars indicate\
              \ standard deviation of measurements from duplicate measurements.\\\
              n\\n## TheG. oxydans biolixiviant is only 6% better than gluconic acid\
              \ at 1% pulp density\\n\\nA secondary control was performed using only\
              \ gluconic acid diluted with deionized water to the same pH as the acid\
              \ biolixiviants produced by G. oxydans. Reed et al.42 and Antonick et\
              \ al.49 demonstrated that biolixiviants produced by G. oxydans were\
              \ noticeably more effective at bioleaching than gluconic acid alone.\
              \ However, recent anecdotal evidence suggests this is not the case under\
              \ all conditions. In our hands, when bioleaching ultramafic materials\
              \ at low pulp density (1%), G. oxydans-produced biolixiviants only slightly\
              \ outperform gluconic acid in leaching most metals (Fig. 2). Wild-type\
              \ G. oxydans biolixiviants leached only 6% more magnesium compared to\
              \ pure gluconic acid that was diluted with ultrapure water to the same\
              \ pH after 24 h of leaching. Furthermore, at least with low pulp density\
              \ leaching, filtering cells from the biolixiviant did not significantly\
              \ affect bioleaching, at least under the conditions of these tests (Fig.\
              \ 4). This was done to assess if there was a significant residual effect\
              \ of microbial activity on leaching after biolixiviant production. Furthermore,\
              \ stoppering flasks during leaching to prevent gas exchange did not\
              \ significantly affect bioleaching (Figure S5). Later in the article,\
              \ we ask if there are conditions under which the G. oxydans biolixiviant\
              \ has a significant performance advantage for bioleaching ultramafic\
              \ materials.Fig. 4Filtering cells from theG. oxydans biolixiviant does\
              \ not notably reduce the bioleaching of metals from dunite after 24-hour\
              \ leaching. We compared Bioleaching of 1% dunite by sugar water (col.\
              \ 1), with whole cell lixiviant (col. 2), and with a biolixiviant that\
              \ was clarified by filtration with a 0.22 \u03BCm syringe filter (col.\
              \ 3). Filtered and unfiltered biolixiviants were at identical pH, produced\
              \ from duplicate colonies, and were added to ultramafic minerals in\
              \ identical conditions. Filtering biolixiviants before bioleaching resulted\
              \ in similar metal concentrations when compared to whole-cell biolixiviants\
              \ when leaching dunite. A Welch\u2019s two-sample t-test shows that\
              \ no significant difference was detected between the unfiltered and\
              \ filtered groups, with p-values ranging from 0.2 to 0.9. This indicates\
              \ that based on a 24-hour leaching study, the presence of G. oxydans\
              \ does not significantly improve or diminish the effect of the biolixiviant\
              \ on leaching in short term leaching.\\n\\n## Cellulosic hydrolysate\
              \ can be used as an alternative sugar feedstock for bioleaching\\n\\\
              nTechno-economic analysis shows that glucose feedstock for biolixiviant\
              \ production is the biggest cost driver in REE biomining with G. oxydans,\
              \ accounting for almost half of the total cost61. Furthermore, the sheer\
              \ scale that carbon sequestration needs to operate at, means that enormous\
              \ amounts of feedstock will be required, potentially placing a significant\
              \ demand on the world\u2019s biomass supply62.\\n\\nLignocellulose,\
              \ found in agricultural waste, can be a renewable carbon source for\
              \ microbial growth and production once monomeric sugars are released\
              \ through acid pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis, making a glucose-rich\
              \ cellulosic hydrolysate63,64. Lignocellulosic sugars are being increasingly\
              \ investigated as a potential alternative sugar source for several applications,\
              \ including biofuels/bioethanol production and substrates for cellular\
              \ production. Utilizing lignocellulose-derived sugars could serve as\
              \ a high glucose replacement feedstock that would greatly improve the\
              \ cost-efficiency of bioleaching for carbon capture technologies65,66.\
              \ G. oxydans has been shown to be able to convert the glucose and xylose\
              \ sugars in cellulosic hydrolysate into gluconic acid and xylonic acid\
              \ at extremely high efficiencies67\u201369. Replacing pure glucose with\
              \ cellulosic hydrolysate could further improve the economic and environmental\
              \ viability of bio-accelerated weathering.\\n\\nG. oxydans has been\
              \ shown to efficiently produce gluconic acid and xylonic acid from lignocellulosic\
              \ hydrolysate feedstocks67\u201369, making industrial-scale, bio-accelerated\
              \ carbon mineralization far more economically feasible. We investigated\
              \ if biolixiviants produced from cellulosic hydrolysate, rather than\
              \ pure glucose, could be effective at leaching dunite. The cellulosic\
              \ hydrolysate (CH) used in this study is a glucose-rich solution produced\
              \ from the enzymatic hydrolysis of concentrated corn stover (Table S3).\\\
              n\\nBiolixiviants produced from cellulosic hydrolysate were on average\
              \ 28% less effective in leaching magnesium compared to glucose-based\
              \ biolixiviants (Fig. 5). Leaching of Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni was also reduced\
              \ by an average of 52% compared to glucose-based biolixiviants (Fig.\
              \ 5). Dunite was added at 1% pulp density, and a leaching comparison\
              \ between CH-based and glucose-based lixiviants was conducted in parallel\
              \ and in identical conditions. The cellulosic hydrolysate added was\
              \ diluted with deionized water so that the total sugar concentrations\
              \ were equal to the amount of glucose added for glucose-based biolixiviants.Fig.\
              \ 5Use of cellulosic hydrolysate as a biolixiviant feedstock does not\
              \ considerably reduce bioleaching efficiency. Panels (A) to (E) show\
              \ comparison of bioleaching of Mg, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni by Gluconobacter\
              \ oxydans when using glucose and cellulosic hydrolysate (CH) as as biolixiviant\
              \ feedstock. CH-based biolixiviant leaches magnesium on average at 72%\
              \ the efficacy of glucose-based biolixiviant. Leaching was performed\
              \ with 1% dunite shaking at 22 \xB0C for 24 h. Stars denote significant\
              \ difference compared with glucose-based biolixiviants by a Welch\u2019\
              s two-sample t-test, where, p < 0.05 (*), p < 0.01 (**), p < 0.001 (***).\\\
              n\\nDespite a 28% average reduction in Mg leaching, we were unable to\
              \ detect a statistically meaningful difference between glucose- and\
              \ CH-based leaching of Mg using a Welch\u2019s two-sample t-test. This\
              \ was due to the small sample size and variability in CH-based biolixiviant\
              \ leachate measurements. Data collected for CH-based biolixiviants resulted\
              \ in greater variability than data with glucose-based biolixiviants.\
              \ ICP-MS analysis of cellulosic hydrolysate samples showed that the\
              \ CH used in this study contains trace concentrations of metals, possibly\
              \ as a result of the manufacturing process (Table S4). When calculating\
              \ the amounts of metal leached from CH-based biolixiviants, the concentrations\
              \ of metal in a cellulosic hydrolysate control study were subtracted\
              \ from the total detected to eliminate metal concentrations that were\
              \ not extracted from dunite. In low pulp density studies, the concentrations\
              \ of metals in the cellulosic hydrolysate feedstock interfered with\
              \ metals leached, resulting in higher overall error.\\n\\nCellulosic\
              \ hydrolysate produced from corn stover contains several toxins such\
              \ as organic acids, furan derivatives, and phenolic compounds that could\
              \ inhibit the growth of G. oxydans and its production of biolixiviant70.\
              \ Cellulosic hydrolysate also significantly increases viscosity, resulting\
              \ in lower oxygen transfer rates that limit the fermentation of glucose\
              \ to gluconic acid68. Despite this, leaching results show that G. oxydans\
              \ can produce a biolixiviant from cellulosic hydrolysate capable of\
              \ leaching metals at concentrations significantly greater than controls;\
              \ however, further analysis and experimentation are needed to show if\
              \ CH can be a viable replacement to glucose without a significant reduction\
              \ in performance.\\n\\nAlthough cellulosic hydrolysate contains mild\
              \ antibiotic properties due to its acidity and certain toxic compounds,\
              \ this could be advantageous for the industrial scale use of it as a\
              \ feedstock for biolixiviant production. G. oxydans has high acid resistance\
              \ and is capable of growing and producing biolixiviant with cellulosic\
              \ hydrolysate, while many other microbes have low tolerance mechanisms\
              \ for it. This could allow for cellulosic hydrolysate to be used as\
              \ an ultra-low-cost feedstock while also preventing the growth of competing\
              \ microbes. The toxic components of cellulosic hydrolysate could also\
              \ be a genetic engineering target for G. oxydans, where mutants that\
              \ have better resistance mechanisms can be selected for to improve biolixiviant\
              \ production.\\n\\n## G. oxydans mutant strain\u0394pstS, P112:mgdh\
              \ improved magnesium leaching by 12% over wild-type\\n\\nA preliminary\
              \ study using the mutant strain G. oxydans \u0394pstS, P112:mgdh43 shows\
              \ that under identical growth and leaching conditions, mutant strains\
              \ of G. oxydans can be more effective than wild-type in leaching magnesium\
              \ and energy-critical metals from dunite.\\n\\nA bioleaching analysis\
              \ over 96 h using dunite at 1% pulp density was conducted with biolixiviant\
              \ from wild-type and mutant G. oxydans. Bioleachate samples were taken\
              \ and analyzed every 24 h up to 96 h using ICP-MS. The strain used is\
              \ G. oxydans \u0394pstS, P112:mgdh, which was engineered to improve\
              \ acid production for metal leaching43. It contains a clean deletion\
              \ of the pstS gene which is involved in phosphate signaling and transport44,\
              \ and an up-regulation with promoter P112 of the mgdh gene (Membrane-bound\
              \ Glucose DeHydrogenase) which is critical for converting glucose into\
              \ gluconic acid71. The \u0394pstS, P112:mgdh mutant was previously shown\
              \ to decrease the pH of biolixiviants compared to wild-type, and it\
              \ increases the overall leaching of REE43. The biolixiviant produced\
              \ from the \u0394pstS, P112:mgdh mutant had a pH of 2.01 \xB1 0.02 across\
              \ all replicates, while the pH of wild-type biolixiviants were 2.39\
              \ \xB1 0.02.\\n\\nThe analysis shows that \u0394pstS, P112:mgdh mutant\
              \ biolixiviant increases magnesium leaching by an average of 12% over\
              \ all samples taken between 24 and 96 h of leaching. Mn, Fe, Co, and\
              \ Ni had an average improvement in leaching of 12% using mutant biolixiviant\
              \ compared to wild-type (Fig. 6).Fig. 6Bioleaching efficiency of magnesium\
              \ increased by an average of 12% when leaching with a high performingG.\

              \ of G. oxydans is yet to be completely characterized, and several other\
              \ genes may exist that are critical in controlling metal leaching from\
              \ ultramafic rocks. Future work to characterize the genome of G. oxydans\
              \ in terms of its functions related to ultramafic leaching is vital\
              \ to engineer better mutant strains that can improve the performance\

              \ engineered to maximize gluconic acid production; however, studies\
              \ have shown that for rare earths leaching, G. oxydans mutants can be\
              \ screened to identify genes that specifically affect rare earth extraction50.\

              \ At higher dunite pulp densities, the improvement of Gluconobacter\

              \ is the price per unit mass of the feedstock.\\n\\nIn this work, we\
              \ succeeded in reducing kseq from 525 to 1.0 (almost 3 orders of magnitude)\
              \ (Fig. 8). With 1% dunite and 24 h of leaching, the approximate kseq\
              \ is 525 carbon invested/magnesium leached. One method to reduce kseq\
              \ is to increase the time of leaching. After 96 h of leaching, the magnesium\
              \ concentration increased by 81% when compared to 24 h leaching at the\
              \ same pulp density (Fig. 3). When increasing the time of leaching to\
              \ 10 days, the magnesium concentration improved by an average of 147%\
              \ (Fig. 8). Increasing the pulp density of dunite also reduces kseq.\
              \ When compared to 1% pulp density of dunite, increasing to 10% pulp\
              \ density resulted in a 5-fold increase in magnesium leaching after\
              \ 24 h (Fig. 8). When combining 10% pulp density with 10 days of leaching,\
              \ magnesium leaching increased by 9.2 times that of 1% pulp density\
              \ leached for 1 day (Fig. 8), resulting in a kseq of 57, since glucose\
              \ input remained unchanged. For the lowest kseq values achieved, fine-particle\
              \ dunite at a pulp density of 60% was leached for 19 days with three\
              \ different methods (Fig. 8 Leaching Attempts #12\u201314). The first\
              \ method (Fig. 8 Leaching Attempt #12) was direct addition of 60% dunite,\
              \ the second method (Leaching Attempt #13) was a 2-step dunite addition,\
              \ where 30% dunite was added on day 0 and another 30% added on day 10,\
              \ and the third method (Leaching Attempt #14) was a 2-step dunite addition\
              \ where the first 30% dunite feed was removed from the leachate before\
              \ the second 30% addition on day 10. All three leaching methods resulted\
              \ in a kseq equal to or less than 1.0, with the lowest kseq being 0.96\
              \ on Leaching Attempt #13 in Fig. 8.Fig. 8Process and genetic improvements\
              \ reduce the amount of feedstock carbon needed to potentially sequester\
              \ one CO2 molecule from 525 to 1. Increasing leaching time, pulp density,\
              \ and reducing average particle sizes were able to reduce kseq (glucose\
              \ carbon investment vs. carbon sequestration ratio) by several orders\
              \ of magnitude. Increasing dunite pulp density from 1\u201310% had a\
              \ larger impact in reducing kseq than increasing leaching time from\
              \ 1 to 10 days. Combining the \u0394pstS, P112:mdgh double mutant with\
              \ high pulp densities and long leaching times resulted in a kseq value\
              \ of 1 in three experiments (Col. 10\u201312). Leaching attempts #1\u2013\
              9 used DUN-1 and attempts #10\u201312 used DUN-3 with a particle size\
              \ of less than 74 microns as the leaching substrate.\\n\\nWhat implications\
              \ do these results have for CO2 sequestration? For kseq = 525, when\
              \ using glucose as a feedstock, the cost of sequestering 1 tonne of\
              \ CO2 is $358,000, a long way above the US Department of Energy\u2019\
              s (DOE) target of $100 per tonne72, and well above existing technologies31.\
              \ On the other hand, if we could reduce kseq to 1 (as in Fig. 8) at\
              \ industrial scale, the cost of carbon sequestration (at least the microbial\
              \ feedstock part of the cost) through bio-accelerated weathering starts\
              \ to become comparable to (still high) current technologies, at $682\
              \ per tonne31. If we could reduce kseq to 0.15 (about a 6-fold reduction\
              \ over our best attempt, much smaller than the reduction we achieved\
              \ in the course of writing this article) then we could reduce the feedstock\
              \ cost for sequestering 1 tonne of CO2 to $100. This would not account\
              \ for the costs of mining ultramafic material, but nor does it account\
              \ for the offset cost of energy-critical metal recovery. However, using\
              \ this to sequester 20 gigatonnes of CO2 a year5 would require 2 billion\
              \ tonnes of glucose, over 10 times current global annual sugar production73.\\\
              n\\nSugars derived from cellulosic biomass are potentially much more\
              \ abundant than glucose that is derived from cereal crops like corn,\
              \ sugar cane, and sugar beet74. While there is no widespread production\
              \ of cellulosic sugars today that is not immediately diverted to cellulosic\
              \ ethanol production, this could happen in the future. Furthermore,\
              \ it is estimated that cellulosic sugar production could be as low as\
              \ $100 per tonne75 (in contrast to around $1,000 per tonne for glucose).\
              \ Although cellulosic sugars are abundant, they are not limitless. Slade\
              \ et al.76, made estimates of global bioenergy supply, and concluded\
              \ that several tipping points would occur as the amount of biomass withdrawn\
              \ from the biosphere for bioenergy (or some other chemical production,\
              \ such as carbon sequestration) increased, forcing increasingly unpalatable\
              \ choices on global society including mass adoption of vegetarian diets,\
              \ mass deforestation, population control, or combinations thereof. Their\
              \ analysis suggests that the first global agricultural tipping point\
              \ (choosing one of the three unpalatable options) would occur when biomass\
              \ was withdrawn at a rate of around 7 gigatonnes per year62. Assuming\
              \ that cellulosic sugars are on average a 50:50 mix of C5 and C6 sugars,\
              \ then to reduce the cellulosic biomass demand to sequester 20 gigatonnes\
              \ of CO2 to 3.5 gigatonnes, kseq needs only to be reduced to 0.25.\\\
              n\\nAlthough kseq serves as a useful metric for displaying sugar investment\
              \ in terms of CO2 sequestration potential, it is only a theoretical\
              \ value whose real value will depend on the conversion rates of downstream\
              \ CO2 mineralization. Since glucose inputs are a major cost driver in\
              \ bio-accelerated weathering61, kseq can help estimate lower-limit costs\
              \ of scaled operations. Future scale-up work will be necessary to formulate\
              \ more accurate estimates of cost before they can be compared with other\
              \ direct CO2 mineralization technologies.\\n\\n## Possibilities for\
              \ downstream carbon mineralization\\n\\nOn its own, G. oxydans bioleachate\
              \ saturated with magnesium ions will be difficult to convert into stable\
              \ carbonate minerals. Due to the nature of acid leaching, the final\
              \ pH of biolixiviants post-leaching tended to be low (4\u20135) in our\
              \ experiments, making carbon mineralization chemically unfavorable.\
              \ Since pH has a significant influence on the precipitation of carbonates\
              \ due to the lower availability of carbonate ions in acidic conditions77,78,\
              \ pH adjustments are required to increase carbonate mineral yields downstream.\
              \ Increasing the concentration of gaseous CO2 injected or sparged through\
              \ the leachate increases the total dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC);\
              \ however, this reduces the pH of the leachate, reducing carbonate ion\
              \ availability and decreasing the saturation index of carbonate minerals2,77.\\\
              n\\nA possible downstream pathway to adjust the pH of leachates to make\
              \ carbon dioxide complexation chemically favorable is to add ammonia\
              \ from biological or natural sources to synthesize magnesite, MgCO3,\
              \ or nesquehonite, MgCO3\xB73H2O. Adding ammonia to CO2-sparged magnesium\
              \ chloride solutions at ambient temperatures was shown to completely\
              \ convert free magnesium ions into nesquehonite in about ten minutes79.\
              \ Furthermore, ammonia can be recycled in this process through recovery\
              \ of ammonia using activated carbon, which has been shown to recover\
              \ ammonium chloride salts and separate them into ammonia and hydrochloric\
              \ acid at near ambient conditions80. Another possibility is to simply\
              \ add sodium hydroxide that has been electrically synthesized from carbon-neutral\
              \ pathways.\\n\\nMicrobes that accelerate carbon mineralization, such\
              \ as cyanobacteria, have been observed to accelerate mineralization\
              \ in legacy alkaline mine tailings34,35. Coupling bio-accelerated weathering\
              \ from Gluconobacter oxydans with biotic downstream processes could\
              \ maximize carbonate precipitation in a low-resource and energy-efficient\
              \ process that could be genetically engineered further.\\n\\n## Scale-Up\
              \ and future steps\\n\\nIn order to show that bio-accelerated weathering\
              \ is a feasible option for gigatonne-scale CO2 sequestration, future\
              \ work will be required to show that a scaled-up bioprocess is possible\
              \ without a significant reduction in efficiency compared to the bench-scale\
              \ experiments shown here.\\n\\nBench-scale lab results rarely have equal\
              \ yields and efficiencies when scaled up to pilot- or industrial-scale\
              \ bioprocesses. Being an obligate aerobe, G. oxydans requires air exchange\
              \ and consistent mixing for optimal growth. Furthermore, optimized mixing\
              \ of the mineral substrate with biolixiviants, rate of glucose supplementation,\
              \ rate of mineral addition, and optimized particle sizes for leaching\
              \ are yet to be thoroughly investigated. To address these scale-up challenges,\
              \ all process parameters will need to be investigated in bioreactor\
              \ experiments.\\n\\nAnother consideration is how cell viability changes\
              \ throughout the leaching process. G. oxydans has been shown to be resilient\
              \ in high metal concentrations11, unlike several other microbes. However,\
              \ having high pulp densities of dunite would be a growth challenge for\
              \ G. oxydans. Despite this, cell viability during leaching may not be\
              \ a critical parameter for the effectiveness of leaching by G. oxydans\
              \ biolixiviants. For short term leaching, it is shown that having cells\
              \ present in the biolixiviant has an insignificant effect on leaching\
              \ (Fig. 4). Since biolixiviants are produced in an independent step\
              \ before leaching begins (Figure S1), it is not essential to have live\
              \ cells present during leaching. However, possible direct microbe-mineral\
              \ interactions and continued acid production may have an effect on long-term\
              \ leaching and scaled processes.\\n\\nOvercoming the deceleration of\
              \ leaching over time is also a future scale-up challenge to address.\
              \ The rates of leaching were shown to slow down over the 96 h they were\
              \ monitored (Fig. 3). As ultramafic minerals are dissolved by biolixiviants,\
              \ passivation layers can form from amorphous silica (Note S1) or other\
              \ mineral byproducts. Furthermore, as the solution nears saturation\
              \ of metal cations, dissolution rates are expected to stagnate. Future\
              \ investigations into overcoming the passivation layers and developing\
              \ integrated mineralization technologies to allow for continuous leaching\
              \ will be necessary for scale-up.\\n\\nUtilizing lignocellulosic-based\
              \ sugars as an alternative sugar feedstock also poses a challenge in\
              \ scale-up. Although G. oxydans has been shown to effectively produce\
              \ biolixiviants from cellulosic hydrolysate, the state of lignocellulosic\
              \ sugar production is underdeveloped. Large-scale production of sugars\
              \ derived from second-generation biomass (lignocellulose) is still limited,\
              \ and developments in improving efficiency and yield are ongoing. Advances\
              \ in the supply chain of lignocellulosic biomass and optimization in\
              \ pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis will be necessary in the near\
              \ future for the large-scale implementation of lignocellulosic-based\
              \ sugars for bio-accelerated weathering66.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nThis\
              \ article shows that G. oxydans possesses the capability to bioleach\
              \ metals for energy technologies and carbon mineralization from dunite.\
              \ At low pulp densities (1%), the G. oxydans organic acid-based biolixiviant\
              \ is 20\xD7 more effective at Mg leaching than deionized water. At high\
              \ pulp densities (60%), the biolixiviant is 3.2\xD7 better than even\
              \ gluconic acid alone. This suggests that microbially-accelerated weathering\
              \ of ultramafic materials could be an environmentally-friendly method\
              \ for supplying Mg for mineralization of CO2, and metals like Ni and\
              \ Co for sustainable energy technologies at rates that can far exceed\
              \ equivalent abiotic methods.\\n\\nSeveral pH swing methods have been\
              \ shown to be highly effective for greatly accelerating olivine carbonation7,81.\
              \ However, scaling up these technologies to meet the world\u2019s CO2\
              \ removal requirements may involve high energy costs82 and environmental\
              \ drawbacks like those found in strong acid leaching involved with large\
              \ scale energy-critical metal mining. Other methods of accelerated weathering\
              \ involving energy-intensive preprocessing of mineral feedstocks by\
              \ crushing, grinding, and chemically treating ultramafic rocks also\
              \ come with their own environmental and scaling drawbacks. In situ accelerated\
              \ ultramafic weathering can result in environmental leaching and environmental\
              \ drainage of harmful doses of nickel, chromium, and cobalt59,83\u2013\
              85. These methods also involve slow kinetics that depend on high energy\
              \ inputs to be accelerated and enormous land use7,28,82,86.\\n\\nBio-accelerated\
              \ weathering may be an alternative approach to mineral weathering for\
              \ carbon mineralization. When engineered further, this strategy may\
              \ prove an economically-viable and scalable option that avoids the environmental\
              \ concerns with in situ mechanically-accelerated weathering and strong\
              \ acid leaching51,59,84,85,87, as well as the energy costs involved\
              \ in high temperature and pressure reactions14,82. Energy requirements\
              \ for heating in common abiotic carbonation processes, such as ammonium\
              \ salts-driven pH swings and HCl pH swings, often result in CO2 emissions\
              \ greater than the amount sequestered82. G. oxydans-based bioleaching\
              \ was shown to be effective at ambient temperature and pressure, removing\
              \ a major energy burden for this process.\\n\\nIn this article, we were\
              \ able to reduce the number of carbon atoms in glucose needed to sequester\
              \ one molecule of CO2 from 525 to 1. However, further work needs to\
              \ be done to optimize G. oxydans for enhanced weathering for carbon\
              \ mineralization. Maximizing the leaching of magnesium while minimizing\
              \ carbon inputs and lowering the economic costs are key steps to making\
              \ this technology viable for eliminating the several gigatonnes of carbon\
              \ dioxide in excess on our planet.\\n\\n## Materials and methods\\n\\\
              nUltramafic samples were collected from the Day Brook Dunite (35\u02DA\
              \ 58\u2019 0.45\u201D N, 82\u02DA 16\u2019 58.60\u201D W) in western\
              \ North Carolina88. The chemically weathered exterior of the dunite\
              \ was removed using a tile saw (151991, MK Diamond Products, Inc., Torrance,\
              \ CA). The trimmed interior was crushed into powder using a SPEX SamplePrep\
              \ 8000M mill and a tungsten carbide vial. Before bioleaching experiments,\
              \ the mineralogy of powder from two samples was analyzed via x-ray diffraction\
              \ (XRD) with a Bruker D8 Advance ECO powder diffractometer at Cornell\
              \ Center for Materials Research (CCMR). The instrument is equipped with\
              \ a Copper K-\u03B1 X-ray source. Analyses were made at 5 to 60 degrees,\
              \ with an increment of 0.019 degrees and a dwell time of 0.3 seconds\
              \ per step. To mitigate Fe fluorescence the detector\u2019s lower discriminator\
              \ was raised from 0.110 V to 0.182 V. XRD shows that sample DUN-1 consists\
              \ of 64 wt. % olivine, 27 wt. % lizardite, 5 wt. % antigorite, and 4\
              \ wt. % talc. Sample DUN-2 contains 37 wt. % olivine, 59 wt. % lizardite,\
              \ 2 wt. % talc, and 2 wt. % meixnerite. Sample DUN-3 contains 92 wt.\
              \ % olivine, 5 wt. % antigorite, 2 wt. % lizardite, and 1 wt. % talc.\
              \ Major and trace element compositions of the bulk rock were determined\
              \ at the Hamilton Analytical Laboratory in Clinton, NY via XRF and LA-ICPMS\
              \ and are shown in Tables S1 and S2.\\n\\nThree separate dunite samples\
              \ were used in bioleaching studies. DUN-1 was used in the leaching studies\
              \ shown in Figures 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and Supplementary Figures S4 and S5.\
              \ Due to the depletion of DUN-1 in previous experiments, DUN-2 was used\
              \ to produce the data used in Figure 7. DUN-3 was used in Leaching Attempts\

              \ significance in comparative bioleaching studies. A Welch\u2019s two-sample\
              \ t-test was done since some studies, such as a comparison of sugar\
              \ feedstocks (Fig. 5), resulted in differences in variances between\
              \ the two groups tested. The Welch\u2019s t-test is more appropriate\
              \ in instances when the variances between two groups cannot be considered\
              \ as equal. Significance was displayed in all figures as dots and stars,\
              \ where p < 0.1 (.), p < 0.05 (*), p < 0.01 (**), p < 0.001 (***).\\\

              \ tonnes of anthropogenic CO2 in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere1\u2013\
              4 driving global climate change is one of the most pressing challenges\
              \ of our time. To address this, the IPCC\u2019s Special Report in 2018\
              \ stresses the necessity of deploying carbon dioxide removal (CDR) technology\
              \ capable of removing tens of gigatonnes of CO2 from the atmosphere\
              \ annually, paired with carbon-neutral energy technologies to prevent\
              \ global warming from exceeding 1.5\u02DAC above pre-industrial levels5.Mineralization\
              \ of CO2 is a highly attractive approach for permanent sequestration\
              \ of CO2, as it converts atmospheric carbon into solid minerals as a\
              \ permanent sink6,7. Carbon mineralization proceeds through a two-step\
              \ process. First, ultramafic rocks are dissolved by weathering to release\
              \ magnesium cations (Note S1). In the second step, magnesium ions are\
              \ reacted with dissolved carbonate to form magnesite (MgCO3), a stable\
              \ mineral that permanently stores CO28 (Note S1). A schematic of a proposed\
              \ indirect carbonation method is shown in Fig. 1.Fig. 1Proposed system\
              \ for bio-accelerated weathering of ultramafic materials for carbon\
              \ mineralization. This work focuses on the rate-limiting step, the metal\
              \ leaching stage (enclosed in red box), where G. oxydans biolixiviant\
              \ leaches magnesium ions and other metals from dunite. Downstream carbonation\
              \ results in magnesite formation for CO2 storage, and metal recovery\
              \ done chemically or electrochemically can extract energy-critical metals\
              \ for commercial use.Naturally occurring weathering of ultramafic rocks\
              \ and subsequent carbon mineralization is thought to be responsible\
              \ for removal of up to hundreds of millions of tonnes of CO2 each year8\u2013\
              11. In fact, because ultramafic rocks are so abundant12,13, reaction\
              \ of all of the metal cations in all surface-accessible ultramafic material\
              \ could capture 100 trillion tonnes of CO2 as carbonate minerals14 (at\
              \ least 58\xD7 the excess CO2 in the atmosphere), making them a strong\
              \ candidate for gigatonne-scale CDR15,8,16. However, natural carbon\
              \ mineralization is partially offset by oxidation of rock organic carbon11,17.\
              \ As a result, the time to naturally regulate atmospheric CO2 levels\
              \ is estimated to be between tens and hundreds of thousands of years8,11,18\u2013\
              20.The large-scale deployment of carbon-neutral energy technologies\
              \ will also be necessary to control climate change5, but it will require\
              \ vast quantities of metals21. In addition to metal cations needed for\
              \ CO2 sequestration, ultramafic minerals are a potential low-grade ore\
              \ source for energy-critical metals such as nickel (batteries and stainless\
              \ steel), chromium (concentrated solar and geothermal energy), manganese\
              \ (steel and batteries), cobalt (batteries), and copper (wiring and\
              \ wind turbines)8,21\u201325 (Figure S2, Tables S1 and S2). This presents\
              \ an opportunity to extract energy-critical metals from ultramafic rock\
              \ while sequestering CO2.However, extracting metals from ultramafic\
              \ rocks poses a significant challenge. In aqueous mineral carbonation,\
              \ the rate of carbon mineralization is limited by the slow kinetics\
              \ of the leaching of metal ions from ultramafic sources14,26,27. While\
              \ mechanical acceleration of ultramafic weathering through crushing,\
              \ grinding, heating, chemically treating, and spreading over land is\
              \ promising for its high sequestration potential and improved kinetics8,16,28\u2013\
              30, it requires large area footprints and high energy inputs involved\
              \ in crushing, grinding, heating, and pressurizing, making it prohibitively\
              \ expensive31. Likewise, technologies to extract the energy-critical\
              \ elements present in low concentration in ultramafic rocks present\
              \ formidable economic and environmental challenges24,32,33.We hypothesize\
              \ that microbially-accelerated mineral dissolution could overcome the\
              \ slow kinetics and high costs14 of the dissolution of ultramafic material,\
              \ releasing magnesium ions at a rate several orders of magnitude greater\
              \ than in nature34,35. Over the past two decades, microbial mineral\
              \ dissolution has revolutionized mining copper and gold from low-grade\
              \ ores\u2014a process known as biomining. Bacteria such as Acidithiobacillus\
              \ ferrooxidans and related species are responsible for producing about\
              \ 15% of the world\u2019s copper supply and about 5% of its gold supply36\
              \ through iron-redox-mediated bioleaching, a process in which microbes\
              \ alter the redox state of metals to extract them from mineral substrates37,38.\
              \ Significant research has been performed to improve industrial-scale\
              \ Cu bioleaching with consortia including A. ferrooxidans and non-domesticated\
              \ microbes, resulting in processes that are fairly mature. While copper\
              \ biomining is the only industrialized biomining process, organisms\
              \ and processes are in development for rare earth elements (REE)39\u2013\
              44 and lithium45,46.Biolixiviants produced by Gluconobacter oxydans\
              \ are a strong candidate for a sustainable and strong catalyst for CO2\
              \ mineralization using ultramafic rocks11,47. A recent study from our\
              \ team comparing the dunite dissolution performance of three mineral-dissolving\
              \ microbes, Gluconobacter oxydans, Sphingomonas desiccabilis, and Penicillium\
              \ simplicissimum, concludes that G. oxydans outperformed the other two\
              \ in the extraction of all metals from dunite11.G. oxydans efficiently\
              \ produces a gluconic acid-based mineral-dissolving solution, called\
              \ a biolixiviant, when glucose is present47,48. Previous studies have\
              \ shown that biolixiviants from G. oxydans can be more effective than\
              \ just gluconic acid at leaching REE42,49. In a recent article, our\
              \ team identified genes that control the effectiveness of the G. oxydans\
              \ biolixiviant at dissolving neodymium phosphate (synthetic monazite)\
              \ but do not notably change its pH50. These results suggest that biologically-produced\
              \ lixiviants could contain additional components, such as metal chelators,\
              \ redox molecules, and flavins that improve overall metal leaching at\
              \ fixed pH, allowing for more efficient and low-resource metal leaching.\
              \ This could avoid the use of strong acids that can have harmful environmental\
              \ effects such as acid mine drainage51.Second, it is suspected that\
              \ microbes interact with ultramafic materials in the wild, accelerating\
              \ weathering processes52\u201355. Furthermore, laboratory mixed cultures\
              \ have been shown to dissolve ultramafic material56. Meanwhile, in two\
              \ companion articles, we demonstrate that three easily culturable isolated\
              \ species (G. oxydans, Penicillium simplicissimum and Sphingomonas desiccabilis)\
              \ can all accelerate the dissolution of ultramafic material11 and characterize\
              \ mineral phase transformations due to bioleaching by G. oxydans57.However,\
              \ there has been little systematic study of microbial dissolution of\
              \ ultramafic minerals. Furthermore, it remains unclear under what conditions\
              \ a biolixiviant could be more effective than just an organic acid and\
              \ why; could genetic engineering improve ultramafic bioleaching; what\
              \ impact process parameters have on biological dissolution of ultramafic\
              \ materials; the extraction efficiencies for energy critical elements;\
              \ utilization of low-cost feedstock; and the carbon source demand of\
              \ large-scale ultramafic bioleaching. To address these knowledge gaps,\
              \ we provide some of the first systematic observations of dissolution\
              \ of ultramafic minerals by the mineral-dissolving microbe, G. oxydans\
              \ B58.\",\"results\":\"Results and discussionIn this work, we perform\

              \ these experiments since it estimates the improvements made by bio-accelerated\
              \ leaching to leaching from environmental water sources, such as rainwater.\
              \ In traditional accelerated carbon mineralization with ultramafic rocks,\
              \ crushed rocks are dispersed over land, where water from the environment\
              \ is the solvent for magnesium8,29,30. Comparing the concentrations\
              \ of magnesium between leaching with biolixiviants and water provides\
              \ a rough estimate for the order of magnitude in which carbon mineralization\
              \ is accelerated by G. oxydans.After 24 h of leaching with dunite at\
              \ 1% pulp density, magnesium was leached with an extraction efficiency\
              \ of 11% (300 ppm), corresponding to an increase of 20\xD7 when compared\
              \ to the deionized water control (Fig. 2A). The pH of wild-type biolixiviants\
              \ was 2.39 \xB1 0.02 across all experiments using wild-type biolixiviants.\
              \ At the start of each leaching experiment, the initial concentrations\
              \ of all metals in biolixiviants and controls are below detection limits.\
              \ Figure S3 shows how the metal concentrations in controls and G. oxydans\
              \ leachates diverge within the first few hours of leaching, starting\
              \ with initial metal concentrations of zero.Fig. 2Leaching dunite at\
              \ 1% pulp density with wild-type (WT)G. oxydans biolixiviant improves\
              \ leaching of magnesium by 20-fold when compared to leaching with deionized\
              \ water (control). However, the G. oxydans biolixiviant is only 6% better\
              \ than just gluconic acid at the same pH. Bioleaching of dunite at 1%\
              \ pulp density shaking at 22 \u02DAC for 24 h was performed with wild-type\
              \ G. oxydans biolixiviant, gluconic acid diluted to the same pH with\
              \ deionized water, and a deionized water control. Panels (A) to (E)\
              \ show leaching concentrations and extraction efficiencies of Mg, Mn,\
              \ Fe, Co, and Ni. Wild-type G. oxydans biolixiviants slightly improved\
              \ metal leaching compared to gluconic acid across all metals. Stars\
              \ denote significant difference between gluconic acid leaching and wild-type\
              \ biolixiviant leaching by a Welch\u2019s two-sample t-test, where,\
              \ p < 0.05 (*), p < 0.01 (**), p < 0.001 (***).Bioleaching of metals\
              \ byG. oxydans increases by 73% from 24 to 96 hThe most efficiently\
              \ extracted metal at 24 h was Mn (Fig. 2B), extracting over 15% of Mn\
              \ from dunite (corresponding to a leachate concentration of 1.6 ppm).\
              \ Fe, Co, and Ni were also leached highly, with efficiencies between\
              \ 11% and 15% (Figs. 2C, D, and E, respectively). Al and Cr were also\
              \ leached, but much less efficiently (Figure S4). Cr was the least efficiently\
              \ extracted metal, with extraction of no more than 0.3% under any condition\
              \ (Figure S4 right column). We speculate that chromium is significantly\
              \ less leached since the chromite inclusions within dunite are relatively\
              \ more stable than olivine and resistant to acid dissolution60.When\
              \ leaching for longer than 24 h, bioleaching efficiency continues to\
              \ increase (Fig. 3). In a 96-hour bioleaching analysis of dunite at\
              \ 1% pulp density, bioleaching increased between 24 and 96 h by an average\
              \ of 73% for Mg, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni (Fig. 3). After 96 h, the leaching\
              \ of magnesium in biolixiviant is 42 times that of water (Fig. 3). This\
              \ shows that biolixiviants from G. oxydans improve the overall leaching\
              \ of metals at a rate faster than water.Fig. 3Increasing leaching time\
              \ to 96 h increases extraction efficiency by an average of 73% between\
              \ 24 and 96 h for Mg, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni. Biolixiviants from wild-type\
              \ G. oxydans leached dunite at 1% pulp density for 96 h, shaking at\
              \ 22 \xB0C. Mg, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni concentrations were measured from\
              \ leachates every 24 h for 96 h. Error bars indicate standard deviation\
              \ of measurements from duplicate measurements.TheG. oxydans biolixiviant\
              \ is only 6% better than gluconic acid at 1% pulp densityA secondary\
              \ control was performed using only gluconic acid diluted with deionized\
              \ water to the same pH as the acid biolixiviants produced by G. oxydans.\
              \ Reed et al.42 and Antonick et al.49 demonstrated that biolixiviants\
              \ produced by G. oxydans were noticeably more effective at bioleaching\
              \ than gluconic acid alone. However, recent anecdotal evidence suggests\
              \ this is not the case under all conditions. In our hands, when bioleaching\
              \ ultramafic materials at low pulp density (1%), G. oxydans-produced\
              \ biolixiviants only slightly outperform gluconic acid in leaching most\
              \ metals (Fig. 2). Wild-type G. oxydans biolixiviants leached only 6%\
              \ more magnesium compared to pure gluconic acid that was diluted with\
              \ ultrapure water to the same pH after 24 h of leaching. Furthermore,\
              \ at least with low pulp density leaching, filtering cells from the\
              \ biolixiviant did not significantly affect bioleaching, at least under\
              \ the conditions of these tests (Fig. 4). This was done to assess if\
              \ there was a significant residual effect of microbial activity on leaching\
              \ after biolixiviant production. Furthermore, stoppering flasks during\
              \ leaching to prevent gas exchange did not significantly affect bioleaching\
              \ (Figure S5). Later in the article, we ask if there are conditions\
              \ under which the G. oxydans biolixiviant has a significant performance\
              \ advantage for bioleaching ultramafic materials.Fig. 4Filtering cells\
              \ from theG. oxydans biolixiviant does not notably reduce the bioleaching\
              \ of metals from dunite after 24-hour leaching. We compared Bioleaching\
              \ of 1% dunite by sugar water (col. 1), with whole cell lixiviant (col.\
              \ 2), and with a biolixiviant that was clarified by filtration with\
              \ a 0.22 \u03BCm syringe filter (col. 3). Filtered and unfiltered biolixiviants\
              \ were at identical pH, produced from duplicate colonies, and were added\
              \ to ultramafic minerals in identical conditions. Filtering biolixiviants\
              \ before bioleaching resulted in similar metal concentrations when compared\
              \ to whole-cell biolixiviants when leaching dunite. A Welch\u2019s two-sample\
              \ t-test shows that no significant difference was detected between the\
              \ unfiltered and filtered groups, with p-values ranging from 0.2 to\
              \ 0.9. This indicates that based on a 24-hour leaching study, the presence\
              \ of G. oxydans does not significantly improve or diminish the effect\
              \ of the biolixiviant on leaching in short term leaching.Cellulosic\
              \ hydrolysate can be used as an alternative sugar feedstock for bioleachingTechno-economic\
              \ analysis shows that glucose feedstock for biolixiviant production\
              \ is the biggest cost driver in REE biomining with G. oxydans, accounting\
              \ for almost half of the total cost61. Furthermore, the sheer scale\
              \ that carbon sequestration needs to operate at, means that enormous\
              \ amounts of feedstock will be required, potentially placing a significant\
              \ demand on the world\u2019s biomass supply62.Lignocellulose, found\
              \ in agricultural waste, can be a renewable carbon source for microbial\
              \ growth and production once monomeric sugars are released through acid\
              \ pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis, making a glucose-rich cellulosic\
              \ hydrolysate63,64. Lignocellulosic sugars are being increasingly investigated\
              \ as a potential alternative sugar source for several applications,\
              \ including biofuels/bioethanol production and substrates for cellular\
              \ production. Utilizing lignocellulose-derived sugars could serve as\
              \ a high glucose replacement feedstock that would greatly improve the\
              \ cost-efficiency of bioleaching for carbon capture technologies65,66.\
              \ G. oxydans has been shown to be able to convert the glucose and xylose\
              \ sugars in cellulosic hydrolysate into gluconic acid and xylonic acid\
              \ at extremely high efficiencies67\u201369. Replacing pure glucose with\
              \ cellulosic hydrolysate could further improve the economic and environmental\
              \ viability of bio-accelerated weathering.G. oxydans has been shown\
              \ to efficiently produce gluconic acid and xylonic acid from lignocellulosic\
              \ hydrolysate feedstocks67\u201369, making industrial-scale, bio-accelerated\
              \ carbon mineralization far more economically feasible. We investigated\
              \ if biolixiviants produced from cellulosic hydrolysate, rather than\
              \ pure glucose, could be effective at leaching dunite. The cellulosic\
              \ hydrolysate (CH) used in this study is a glucose-rich solution produced\
              \ from the enzymatic hydrolysis of concentrated corn stover (Table S3).Biolixiviants\
              \ produced from cellulosic hydrolysate were on average 28% less effective\
              \ in leaching magnesium compared to glucose-based biolixiviants (Fig.\
              \ 5). Leaching of Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni was also reduced by an average\
              \ of 52% compared to glucose-based biolixiviants (Fig. 5). Dunite was\
              \ added at 1% pulp density, and a leaching comparison between CH-based\
              \ and glucose-based lixiviants was conducted in parallel and in identical\
              \ conditions. The cellulosic hydrolysate added was diluted with deionized\
              \ water so that the total sugar concentrations were equal to the amount\
              \ of glucose added for glucose-based biolixiviants.Fig. 5Use of cellulosic\
              \ hydrolysate as a biolixiviant feedstock does not considerably reduce\
              \ bioleaching efficiency. Panels (A) to (E) show comparison of bioleaching\
              \ of Mg, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni by Gluconobacter oxydans when using glucose\
              \ and cellulosic hydrolysate (CH) as as biolixiviant feedstock. CH-based\
              \ biolixiviant leaches magnesium on average at 72% the efficacy of glucose-based\
              \ biolixiviant. Leaching was performed with 1% dunite shaking at 22\
              \ \xB0C for 24 h. Stars denote significant difference compared with\
              \ glucose-based biolixiviants by a Welch\u2019s two-sample t-test, where,\
              \ p < 0.05 (*), p < 0.01 (**), p < 0.001 (***).Despite a 28% average\
              \ reduction in Mg leaching, we were unable to detect a statistically\
              \ meaningful difference between glucose- and CH-based leaching of Mg\
              \ using a Welch\u2019s two-sample t-test. This was due to the small\
              \ sample size and variability in CH-based biolixiviant leachate measurements.\
              \ Data collected for CH-based biolixiviants resulted in greater variability\
              \ than data with glucose-based biolixiviants. ICP-MS analysis of cellulosic\
              \ hydrolysate samples showed that the CH used in this study contains\
              \ trace concentrations of metals, possibly as a result of the manufacturing\
              \ process (Table S4). When calculating the amounts of metal leached\
              \ from CH-based biolixiviants, the concentrations of metal in a cellulosic\
              \ hydrolysate control study were subtracted from the total detected\
              \ to eliminate metal concentrations that were not extracted from dunite.\
              \ In low pulp density studies, the concentrations of metals in the cellulosic\
              \ hydrolysate feedstock interfered with metals leached, resulting in\
              \ higher overall error.Cellulosic hydrolysate produced from corn stover\
              \ contains several toxins such as organic acids, furan derivatives,\
              \ and phenolic compounds that could inhibit the growth of G. oxydans\
              \ and its production of biolixiviant70. Cellulosic hydrolysate also\
              \ significantly increases viscosity, resulting in lower oxygen transfer\
              \ rates that limit the fermentation of glucose to gluconic acid68. Despite\
              \ this, leaching results show that G. oxydans can produce a biolixiviant\
              \ from cellulosic hydrolysate capable of leaching metals at concentrations\
              \ significantly greater than controls; however, further analysis and\
              \ experimentation are needed to show if CH can be a viable replacement\
              \ to glucose without a significant reduction in performance.Although\
              \ cellulosic hydrolysate contains mild antibiotic properties due to\
              \ its acidity and certain toxic compounds, this could be advantageous\
              \ for the industrial scale use of it as a feedstock for biolixiviant\
              \ production. G. oxydans has high acid resistance and is capable of\
              \ growing and producing biolixiviant with cellulosic hydrolysate, while\
              \ many other microbes have low tolerance mechanisms for it. This could\
              \ allow for cellulosic hydrolysate to be used as an ultra-low-cost feedstock\
              \ while also preventing the growth of competing microbes. The toxic\
              \ components of cellulosic hydrolysate could also be a genetic engineering\
              \ target for G. oxydans, where mutants that have better resistance mechanisms\
              \ can be selected for to improve biolixiviant production.G. oxydans\
              \ mutant strain\u0394pstS, P112:mgdh improved magnesium leaching by\
              \ 12% over wild-typeA preliminary study using the mutant strain G. oxydans\
              \ \u0394pstS, P112:mgdh43 shows that under identical growth and leaching\
              \ conditions, mutant strains of G. oxydans can be more effective than\
              \ wild-type in leaching magnesium and energy-critical metals from dunite.A\
              \ bioleaching analysis over 96 h using dunite at 1% pulp density was\
              \ conducted with biolixiviant from wild-type and mutant G. oxydans.\
              \ Bioleachate samples were taken and analyzed every 24 h up to 96 h\
              \ using ICP-MS. The strain used is G. oxydans \u0394pstS, P112:mgdh,\
              \ which was engineered to improve acid production for metal leaching43.\
              \ It contains a clean deletion of the pstS gene which is involved in\
              \ phosphate signaling and transport44, and an up-regulation with promoter\
              \ P112 of the mgdh gene (Membrane-bound Glucose DeHydrogenase) which\
              \ is critical for converting glucose into gluconic acid71. The \u0394\
              pstS, P112:mgdh mutant was previously shown to decrease the pH of biolixiviants\
              \ compared to wild-type, and it increases the overall leaching of REE43.\
              \ The biolixiviant produced from the \u0394pstS, P112:mgdh mutant had\
              \ a pH of 2.01 \xB1 0.02 across all replicates, while the pH of wild-type\
              \ biolixiviants were 2.39 \xB1 0.02.The analysis shows that \u0394pstS,\
              \ P112:mgdh mutant biolixiviant increases magnesium leaching by an average\
              \ of 12% over all samples taken between 24 and 96 h of leaching. Mn,\
              \ Fe, Co, and Ni had an average improvement in leaching of 12% using\
              \ mutant biolixiviant compared to wild-type (Fig. 6).Fig. 6Bioleaching\
              \ efficiency of magnesium increased by an average of 12% when leaching\
              \ with a high performingG. oxydans mutant. The G. oxydans mutant contains\
              \ a deletion of pstS phosphate signaling and transport gene, alongside\
              \ up-regulation of the mgdh gene that codes for the Membrane-bound Glucose\
              \ DeHydrogenase (MGDH) with the P112 promoter (G. oxydans \u0394pstS,\
              \ P112:mdgh). Leaching was done with dunite at 1% pulp density shaking\
              \ at 22 \xB0C over 96 h. Stars and dots denote a statistically significant\
              \ difference between wild-type G. oxydans and G. oxydans \u0394pstS,\

              \ (.), p < 0.05 (*), p < 0.01 (**), p < 0.001 (***).The entire genome\
              \ of G. oxydans is yet to be completely characterized, and several other\
              \ genes may exist that are critical in controlling metal leaching from\
              \ ultramafic rocks. Future work to characterize the genome of G. oxydans\
              \ in terms of its functions related to ultramafic leaching is vital\
              \ to engineer better mutant strains that can improve the performance\
              \ of bio-accelerated weathering. The \u0394pstS, P112:mgdh mutant is\
              \ engineered to maximize gluconic acid production; however, studies\
              \ have shown that for rare earths leaching, G. oxydans mutants can be\
              \ screened to identify genes that specifically affect rare earth extraction50.\
              \ Our research group has created a quality-controlled (QC) whole genome\
              \ knockout collection for G. oxydans B58, containing a collection of\
              \ 2,733 transposon disruption mutants, each with a different nonessential\
              \ gene disrupted. This QC collection enables a high-throughput screen\
              \ of the G. oxydans genome, selecting for significant changes to dunite\
              \ leaching efficacy. This will provide us with a roadmap for genetically\
              \ engineering G. oxydans for greater ultramafic bio-accelerated weathering\
              \ capability.G. oxydans biolixiviants are 3.2\xD7 more effective than\
              \ gluconic acid at 60% pulp densityAt higher pulp densities and longer\
              \ leaching times, Gluconobacter oxydans biolixiviants significantly\
              \ outperformed gluconic acid at the same pH. We compared Gluconobacter\
              \ oxydans biolixiviants and gluconic acid metal leaching with 5%, 10%,\
              \ and 60% dunite pulp density, where leachate metal concentrations were\
              \ measured every 24 h for 72 h. The gluconic acid was diluted with ultrapure\
              \ deionized water to match the pH of biolixiviants, and leaching was\
              \ performed in identical conditions with the same mineral substrates\
              \ (DUN-2). After 72 h of leaching, wild-type biolixiviants leached 1.74\

              \ At higher dunite pulp densities, the improvement of Gluconobacter\
              \ oxydans biolixiviants compared to gluconic acid was amplified. After\

              \ the price per unit mass of the feedstock.In this work, we succeeded\
              \ in reducing kseq from 525 to 1.0 (almost 3 orders of magnitude) (Fig.\
              \ 8). With 1% dunite and 24 h of leaching, the approximate kseq is 525\
              \ carbon invested/magnesium leached. One method to reduce kseq is to\
              \ increase the time of leaching. After 96 h of leaching, the magnesium\
              \ concentration increased by 81% when compared to 24 h leaching at the\
              \ same pulp density (Fig. 3). When increasing the time of leaching to\
              \ 10 days, the magnesium concentration improved by an average of 147%\
              \ (Fig. 8). Increasing the pulp density of dunite also reduces kseq.\
              \ When compared to 1% pulp density of dunite, increasing to 10% pulp\
              \ density resulted in a 5-fold increase in magnesium leaching after\
              \ 24 h (Fig. 8). When combining 10% pulp density with 10 days of leaching,\
              \ magnesium leaching increased by 9.2 times that of 1% pulp density\
              \ leached for 1 day (Fig. 8), resulting in a kseq of 57, since glucose\
              \ input remained unchanged. For the lowest kseq values achieved, fine-particle\
              \ dunite at a pulp density of 60% was leached for 19 days with three\
              \ different methods (Fig. 8 Leaching Attempts #12\u201314). The first\
              \ method (Fig. 8 Leaching Attempt #12) was direct addition of 60% dunite,\
              \ the second method (Leaching Attempt #13) was a 2-step dunite addition,\
              \ where 30% dunite was added on day 0 and another 30% added on day 10,\
              \ and the third method (Leaching Attempt #14) was a 2-step dunite addition\
              \ where the first 30% dunite feed was removed from the leachate before\
              \ the second 30% addition on day 10. All three leaching methods resulted\
              \ in a kseq equal to or less than 1.0, with the lowest kseq being 0.96\
              \ on Leaching Attempt #13 in Fig. 8.Fig. 8Process and genetic improvements\
              \ reduce the amount of feedstock carbon needed to potentially sequester\
              \ one CO2 molecule from 525 to 1. Increasing leaching time, pulp density,\
              \ and reducing average particle sizes were able to reduce kseq (glucose\
              \ carbon investment vs. carbon sequestration ratio) by several orders\
              \ of magnitude. Increasing dunite pulp density from 1\u201310% had a\
              \ larger impact in reducing kseq than increasing leaching time from\
              \ 1 to 10 days. Combining the \u0394pstS, P112:mdgh double mutant with\
              \ high pulp densities and long leaching times resulted in a kseq value\
              \ of 1 in three experiments (Col. 10\u201312). Leaching attempts #1\u2013\
              9 used DUN-1 and attempts #10\u201312 used DUN-3 with a particle size\
              \ of less than 74 microns as the leaching substrate.What implications\
              \ do these results have for CO2 sequestration? For kseq = 525, when\
              \ using glucose as a feedstock, the cost of sequestering 1 tonne of\
              \ CO2 is $358,000, a long way above the US Department of Energy\u2019\
              s (DOE) target of $100 per tonne72, and well above existing technologies31.\
              \ On the other hand, if we could reduce kseq to 1 (as in Fig. 8) at\
              \ industrial scale, the cost of carbon sequestration (at least the microbial\
              \ feedstock part of the cost) through bio-accelerated weathering starts\
              \ to become comparable to (still high) current technologies, at $682\
              \ per tonne31. If we could reduce kseq to 0.15 (about a 6-fold reduction\
              \ over our best attempt, much smaller than the reduction we achieved\
              \ in the course of writing this article) then we could reduce the feedstock\
              \ cost for sequestering 1 tonne of CO2 to $100. This would not account\
              \ for the costs of mining ultramafic material, but nor does it account\
              \ for the offset cost of energy-critical metal recovery. However, using\
              \ this to sequester 20 gigatonnes of CO2 a year5 would require 2 billion\
              \ tonnes of glucose, over 10 times current global annual sugar production73.Sugars\
              \ derived from cellulosic biomass are potentially much more abundant\
              \ than glucose that is derived from cereal crops like corn, sugar cane,\
              \ and sugar beet74. While there is no widespread production of cellulosic\
              \ sugars today that is not immediately diverted to cellulosic ethanol\
              \ production, this could happen in the future. Furthermore, it is estimated\
              \ that cellulosic sugar production could be as low as $100 per tonne75\
              \ (in contrast to around $1,000 per tonne for glucose). Although cellulosic\
              \ sugars are abundant, they are not limitless. Slade et al.76, made\
              \ estimates of global bioenergy supply, and concluded that several tipping\
              \ points would occur as the amount of biomass withdrawn from the biosphere\
              \ for bioenergy (or some other chemical production, such as carbon sequestration)\
              \ increased, forcing increasingly unpalatable choices on global society\
              \ including mass adoption of vegetarian diets, mass deforestation, population\
              \ control, or combinations thereof. Their analysis suggests that the\
              \ first global agricultural tipping point (choosing one of the three\
              \ unpalatable options) would occur when biomass was withdrawn at a rate\
              \ of around 7 gigatonnes per year62. Assuming that cellulosic sugars\
              \ are on average a 50:50 mix of C5 and C6 sugars, then to reduce the\
              \ cellulosic biomass demand to sequester 20 gigatonnes of CO2 to 3.5\
              \ gigatonnes, kseq needs only to be reduced to 0.25.Although kseq serves\
              \ as a useful metric for displaying sugar investment in terms of CO2\
              \ sequestration potential, it is only a theoretical value whose real\
              \ value will depend on the conversion rates of downstream CO2 mineralization.\
              \ Since glucose inputs are a major cost driver in bio-accelerated weathering61,\
              \ kseq can help estimate lower-limit costs of scaled operations. Future\
              \ scale-up work will be necessary to formulate more accurate estimates\
              \ of cost before they can be compared with other direct CO2 mineralization\
              \ technologies.Possibilities for downstream carbon mineralizationOn\
              \ its own, G. oxydans bioleachate saturated with magnesium ions will\
              \ be difficult to convert into stable carbonate minerals. Due to the\
              \ nature of acid leaching, the final pH of biolixiviants post-leaching\
              \ tended to be low (4\u20135) in our experiments, making carbon mineralization\
              \ chemically unfavorable. Since pH has a significant influence on the\
              \ precipitation of carbonates due to the lower availability of carbonate\
              \ ions in acidic conditions77,78, pH adjustments are required to increase\
              \ carbonate mineral yields downstream. Increasing the concentration\
              \ of gaseous CO2 injected or sparged through the leachate increases\
              \ the total dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC); however, this reduces\
              \ the pH of the leachate, reducing carbonate ion availability and decreasing\
              \ the saturation index of carbonate minerals2,77.A possible downstream\
              \ pathway to adjust the pH of leachates to make carbon dioxide complexation\
              \ chemically favorable is to add ammonia from biological or natural\
              \ sources to synthesize magnesite, MgCO3, or nesquehonite, MgCO3\xB7\
              3H2O. Adding ammonia to CO2-sparged magnesium chloride solutions at\
              \ ambient temperatures was shown to completely convert free magnesium\
              \ ions into nesquehonite in about ten minutes79. Furthermore, ammonia\
              \ can be recycled in this process through recovery of ammonia using\
              \ activated carbon, which has been shown to recover ammonium chloride\
              \ salts and separate them into ammonia and hydrochloric acid at near\
              \ ambient conditions80. Another possibility is to simply add sodium\
              \ hydroxide that has been electrically synthesized from carbon-neutral\
              \ pathways.Microbes that accelerate carbon mineralization, such as cyanobacteria,\
              \ have been observed to accelerate mineralization in legacy alkaline\
              \ mine tailings34,35. Coupling bio-accelerated weathering from Gluconobacter\
              \ oxydans with biotic downstream processes could maximize carbonate\
              \ precipitation in a low-resource and energy-efficient process that\
              \ could be genetically engineered further.Scale-Up and future stepsIn\
              \ order to show that bio-accelerated weathering is a feasible option\
              \ for gigatonne-scale CO2 sequestration, future work will be required\
              \ to show that a scaled-up bioprocess is possible without a significant\
              \ reduction in efficiency compared to the bench-scale experiments shown\
              \ here.Bench-scale lab results rarely have equal yields and efficiencies\
              \ when scaled up to pilot- or industrial-scale bioprocesses. Being an\
              \ obligate aerobe, G. oxydans requires air exchange and consistent mixing\
              \ for optimal growth. Furthermore, optimized mixing of the mineral substrate\
              \ with biolixiviants, rate of glucose supplementation, rate of mineral\
              \ addition, and optimized particle sizes for leaching are yet to be\
              \ thoroughly investigated. To address these scale-up challenges, all\
              \ process parameters will need to be investigated in bioreactor experiments.Another\
              \ consideration is how cell viability changes throughout the leaching\
              \ process. G. oxydans has been shown to be resilient in high metal concentrations11,\
              \ unlike several other microbes. However, having high pulp densities\
              \ of dunite would be a growth challenge for G. oxydans. Despite this,\
              \ cell viability during leaching may not be a critical parameter for\
              \ the effectiveness of leaching by G. oxydans biolixiviants. For short\
              \ term leaching, it is shown that having cells present in the biolixiviant\
              \ has an insignificant effect on leaching (Fig. 4). Since biolixiviants\
              \ are produced in an independent step before leaching begins (Figure\
              \ S1), it is not essential to have live cells present during leaching.\
              \ However, possible direct microbe-mineral interactions and continued\
              \ acid production may have an effect on long-term leaching and scaled\
              \ processes.Overcoming the deceleration of leaching over time is also\
              \ a future scale-up challenge to address. The rates of leaching were\
              \ shown to slow down over the 96 h they were monitored (Fig. 3). As\
              \ ultramafic minerals are dissolved by biolixiviants, passivation layers\
              \ can form from amorphous silica (Note S1) or other mineral byproducts.\
              \ Furthermore, as the solution nears saturation of metal cations, dissolution\
              \ rates are expected to stagnate. Future investigations into overcoming\
              \ the passivation layers and developing integrated mineralization technologies\
              \ to allow for continuous leaching will be necessary for scale-up.Utilizing\
              \ lignocellulosic-based sugars as an alternative sugar feedstock also\
              \ poses a challenge in scale-up. Although G. oxydans has been shown\
              \ to effectively produce biolixiviants from cellulosic hydrolysate,\
              \ the state of lignocellulosic sugar production is underdeveloped. Large-scale\
              \ production of sugars derived from second-generation biomass (lignocellulose)\
              \ is still limited, and developments in improving efficiency and yield\
              \ are ongoing. Advances in the supply chain of lignocellulosic biomass\
              \ and optimization in pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis will be\
              \ necessary in the near future for the large-scale implementation of\
              \ lignocellulosic-based sugars for bio-accelerated weathering66.\",\"\
              discussion\":\"ConclusionThis article shows that G. oxydans possesses\
              \ the capability to bioleach metals for energy technologies and carbon\
              \ mineralization from dunite. At low pulp densities (1%), the G. oxydans\
              \ organic acid-based biolixiviant is 20\xD7 more effective at Mg leaching\
              \ than deionized water. At high pulp densities (60%), the biolixiviant\
              \ is 3.2\xD7 better than even gluconic acid alone. This suggests that\
              \ microbially-accelerated weathering of ultramafic materials could be\
              \ an environmentally-friendly method for supplying Mg for mineralization\
              \ of CO2, and metals like Ni and Co for sustainable energy technologies\
              \ at rates that can far exceed equivalent abiotic methods.Several pH\
              \ swing methods have been shown to be highly effective for greatly accelerating\
              \ olivine carbonation7,81. However, scaling up these technologies to\
              \ meet the world\u2019s CO2 removal requirements may involve high energy\
              \ costs82 and environmental drawbacks like those found in strong acid\
              \ leaching involved with large scale energy-critical metal mining. Other\
              \ methods of accelerated weathering involving energy-intensive preprocessing\
              \ of mineral feedstocks by crushing, grinding, and chemically treating\
              \ ultramafic rocks also come with their own environmental and scaling\
              \ drawbacks. In situ accelerated ultramafic weathering can result in\
              \ environmental leaching and environmental drainage of harmful doses\
              \ of nickel, chromium, and cobalt59,83\u201385. These methods also involve\
              \ slow kinetics that depend on high energy inputs to be accelerated\
              \ and enormous land use7,28,82,86.Bio-accelerated weathering may be\
              \ an alternative approach to mineral weathering for carbon mineralization.\
              \ When engineered further, this strategy may prove an economically-viable\
              \ and scalable option that avoids the environmental concerns with in\
              \ situ mechanically-accelerated weathering and strong acid leaching51,59,84,85,87,\
              \ as well as the energy costs involved in high temperature and pressure\
              \ reactions14,82. Energy requirements for heating in common abiotic\
              \ carbonation processes, such as ammonium salts-driven pH swings and\
              \ HCl pH swings, often result in CO2 emissions greater than the amount\
              \ sequestered82. G. oxydans-based bioleaching was shown to be effective\
              \ at ambient temperature and pressure, removing a major energy burden\
              \ for this process.In this article, we were able to reduce the number\
              \ of carbon atoms in glucose needed to sequester one molecule of CO2\
              \ from 525 to 1. However, further work needs to be done to optimize\
              \ G. oxydans for enhanced weathering for carbon mineralization. Maximizing\
              \ the leaching of magnesium while minimizing carbon inputs and lowering\
              \ the economic costs are key steps to making this technology viable\
              \ for eliminating the several gigatonnes of carbon dioxide in excess\
              \ on our planet.\",\"methods\":\"Electronic supplementary materialBelow\

        \ rocks are an abundant source of cations for CO2 mineralization (e.g., Mg)\
        \ and elements for sustainability technologies (e.g., Ni, Cr, Mn, Co, Al).\
        \ However, there is no industrially useful process for dissolving ultramafic\
        \ materials to release cations for CO2 sequestration or mining them for energy-critical\
        \ elements. Weathering of ultramafic rocks by rainwater, release of metal\
        \ cations, and subsequent CO2 mineralization already naturally sequesters\
        \ CO2 from the atmosphere, but this natural process will take thousands to\
        \ hundreds of thousands of years to remove excess anthropogenic CO2, far too\
        \ late to deal with global warming that will happen over the next century.\
        \ Mechanical acceleration of weathering by grinding can accelerate cation\
        \ release but is prohibitively expensive. In this article we show that gluconic\
        \ acid-based lixiviants produced by the mineral-dissolving microbe Gluconobacter\
        \ oxydans accelerate leaching of Mg2+ by 20\xD7 over deionized water, and\
        \ that leaching of Mg, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni further improves by 73% from 24\
        \ to 96 h. At low pulp density (1%) the G. oxydans biolixiviant is only 6%\
        \ more effective than gluconic acid. But, at 60% pulp density the G. oxydans\
        \ biolixiviant is 3.2\xD7 more effective than just gluconic acid. We demonstrate\
        \ that biolixiviants made with cellulosic hydrolysate are not significantly\
        \ worse than biolixiviants made with glucose, dramatically improving the feedstock\
        \ available for bioleaching. Finally, we demonstrate that we can reduce the\
        \ number of carbon atoms in the biolixiviant feedstock (e.g., glucose or cellulosic\
        \ hydrolysate) needed to release one Mg2+ ion and mineralize one atom of carbon\
        \ from CO2 from 525 to 1.\\n## Supplementary Information\\nThe online version\

        n\\n## Introduction\\n\\nThe accumulation of over a trillion tonnes of anthropogenic\
        \ CO2 in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere1\u20134 driving global climate change\
        \ is one of the most pressing challenges of our time. To address this, the\
        \ IPCC\u2019s Special Report in 2018 stresses the necessity of deploying carbon\
        \ dioxide removal (CDR) technology capable of removing tens of gigatonnes\
        \ of CO2 from the atmosphere annually, paired with carbon-neutral energy technologies\
        \ to prevent global warming from exceeding 1.5\u02DAC above pre-industrial\
        \ levels5.\\n\\nMineralization of CO2 is a highly attractive approach for\
        \ permanent sequestration of CO2, as it converts atmospheric carbon into solid\
        \ minerals as a permanent sink6,7. Carbon mineralization proceeds through\
        \ a two-step process. First, ultramafic rocks are dissolved by weathering\
        \ to release magnesium cations (Note S1). In the second step, magnesium ions\
        \ are reacted with dissolved carbonate to form magnesite (MgCO3), a stable\
        \ mineral that permanently stores CO28 (Note S1). A schematic of a proposed\
        \ indirect carbonation method is shown in Fig. 1.Fig. 1Proposed system for\
        \ bio-accelerated weathering of ultramafic materials for carbon mineralization.\
        \ This work focuses on the rate-limiting step, the metal leaching stage (enclosed\
        \ in red box), where G. oxydans biolixiviant leaches magnesium ions and other\
        \ metals from dunite. Downstream carbonation results in magnesite formation\
        \ for CO2 storage, and metal recovery done chemically or electrochemically\
        \ can extract energy-critical metals for commercial use.\\n\\nNaturally occurring\
        \ weathering of ultramafic rocks and subsequent carbon mineralization is thought\
        \ to be responsible for removal of up to hundreds of millions of tonnes of\
        \ CO2 each year8\u201311. In fact, because ultramafic rocks are so abundant12,13,\
        \ reaction of all of the metal cations in all surface-accessible ultramafic\
        \ material could capture 100 trillion tonnes of CO2 as carbonate minerals14\
        \ (at least 58\xD7 the excess CO2 in the atmosphere), making them a strong\
        \ candidate for gigatonne-scale CDR15,8,16. However, natural carbon mineralization\
        \ is partially offset by oxidation of rock organic carbon11,17. As a result,\
        \ the time to naturally regulate atmospheric CO2 levels is estimated to be\
        \ between tens and hundreds of thousands of years8,11,18\u201320.\\n\\nThe\
        \ large-scale deployment of carbon-neutral energy technologies will also be\
        \ necessary to control climate change5, but it will require vast quantities\
        \ of metals21. In addition to metal cations needed for CO2 sequestration,\
        \ ultramafic minerals are a potential low-grade ore source for energy-critical\
        \ metals such as nickel (batteries and stainless steel), chromium (concentrated\
        \ solar and geothermal energy), manganese (steel and batteries), cobalt (batteries),\
        \ and copper (wiring and wind turbines)8,21\u201325 (Figure S2, Tables S1\
        \ and S2). This presents an opportunity to extract energy-critical metals\
        \ from ultramafic rock while sequestering CO2.\\n\\nHowever, extracting metals\
        \ from ultramafic rocks poses a significant challenge. In aqueous mineral\
        \ carbonation, the rate of carbon mineralization is limited by the slow kinetics\
        \ of the leaching of metal ions from ultramafic sources14,26,27. While mechanical\
        \ acceleration of ultramafic weathering through crushing, grinding, heating,\
        \ chemically treating, and spreading over land is promising for its high sequestration\
        \ potential and improved kinetics8,16,28\u201330, it requires large area footprints\
        \ and high energy inputs involved in crushing, grinding, heating, and pressurizing,\
        \ making it prohibitively expensive31. Likewise, technologies to extract the\
        \ energy-critical elements present in low concentration in ultramafic rocks\
        \ present formidable economic and environmental challenges24,32,33.\\n\\nWe\
        \ hypothesize that microbially-accelerated mineral dissolution could overcome\
        \ the slow kinetics and high costs14 of the dissolution of ultramafic material,\
        \ releasing magnesium ions at a rate several orders of magnitude greater than\
        \ in nature34,35. Over the past two decades, microbial mineral dissolution\
        \ has revolutionized mining copper and gold from low-grade ores\u2014a process\
        \ known as biomining. Bacteria such as Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans and\
        \ related species are responsible for producing about 15% of the world\u2019\
        s copper supply and about 5% of its gold supply36 through iron-redox-mediated\
        \ bioleaching, a process in which microbes alter the redox state of metals\
        \ to extract them from mineral substrates37,38. Significant research has been\
        \ performed to improve industrial-scale Cu bioleaching with consortia including\
        \ A. ferrooxidans and non-domesticated microbes, resulting in processes that\
        \ are fairly mature. While copper biomining is the only industrialized biomining\
        \ process, organisms and processes are in development for rare earth elements\
        \ (REE)39\u201344 and lithium45,46.\\n\\nBiolixiviants produced by Gluconobacter\
        \ oxydans are a strong candidate for a sustainable and strong catalyst for\
        \ CO2 mineralization using ultramafic rocks11,47. A recent study from our\
        \ team comparing the dunite dissolution performance of three mineral-dissolving\
        \ microbes, Gluconobacter oxydans, Sphingomonas desiccabilis, and Penicillium\
        \ simplicissimum, concludes that G. oxydans outperformed the other two in\
        \ the extraction of all metals from dunite11.\\n\\nG. oxydans efficiently\
        \ produces a gluconic acid-based mineral-dissolving solution, called a biolixiviant,\
        \ when glucose is present47,48. Previous studies have shown that biolixiviants\
        \ from G. oxydans can be more effective than just gluconic acid at leaching\
        \ REE42,49. In a recent article, our team identified genes that control the\
        \ effectiveness of the G. oxydans biolixiviant at dissolving neodymium phosphate\
        \ (synthetic monazite) but do not notably change its pH50. These results suggest\
        \ that biologically-produced lixiviants could contain additional components,\
        \ such as metal chelators, redox molecules, and flavins that improve overall\
        \ metal leaching at fixed pH, allowing for more efficient and low-resource\
        \ metal leaching. This could avoid the use of strong acids that can have harmful\
        \ environmental effects such as acid mine drainage51.\\n\\nSecond, it is suspected\
        \ that microbes interact with ultramafic materials in the wild, accelerating\
        \ weathering processes52\u201355. Furthermore, laboratory mixed cultures have\
        \ been shown to dissolve ultramafic material56. Meanwhile, in two companion\
        \ articles, we demonstrate that three easily culturable isolated species (G.\
        \ oxydans, Penicillium simplicissimum and Sphingomonas desiccabilis) can all\
        \ accelerate the dissolution of ultramafic material11 and characterize mineral\
        \ phase transformations due to bioleaching by G. oxydans57.\\n\\nHowever,\
        \ there has been little systematic study of microbial dissolution of ultramafic\
        \ minerals. Furthermore, it remains unclear under what conditions a biolixiviant\
        \ could be more effective than just an organic acid and why; could genetic\
        \ engineering improve ultramafic bioleaching; what impact process parameters\
        \ have on biological dissolution of ultramafic materials; the extraction efficiencies\
        \ for energy critical elements; utilization of low-cost feedstock; and the\
        \ carbon source demand of large-scale ultramafic bioleaching. To address these\
        \ knowledge gaps, we provide some of the first systematic observations of\
        \ dissolution of ultramafic minerals by the mineral-dissolving microbe, G.\
        \ oxydans B58.\\n\\n## Results and discussion\\n\\nIn this work, we perform\
        \ a study of G. oxydans bioleaching capability on dunite, an ultramafic rock\
        \ composed of greater than 90% olivine (see composition in Figure S2, and\
        \ Tables S1 and S2). For accelerated weathering technologies, olivine-rich\
        \ dunite is the preferred feedstock due to olivine having the highest CO2\
        \ sequestration potential by mass, excellent carbonation kinetics, and high\
        \ abundance58,59.\\n\\nThis study benchmarks the bioleaching efficacy of glucose-based\
        \ and lignocellulosic sugar-based biolixiviants produced by G. oxydans on\
        \ dunite, comparing conditions of whole-cell and filtered (cell-free) biolixiviants,\
        \ varying pulp densities, aerobic and anaerobic conditions, and short-term\
        \ and long-term leaching. This study also investigates how a high-performing\
        \ mutant strain of G. oxydans could improve leaching in ultramafic minerals,\
        \ serving as a preliminary study of how genetic engineering could further\
        \ improve bioleaching for carbon mineralization. We demonstrate that the effectiveness\
        \ advantage of the G. oxydans biolixiviant over gluconic acid alone grows\
        \ with increasing pulp density. Finally, we demonstrate that the number of\
        \ carbon atoms that need to be supplied by sugar feedstocks can be reduced\
        \ to match the number of carbon atoms potentially sequestered as a mineral.\\\

        \ since it estimates the improvements made by bio-accelerated leaching to\
        \ leaching from environmental water sources, such as rainwater. In traditional\
        \ accelerated carbon mineralization with ultramafic rocks, crushed rocks are\
        \ dispersed over land, where water from the environment is the solvent for\
        \ magnesium8,29,30. Comparing the concentrations of magnesium between leaching\
        \ with biolixiviants and water provides a rough estimate for the order of\
        \ magnitude in which carbon mineralization is accelerated by G. oxydans.\\\
        n\\nAfter 24 h of leaching with dunite at 1% pulp density, magnesium was leached\
        \ with an extraction efficiency of 11% (300 ppm), corresponding to an increase\
        \ of 20\xD7 when compared to the deionized water control (Fig. 2A). The pH\
        \ of wild-type biolixiviants was 2.39 \xB1 0.02 across all experiments using\
        \ wild-type biolixiviants. At the start of each leaching experiment, the initial\
        \ concentrations of all metals in biolixiviants and controls are below detection\
        \ limits. Figure S3 shows how the metal concentrations in controls and G.\
        \ oxydans leachates diverge within the first few hours of leaching, starting\
        \ with initial metal concentrations of zero.Fig. 2Leaching dunite at 1% pulp\
        \ density with wild-type (WT)G. oxydans biolixiviant improves leaching of\
        \ magnesium by 20-fold when compared to leaching with deionized water (control).\
        \ However, the G. oxydans biolixiviant is only 6% better than just gluconic\
        \ acid at the same pH. Bioleaching of dunite at 1% pulp density shaking at\
        \ 22 \u02DAC for 24 h was performed with wild-type G. oxydans biolixiviant,\
        \ gluconic acid diluted to the same pH with deionized water, and a deionized\
        \ water control. Panels (A) to (E) show leaching concentrations and extraction\
        \ efficiencies of Mg, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni. Wild-type G. oxydans biolixiviants\
        \ slightly improved metal leaching compared to gluconic acid across all metals.\
        \ Stars denote significant difference between gluconic acid leaching and wild-type\
        \ biolixiviant leaching by a Welch\u2019s two-sample t-test, where, p < 0.05\
        \ (*), p < 0.01 (**), p < 0.001 (***).\\n\\n### Bioleaching of metals byG.\
        \ oxydans increases by 73% from 24 to 96 h\\n\\nThe most efficiently extracted\
        \ metal at 24 h was Mn (Fig. 2B), extracting over 15% of Mn from dunite (corresponding\
        \ to a leachate concentration of 1.6 ppm). Fe, Co, and Ni were also leached\
        \ highly, with efficiencies between 11% and 15% (Figs. 2C, D, and E, respectively).\
        \ Al and Cr were also leached, but much less efficiently (Figure S4). Cr was\
        \ the least efficiently extracted metal, with extraction of no more than 0.3%\
        \ under any condition (Figure S4 right column). We speculate that chromium\
        \ is significantly less leached since the chromite inclusions within dunite\
        \ are relatively more stable than olivine and resistant to acid dissolution60.\\\
        n\\nWhen leaching for longer than 24 h, bioleaching efficiency continues to\
        \ increase (Fig. 3). In a 96-hour bioleaching analysis of dunite at 1% pulp\
        \ density, bioleaching increased between 24 and 96 h by an average of 73%\
        \ for Mg, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni (Fig. 3). After 96 h, the leaching of magnesium\
        \ in biolixiviant is 42 times that of water (Fig. 3). This shows that biolixiviants\
        \ from G. oxydans improve the overall leaching of metals at a rate faster\
        \ than water.Fig. 3Increasing leaching time to 96 h increases extraction efficiency\
        \ by an average of 73% between 24 and 96 h for Mg, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni. Biolixiviants\
        \ from wild-type G. oxydans leached dunite at 1% pulp density for 96 h, shaking\
        \ at 22 \xB0C. Mg, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni concentrations were measured from leachates\
        \ every 24 h for 96 h. Error bars indicate standard deviation of measurements\
        \ from duplicate measurements.\\n\\n### TheG. oxydans biolixiviant is only\
        \ 6% better than gluconic acid at 1% pulp density\\n\\nA secondary control\
        \ was performed using only gluconic acid diluted with deionized water to the\
        \ same pH as the acid biolixiviants produced by G. oxydans. Reed et al.42\
        \ and Antonick et al.49 demonstrated that biolixiviants produced by G. oxydans\
        \ were noticeably more effective at bioleaching than gluconic acid alone.\
        \ However, recent anecdotal evidence suggests this is not the case under all\
        \ conditions. In our hands, when bioleaching ultramafic materials at low pulp\
        \ density (1%), G. oxydans-produced biolixiviants only slightly outperform\
        \ gluconic acid in leaching most metals (Fig. 2). Wild-type G. oxydans biolixiviants\
        \ leached only 6% more magnesium compared to pure gluconic acid that was diluted\
        \ with ultrapure water to the same pH after 24 h of leaching. Furthermore,\
        \ at least with low pulp density leaching, filtering cells from the biolixiviant\
        \ did not significantly affect bioleaching, at least under the conditions\
        \ of these tests (Fig. 4). This was done to assess if there was a significant\
        \ residual effect of microbial activity on leaching after biolixiviant production.\
        \ Furthermore, stoppering flasks during leaching to prevent gas exchange did\
        \ not significantly affect bioleaching (Figure S5). Later in the article,\
        \ we ask if there are conditions under which the G. oxydans biolixiviant has\
        \ a significant performance advantage for bioleaching ultramafic materials.Fig.\
        \ 4Filtering cells from theG. oxydans biolixiviant does not notably reduce\
        \ the bioleaching of metals from dunite after 24-hour leaching. We compared\
        \ Bioleaching of 1% dunite by sugar water (col. 1), with whole cell lixiviant\
        \ (col. 2), and with a biolixiviant that was clarified by filtration with\
        \ a 0.22 \u03BCm syringe filter (col. 3). Filtered and unfiltered biolixiviants\
        \ were at identical pH, produced from duplicate colonies, and were added to\
        \ ultramafic minerals in identical conditions. Filtering biolixiviants before\
        \ bioleaching resulted in similar metal concentrations when compared to whole-cell\
        \ biolixiviants when leaching dunite. A Welch\u2019s two-sample t-test shows\
        \ that no significant difference was detected between the unfiltered and filtered\
        \ groups, with p-values ranging from 0.2 to 0.9. This indicates that based\
        \ on a 24-hour leaching study, the presence of G. oxydans does not significantly\
        \ improve or diminish the effect of the biolixiviant on leaching in short\
        \ term leaching.\\n\\n### Cellulosic hydrolysate can be used as an alternative\
        \ sugar feedstock for bioleaching\\n\\nTechno-economic analysis shows that\
        \ glucose feedstock for biolixiviant production is the biggest cost driver\
        \ in REE biomining with G. oxydans, accounting for almost half of the total\
        \ cost61. Furthermore, the sheer scale that carbon sequestration needs to\
        \ operate at, means that enormous amounts of feedstock will be required, potentially\
        \ placing a significant demand on the world\u2019s biomass supply62.\\n\\\
        nLignocellulose, found in agricultural waste, can be a renewable carbon source\
        \ for microbial growth and production once monomeric sugars are released through\
        \ acid pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis, making a glucose-rich cellulosic\
        \ hydrolysate63,64. Lignocellulosic sugars are being increasingly investigated\
        \ as a potential alternative sugar source for several applications, including\
        \ biofuels/bioethanol production and substrates for cellular production. Utilizing\
        \ lignocellulose-derived sugars could serve as a high glucose replacement\
        \ feedstock that would greatly improve the cost-efficiency of bioleaching\
        \ for carbon capture technologies65,66. G. oxydans has been shown to be able\
        \ to convert the glucose and xylose sugars in cellulosic hydrolysate into\
        \ gluconic acid and xylonic acid at extremely high efficiencies67\u201369.\
        \ Replacing pure glucose with cellulosic hydrolysate could further improve\
        \ the economic and environmental viability of bio-accelerated weathering.\\\
        n\\nG. oxydans has been shown to efficiently produce gluconic acid and xylonic\
        \ acid from lignocellulosic hydrolysate feedstocks67\u201369, making industrial-scale,\
        \ bio-accelerated carbon mineralization far more economically feasible. We\
        \ investigated if biolixiviants produced from cellulosic hydrolysate, rather\
        \ than pure glucose, could be effective at leaching dunite. The cellulosic\
        \ hydrolysate (CH) used in this study is a glucose-rich solution produced\
        \ from the enzymatic hydrolysis of concentrated corn stover (Table S3).\\\
        n\\nBiolixiviants produced from cellulosic hydrolysate were on average 28%\
        \ less effective in leaching magnesium compared to glucose-based biolixiviants\
        \ (Fig. 5). Leaching of Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni was also reduced by an average\
        \ of 52% compared to glucose-based biolixiviants (Fig. 5). Dunite was added\
        \ at 1% pulp density, and a leaching comparison between CH-based and glucose-based\
        \ lixiviants was conducted in parallel and in identical conditions. The cellulosic\
        \ hydrolysate added was diluted with deionized water so that the total sugar\
        \ concentrations were equal to the amount of glucose added for glucose-based\
        \ biolixiviants.Fig. 5Use of cellulosic hydrolysate as a biolixiviant feedstock\
        \ does not considerably reduce bioleaching efficiency. Panels (A) to (E) show\
        \ comparison of bioleaching of Mg, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni by Gluconobacter oxydans\
        \ when using glucose and cellulosic hydrolysate (CH) as as biolixiviant feedstock.\
        \ CH-based biolixiviant leaches magnesium on average at 72% the efficacy of\
        \ glucose-based biolixiviant. Leaching was performed with 1% dunite shaking\
        \ at 22 \xB0C for 24 h. Stars denote significant difference compared with\
        \ glucose-based biolixiviants by a Welch\u2019s two-sample t-test, where,\
        \ p < 0.05 (*), p < 0.01 (**), p < 0.001 (***).\\n\\nDespite a 28% average\
        \ reduction in Mg leaching, we were unable to detect a statistically meaningful\
        \ difference between glucose- and CH-based leaching of Mg using a Welch\u2019\
        s two-sample t-test. This was due to the small sample size and variability\
        \ in CH-based biolixiviant leachate measurements. Data collected for CH-based\
        \ biolixiviants resulted in greater variability than data with glucose-based\
        \ biolixiviants. ICP-MS analysis of cellulosic hydrolysate samples showed\
        \ that the CH used in this study contains trace concentrations of metals,\
        \ possibly as a result of the manufacturing process (Table S4). When calculating\
        \ the amounts of metal leached from CH-based biolixiviants, the concentrations\
        \ of metal in a cellulosic hydrolysate control study were subtracted from\
        \ the total detected to eliminate metal concentrations that were not extracted\
        \ from dunite. In low pulp density studies, the concentrations of metals in\
        \ the cellulosic hydrolysate feedstock interfered with metals leached, resulting\
        \ in higher overall error.\\n\\nCellulosic hydrolysate produced from corn\
        \ stover contains several toxins such as organic acids, furan derivatives,\
        \ and phenolic compounds that could inhibit the growth of G. oxydans and its\
        \ production of biolixiviant70. Cellulosic hydrolysate also significantly\
        \ increases viscosity, resulting in lower oxygen transfer rates that limit\
        \ the fermentation of glucose to gluconic acid68. Despite this, leaching results\
        \ show that G. oxydans can produce a biolixiviant from cellulosic hydrolysate\
        \ capable of leaching metals at concentrations significantly greater than\
        \ controls; however, further analysis and experimentation are needed to show\
        \ if CH can be a viable replacement to glucose without a significant reduction\
        \ in performance.\\n\\nAlthough cellulosic hydrolysate contains mild antibiotic\
        \ properties due to its acidity and certain toxic compounds, this could be\
        \ advantageous for the industrial scale use of it as a feedstock for biolixiviant\
        \ production. G. oxydans has high acid resistance and is capable of growing\
        \ and producing biolixiviant with cellulosic hydrolysate, while many other\
        \ microbes have low tolerance mechanisms for it. This could allow for cellulosic\
        \ hydrolysate to be used as an ultra-low-cost feedstock while also preventing\
        \ the growth of competing microbes. The toxic components of cellulosic hydrolysate\
        \ could also be a genetic engineering target for G. oxydans, where mutants\
        \ that have better resistance mechanisms can be selected for to improve biolixiviant\
        \ production.\\n\\n### G. oxydans mutant strain\u0394pstS, P112:mgdh improved\
        \ magnesium leaching by 12% over wild-type\\n\\nA preliminary study using\
        \ the mutant strain G. oxydans \u0394pstS, P112:mgdh43 shows that under identical\
        \ growth and leaching conditions, mutant strains of G. oxydans can be more\
        \ effective than wild-type in leaching magnesium and energy-critical metals\
        \ from dunite.\\n\\nA bioleaching analysis over 96 h using dunite at 1% pulp\
        \ density was conducted with biolixiviant from wild-type and mutant G. oxydans.\
        \ Bioleachate samples were taken and analyzed every 24 h up to 96 h using\
        \ ICP-MS. The strain used is G. oxydans \u0394pstS, P112:mgdh, which was engineered\
        \ to improve acid production for metal leaching43. It contains a clean deletion\
        \ of the pstS gene which is involved in phosphate signaling and transport44,\
        \ and an up-regulation with promoter P112 of the mgdh gene (Membrane-bound\
        \ Glucose DeHydrogenase) which is critical for converting glucose into gluconic\
        \ acid71. The \u0394pstS, P112:mgdh mutant was previously shown to decrease\
        \ the pH of biolixiviants compared to wild-type, and it increases the overall\
        \ leaching of REE43. The biolixiviant produced from the \u0394pstS, P112:mgdh\
        \ mutant had a pH of 2.01 \xB1 0.02 across all replicates, while the pH of\
        \ wild-type biolixiviants were 2.39 \xB1 0.02.\\n\\nThe analysis shows that\
        \ \u0394pstS, P112:mgdh mutant biolixiviant increases magnesium leaching by\
        \ an average of 12% over all samples taken between 24 and 96 h of leaching.\
        \ Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni had an average improvement in leaching of 12% using mutant\
        \ biolixiviant compared to wild-type (Fig. 6).Fig. 6Bioleaching efficiency\
        \ of magnesium increased by an average of 12% when leaching with a high performingG.\
        \ oxydans mutant. The G. oxydans mutant contains a deletion of pstS phosphate\
        \ signaling and transport gene, alongside up-regulation of the mgdh gene that\
        \ codes for the Membrane-bound Glucose DeHydrogenase (MGDH) with the P112\
        \ promoter (G. oxydans \u0394pstS, P112:mdgh). Leaching was done with dunite\
        \ at 1% pulp density shaking at 22 \xB0C over 96 h. Stars and dots denote\
        \ a statistically significant difference between wild-type G. oxydans and\
        \ G. oxydans \u0394pstS, P112:mdgh mutant by a Welch\u2019s two-sample t-test,\
        \ where, p < 0.1 (.), p < 0.05 (*), p < 0.01 (**), p < 0.001 (***).\\n\\nThe\
        \ entire genome of G. oxydans is yet to be completely characterized, and several\
        \ other genes may exist that are critical in controlling metal leaching from\
        \ ultramafic rocks. Future work to characterize the genome of G. oxydans in\
        \ terms of its functions related to ultramafic leaching is vital to engineer\
        \ better mutant strains that can improve the performance of bio-accelerated\
        \ weathering. The \u0394pstS, P112:mgdh mutant is engineered to maximize gluconic\
        \ acid production; however, studies have shown that for rare earths leaching,\
        \ G. oxydans mutants can be screened to identify genes that specifically affect\
        \ rare earth extraction50. Our research group has created a quality-controlled\
        \ (QC) whole genome knockout collection for G. oxydans B58, containing a collection\
        \ of 2,733 transposon disruption mutants, each with a different nonessential\
        \ gene disrupted. This QC collection enables a high-throughput screen of the\
        \ G. oxydans genome, selecting for significant changes to dunite leaching\
        \ efficacy. This will provide us with a roadmap for genetically engineering\
        \ G. oxydans for greater ultramafic bio-accelerated weathering capability.\\\
        n\\n### G. oxydans biolixiviants are 3.2\xD7 more effective than gluconic\
        \ acid at 60% pulp density\\n\\nAt higher pulp densities and longer leaching\
        \ times, Gluconobacter oxydans biolixiviants significantly outperformed gluconic\
        \ acid at the same pH. We compared Gluconobacter oxydans biolixiviants and\
        \ gluconic acid metal leaching with 5%, 10%, and 60% dunite pulp density,\
        \ where leachate metal concentrations were measured every 24 h for 72 h. The\
        \ gluconic acid was diluted with ultrapure deionized water to match the pH\
        \ of biolixiviants, and leaching was performed in identical conditions with\
        \ the same mineral substrates (DUN-2). After 72 h of leaching, wild-type biolixiviants\
        \ leached 1.74 times more magnesium than gluconic acid from 5% dunite, 2.87\
        \ times more from 10% dunite, and 3.25 times more from 60% dunite (Fig. 7).\
        \ At higher pulp densities, Gluconobacter oxydans biolixiviants exhibit significantly\
        \ higher leaching efficiency than gluconic acid. This analysis suggests that\
        \ metal leaching from dunite is not only controlled by acidolysis, but might\
        \ contain other biologically-synthesized components that amplify extraction50.Fig.\
        \ 7At 60% pulp density, the wild-typeG. oxydans biolixiviant was 3.2\xD7 more\
        \ effective at bioleaching dunite than gluconic acid diluted to the same pH\
        \ with pure water. A comparative bioleaching study was conducted comparing\
        \ the leaching efficacy of wild-type G. oxydans biolixiviants and just gluconic\
        \ acid at the same pH. Magnesium concentrations in leachate were measured\
        \ after 24, 48, and 72 h of leaching with 5% (A), 10% (B), and 60% (C) dunite\
        \ (DUN-2). At higher dunite pulp densities, the improvement of Gluconobacter\
        \ oxydans biolixiviants compared to gluconic acid was amplified. After 72\
        \ h, biolixiviants were 74% better than gluconic acid at leaching 5% dunite,\
        \ 1.87 times better at leaching 10% dunite, and 2.25 times better at leaching\
        \ 60% dunite. Stars denote significant difference between gluconic acid leaching\
        \ and wild-type biolixiviant leaching by a Welch\u2019s two-sample t-test,\

        \ leaching relative to glucose input can be greatly improved by process and\
        \ genetic engineering\\n\\nGlucose is the cost-limiting factor in utilizing\
        \ G. oxydans biolixiviant as a weathering accelerant61. Furthermore, the sheer\
        \ scale at which carbon sequestration must operate requires enormous amounts\
        \ of microbial feedstock, possibly enough to make a significant demand on\
        \ the world\u2019s biomass supply62. Therefore, it is essential to prioritize\

        \ per unit mass of the feedstock.\\n\\nIn this work, we succeeded in reducing\
        \ kseq from 525 to 1.0 (almost 3 orders of magnitude) (Fig. 8). With 1% dunite\
        \ and 24 h of leaching, the approximate kseq is 525 carbon invested/magnesium\
        \ leached. One method to reduce kseq is to increase the time of leaching.\
        \ After 96 h of leaching, the magnesium concentration increased by 81% when\
        \ compared to 24 h leaching at the same pulp density (Fig. 3). When increasing\
        \ the time of leaching to 10 days, the magnesium concentration improved by\
        \ an average of 147% (Fig. 8). Increasing the pulp density of dunite also\
        \ reduces kseq. When compared to 1% pulp density of dunite, increasing to\
        \ 10% pulp density resulted in a 5-fold increase in magnesium leaching after\
        \ 24 h (Fig. 8). When combining 10% pulp density with 10 days of leaching,\
        \ magnesium leaching increased by 9.2 times that of 1% pulp density leached\
        \ for 1 day (Fig. 8), resulting in a kseq of 57, since glucose input remained\
        \ unchanged. For the lowest kseq values achieved, fine-particle dunite at\
        \ a pulp density of 60% was leached for 19 days with three different methods\
        \ (Fig. 8 Leaching Attempts #12\u201314). The first method (Fig. 8 Leaching\
        \ Attempt #12) was direct addition of 60% dunite, the second method (Leaching\
        \ Attempt #13) was a 2-step dunite addition, where 30% dunite was added on\
        \ day 0 and another 30% added on day 10, and the third method (Leaching Attempt\
        \ #14) was a 2-step dunite addition where the first 30% dunite feed was removed\
        \ from the leachate before the second 30% addition on day 10. All three leaching\
        \ methods resulted in a kseq equal to or less than 1.0, with the lowest kseq\
        \ being 0.96 on Leaching Attempt #13 in Fig. 8.Fig. 8Process and genetic improvements\
        \ reduce the amount of feedstock carbon needed to potentially sequester one\
        \ CO2 molecule from 525 to 1. Increasing leaching time, pulp density, and\
        \ reducing average particle sizes were able to reduce kseq (glucose carbon\
        \ investment vs. carbon sequestration ratio) by several orders of magnitude.\
        \ Increasing dunite pulp density from 1\u201310% had a larger impact in reducing\
        \ kseq than increasing leaching time from 1 to 10 days. Combining the \u0394\
        pstS, P112:mdgh double mutant with high pulp densities and long leaching times\
        \ resulted in a kseq value of 1 in three experiments (Col. 10\u201312). Leaching\
        \ attempts #1\u20139 used DUN-1 and attempts #10\u201312 used DUN-3 with a\
        \ particle size of less than 74 microns as the leaching substrate.\\n\\nWhat\
        \ implications do these results have for CO2 sequestration? For kseq = 525,\
        \ when using glucose as a feedstock, the cost of sequestering 1 tonne of CO2\
        \ is $358,000, a long way above the US Department of Energy\u2019s (DOE) target\
        \ of $100 per tonne72, and well above existing technologies31. On the other\
        \ hand, if we could reduce kseq to 1 (as in Fig. 8) at industrial scale, the\
        \ cost of carbon sequestration (at least the microbial feedstock part of the\
        \ cost) through bio-accelerated weathering starts to become comparable to\
        \ (still high) current technologies, at $682 per tonne31. If we could reduce\
        \ kseq to 0.15 (about a 6-fold reduction over our best attempt, much smaller\
        \ than the reduction we achieved in the course of writing this article) then\
        \ we could reduce the feedstock cost for sequestering 1 tonne of CO2 to $100.\
        \ This would not account for the costs of mining ultramafic material, but\
        \ nor does it account for the offset cost of energy-critical metal recovery.\
        \ However, using this to sequester 20 gigatonnes of CO2 a year5 would require\
        \ 2 billion tonnes of glucose, over 10 times current global annual sugar production73.\\\
        n\\nSugars derived from cellulosic biomass are potentially much more abundant\
        \ than glucose that is derived from cereal crops like corn, sugar cane, and\
        \ sugar beet74. While there is no widespread production of cellulosic sugars\
        \ today that is not immediately diverted to cellulosic ethanol production,\
        \ this could happen in the future. Furthermore, it is estimated that cellulosic\
        \ sugar production could be as low as $100 per tonne75 (in contrast to around\
        \ $1,000 per tonne for glucose). Although cellulosic sugars are abundant,\
        \ they are not limitless. Slade et al.76, made estimates of global bioenergy\
        \ supply, and concluded that several tipping points would occur as the amount\
        \ of biomass withdrawn from the biosphere for bioenergy (or some other chemical\
        \ production, such as carbon sequestration) increased, forcing increasingly\
        \ unpalatable choices on global society including mass adoption of vegetarian\
        \ diets, mass deforestation, population control, or combinations thereof.\
        \ Their analysis suggests that the first global agricultural tipping point\
        \ (choosing one of the three unpalatable options) would occur when biomass\
        \ was withdrawn at a rate of around 7 gigatonnes per year62. Assuming that\
        \ cellulosic sugars are on average a 50:50 mix of C5 and C6 sugars, then to\
        \ reduce the cellulosic biomass demand to sequester 20 gigatonnes of CO2 to\
        \ 3.5 gigatonnes, kseq needs only to be reduced to 0.25.\\n\\nAlthough kseq\
        \ serves as a useful metric for displaying sugar investment in terms of CO2\
        \ sequestration potential, it is only a theoretical value whose real value\
        \ will depend on the conversion rates of downstream CO2 mineralization. Since\
        \ glucose inputs are a major cost driver in bio-accelerated weathering61,\
        \ kseq can help estimate lower-limit costs of scaled operations. Future scale-up\
        \ work will be necessary to formulate more accurate estimates of cost before\
        \ they can be compared with other direct CO2 mineralization technologies.\\\
        n\\n### Possibilities for downstream carbon mineralization\\n\\nOn its own,\
        \ G. oxydans bioleachate saturated with magnesium ions will be difficult to\
        \ convert into stable carbonate minerals. Due to the nature of acid leaching,\
        \ the final pH of biolixiviants post-leaching tended to be low (4\u20135)\
        \ in our experiments, making carbon mineralization chemically unfavorable.\
        \ Since pH has a significant influence on the precipitation of carbonates\
        \ due to the lower availability of carbonate ions in acidic conditions77,78,\
        \ pH adjustments are required to increase carbonate mineral yields downstream.\
        \ Increasing the concentration of gaseous CO2 injected or sparged through\
        \ the leachate increases the total dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC); however,\
        \ this reduces the pH of the leachate, reducing carbonate ion availability\
        \ and decreasing the saturation index of carbonate minerals2,77.\\n\\nA possible\
        \ downstream pathway to adjust the pH of leachates to make carbon dioxide\
        \ complexation chemically favorable is to add ammonia from biological or natural\
        \ sources to synthesize magnesite, MgCO3, or nesquehonite, MgCO3\xB73H2O.\
        \ Adding ammonia to CO2-sparged magnesium chloride solutions at ambient temperatures\
        \ was shown to completely convert free magnesium ions into nesquehonite in\
        \ about ten minutes79. Furthermore, ammonia can be recycled in this process\
        \ through recovery of ammonia using activated carbon, which has been shown\
        \ to recover ammonium chloride salts and separate them into ammonia and hydrochloric\
        \ acid at near ambient conditions80. Another possibility is to simply add\
        \ sodium hydroxide that has been electrically synthesized from carbon-neutral\
        \ pathways.\\n\\nMicrobes that accelerate carbon mineralization, such as cyanobacteria,\
        \ have been observed to accelerate mineralization in legacy alkaline mine\
        \ tailings34,35. Coupling bio-accelerated weathering from Gluconobacter oxydans\
        \ with biotic downstream processes could maximize carbonate precipitation\
        \ in a low-resource and energy-efficient process that could be genetically\
        \ engineered further.\\n\\n### Scale-Up and future steps\\n\\nIn order to\
        \ show that bio-accelerated weathering is a feasible option for gigatonne-scale\
        \ CO2 sequestration, future work will be required to show that a scaled-up\
        \ bioprocess is possible without a significant reduction in efficiency compared\
        \ to the bench-scale experiments shown here.\\n\\nBench-scale lab results\
        \ rarely have equal yields and efficiencies when scaled up to pilot- or industrial-scale\
        \ bioprocesses. Being an obligate aerobe, G. oxydans requires air exchange\
        \ and consistent mixing for optimal growth. Furthermore, optimized mixing\
        \ of the mineral substrate with biolixiviants, rate of glucose supplementation,\
        \ rate of mineral addition, and optimized particle sizes for leaching are\
        \ yet to be thoroughly investigated. To address these scale-up challenges,\
        \ all process parameters will need to be investigated in bioreactor experiments.\\\
        n\\nAnother consideration is how cell viability changes throughout the leaching\
        \ process. G. oxydans has been shown to be resilient in high metal concentrations11,\
        \ unlike several other microbes. However, having high pulp densities of dunite\
        \ would be a growth challenge for G. oxydans. Despite this, cell viability\
        \ during leaching may not be a critical parameter for the effectiveness of\
        \ leaching by G. oxydans biolixiviants. For short term leaching, it is shown\
        \ that having cells present in the biolixiviant has an insignificant effect\
        \ on leaching (Fig. 4). Since biolixiviants are produced in an independent\
        \ step before leaching begins (Figure S1), it is not essential to have live\
        \ cells present during leaching. However, possible direct microbe-mineral\
        \ interactions and continued acid production may have an effect on long-term\
        \ leaching and scaled processes.\\n\\nOvercoming the deceleration of leaching\
        \ over time is also a future scale-up challenge to address. The rates of leaching\
        \ were shown to slow down over the 96 h they were monitored (Fig. 3). As ultramafic\
        \ minerals are dissolved by biolixiviants, passivation layers can form from\
        \ amorphous silica (Note S1) or other mineral byproducts. Furthermore, as\
        \ the solution nears saturation of metal cations, dissolution rates are expected\
        \ to stagnate. Future investigations into overcoming the passivation layers\
        \ and developing integrated mineralization technologies to allow for continuous\
        \ leaching will be necessary for scale-up.\\n\\nUtilizing lignocellulosic-based\
        \ sugars as an alternative sugar feedstock also poses a challenge in scale-up.\
        \ Although G. oxydans has been shown to effectively produce biolixiviants\
        \ from cellulosic hydrolysate, the state of lignocellulosic sugar production\
        \ is underdeveloped. Large-scale production of sugars derived from second-generation\
        \ biomass (lignocellulose) is still limited, and developments in improving\
        \ efficiency and yield are ongoing. Advances in the supply chain of lignocellulosic\
        \ biomass and optimization in pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis will be\
        \ necessary in the near future for the large-scale implementation of lignocellulosic-based\
        \ sugars for bio-accelerated weathering66.\\n\\n## G. oxydans biolixiviants\
        \ accelerate magnesium and energy-critical metal leaching by 20\xD7 over deionized\
        \ water after 24 h\\n\\nBiolixiviants from wild-type Gluconobacter oxydans\
        \ effectively leached magnesium from ultramafic rocks (Fig. 2A). The efficiency\
        \ of extraction measures how much of the available metal is leached from the\
        \ mineral, and is calculated from the ratio of metal concentrations in the\
        \ leachate and the original concentration in the source multiplied by the\

        \ water is used as a control for these experiments since it estimates the\
        \ improvements made by bio-accelerated leaching to leaching from environmental\
        \ water sources, such as rainwater. In traditional accelerated carbon mineralization\
        \ with ultramafic rocks, crushed rocks are dispersed over land, where water\
        \ from the environment is the solvent for magnesium8,29,30. Comparing the\
        \ concentrations of magnesium between leaching with biolixiviants and water\
        \ provides a rough estimate for the order of magnitude in which carbon mineralization\
        \ is accelerated by G. oxydans.\\n\\nAfter 24 h of leaching with dunite at\
        \ 1% pulp density, magnesium was leached with an extraction efficiency of\
        \ 11% (300 ppm), corresponding to an increase of 20\xD7 when compared to the\
        \ deionized water control (Fig. 2A). The pH of wild-type biolixiviants was\
        \ 2.39 \xB1 0.02 across all experiments using wild-type biolixiviants. At\
        \ the start of each leaching experiment, the initial concentrations of all\
        \ metals in biolixiviants and controls are below detection limits. Figure\
        \ S3 shows how the metal concentrations in controls and G. oxydans leachates\
        \ diverge within the first few hours of leaching, starting with initial metal\
        \ concentrations of zero.Fig. 2Leaching dunite at 1% pulp density with wild-type\
        \ (WT)G. oxydans biolixiviant improves leaching of magnesium by 20-fold when\
        \ compared to leaching with deionized water (control). However, the G. oxydans\
        \ biolixiviant is only 6% better than just gluconic acid at the same pH. Bioleaching\
        \ of dunite at 1% pulp density shaking at 22 \u02DAC for 24 h was performed\
        \ with wild-type G. oxydans biolixiviant, gluconic acid diluted to the same\
        \ pH with deionized water, and a deionized water control. Panels (A) to (E)\
        \ show leaching concentrations and extraction efficiencies of Mg, Mn, Fe,\
        \ Co, and Ni. Wild-type G. oxydans biolixiviants slightly improved metal leaching\
        \ compared to gluconic acid across all metals. Stars denote significant difference\
        \ between gluconic acid leaching and wild-type biolixiviant leaching by a\
        \ Welch\u2019s two-sample t-test, where, p < 0.05 (*), p < 0.01 (**), p <\
        \ 0.001 (***).\\n\\n## Bioleaching of metals byG. oxydans increases by 73%\
        \ from 24 to 96 h\\n\\nThe most efficiently extracted metal at 24 h was Mn\
        \ (Fig. 2B), extracting over 15% of Mn from dunite (corresponding to a leachate\
        \ concentration of 1.6 ppm). Fe, Co, and Ni were also leached highly, with\
        \ efficiencies between 11% and 15% (Figs. 2C, D, and E, respectively). Al\
        \ and Cr were also leached, but much less efficiently (Figure S4). Cr was\
        \ the least efficiently extracted metal, with extraction of no more than 0.3%\
        \ under any condition (Figure S4 right column). We speculate that chromium\
        \ is significantly less leached since the chromite inclusions within dunite\
        \ are relatively more stable than olivine and resistant to acid dissolution60.\\\
        n\\nWhen leaching for longer than 24 h, bioleaching efficiency continues to\
        \ increase (Fig. 3). In a 96-hour bioleaching analysis of dunite at 1% pulp\
        \ density, bioleaching increased between 24 and 96 h by an average of 73%\
        \ for Mg, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni (Fig. 3). After 96 h, the leaching of magnesium\
        \ in biolixiviant is 42 times that of water (Fig. 3). This shows that biolixiviants\
        \ from G. oxydans improve the overall leaching of metals at a rate faster\
        \ than water.Fig. 3Increasing leaching time to 96 h increases extraction efficiency\
        \ by an average of 73% between 24 and 96 h for Mg, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni. Biolixiviants\
        \ from wild-type G. oxydans leached dunite at 1% pulp density for 96 h, shaking\
        \ at 22 \xB0C. Mg, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni concentrations were measured from leachates\
        \ every 24 h for 96 h. Error bars indicate standard deviation of measurements\
        \ from duplicate measurements.\\n\\n## TheG. oxydans biolixiviant is only\
        \ 6% better than gluconic acid at 1% pulp density\\n\\nA secondary control\
        \ was performed using only gluconic acid diluted with deionized water to the\
        \ same pH as the acid biolixiviants produced by G. oxydans. Reed et al.42\
        \ and Antonick et al.49 demonstrated that biolixiviants produced by G. oxydans\
        \ were noticeably more effective at bioleaching than gluconic acid alone.\
        \ However, recent anecdotal evidence suggests this is not the case under all\
        \ conditions. In our hands, when bioleaching ultramafic materials at low pulp\
        \ density (1%), G. oxydans-produced biolixiviants only slightly outperform\
        \ gluconic acid in leaching most metals (Fig. 2). Wild-type G. oxydans biolixiviants\
        \ leached only 6% more magnesium compared to pure gluconic acid that was diluted\
        \ with ultrapure water to the same pH after 24 h of leaching. Furthermore,\
        \ at least with low pulp density leaching, filtering cells from the biolixiviant\
        \ did not significantly affect bioleaching, at least under the conditions\
        \ of these tests (Fig. 4). This was done to assess if there was a significant\
        \ residual effect of microbial activity on leaching after biolixiviant production.\
        \ Furthermore, stoppering flasks during leaching to prevent gas exchange did\
        \ not significantly affect bioleaching (Figure S5). Later in the article,\
        \ we ask if there are conditions under which the G. oxydans biolixiviant has\

        \ 4Filtering cells from theG. oxydans biolixiviant does not notably reduce\
        \ the bioleaching of metals from dunite after 24-hour leaching. We compared\
        \ Bioleaching of 1% dunite by sugar water (col. 1), with whole cell lixiviant\
        \ (col. 2), and with a biolixiviant that was clarified by filtration with\
        \ a 0.22 \u03BCm syringe filter (col. 3). Filtered and unfiltered biolixiviants\
        \ were at identical pH, produced from duplicate colonies, and were added to\
        \ ultramafic minerals in identical conditions. Filtering biolixiviants before\
        \ bioleaching resulted in similar metal concentrations when compared to whole-cell\
        \ biolixiviants when leaching dunite. A Welch\u2019s two-sample t-test shows\
        \ that no significant difference was detected between the unfiltered and filtered\
        \ groups, with p-values ranging from 0.2 to 0.9. This indicates that based\
        \ on a 24-hour leaching study, the presence of G. oxydans does not significantly\
        \ improve or diminish the effect of the biolixiviant on leaching in short\
        \ term leaching.\\n\\n## Cellulosic hydrolysate can be used as an alternative\
        \ sugar feedstock for bioleaching\\n\\nTechno-economic analysis shows that\
        \ glucose feedstock for biolixiviant production is the biggest cost driver\
        \ in REE biomining with G. oxydans, accounting for almost half of the total\
        \ cost61. Furthermore, the sheer scale that carbon sequestration needs to\
        \ operate at, means that enormous amounts of feedstock will be required, potentially\
        \ placing a significant demand on the world\u2019s biomass supply62.\\n\\\
        nLignocellulose, found in agricultural waste, can be a renewable carbon source\
        \ for microbial growth and production once monomeric sugars are released through\
        \ acid pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis, making a glucose-rich cellulosic\
        \ hydrolysate63,64. Lignocellulosic sugars are being increasingly investigated\
        \ as a potential alternative sugar source for several applications, including\
        \ biofuels/bioethanol production and substrates for cellular production. Utilizing\
        \ lignocellulose-derived sugars could serve as a high glucose replacement\
        \ feedstock that would greatly improve the cost-efficiency of bioleaching\
        \ for carbon capture technologies65,66. G. oxydans has been shown to be able\
        \ to convert the glucose and xylose sugars in cellulosic hydrolysate into\
        \ gluconic acid and xylonic acid at extremely high efficiencies67\u201369.\
        \ Replacing pure glucose with cellulosic hydrolysate could further improve\
        \ the economic and environmental viability of bio-accelerated weathering.\\\
        n\\nG. oxydans has been shown to efficiently produce gluconic acid and xylonic\
        \ acid from lignocellulosic hydrolysate feedstocks67\u201369, making industrial-scale,\
        \ bio-accelerated carbon mineralization far more economically feasible. We\
        \ investigated if biolixiviants produced from cellulosic hydrolysate, rather\
        \ than pure glucose, could be effective at leaching dunite. The cellulosic\
        \ hydrolysate (CH) used in this study is a glucose-rich solution produced\
        \ from the enzymatic hydrolysis of concentrated corn stover (Table S3).\\\
        n\\nBiolixiviants produced from cellulosic hydrolysate were on average 28%\
        \ less effective in leaching magnesium compared to glucose-based biolixiviants\
        \ (Fig. 5). Leaching of Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni was also reduced by an average\
        \ of 52% compared to glucose-based biolixiviants (Fig. 5). Dunite was added\
        \ at 1% pulp density, and a leaching comparison between CH-based and glucose-based\
        \ lixiviants was conducted in parallel and in identical conditions. The cellulosic\
        \ hydrolysate added was diluted with deionized water so that the total sugar\
        \ concentrations were equal to the amount of glucose added for glucose-based\
        \ biolixiviants.Fig. 5Use of cellulosic hydrolysate as a biolixiviant feedstock\
        \ does not considerably reduce bioleaching efficiency. Panels (A) to (E) show\
        \ comparison of bioleaching of Mg, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni by Gluconobacter oxydans\
        \ when using glucose and cellulosic hydrolysate (CH) as as biolixiviant feedstock.\
        \ CH-based biolixiviant leaches magnesium on average at 72% the efficacy of\
        \ glucose-based biolixiviant. Leaching was performed with 1% dunite shaking\
        \ at 22 \xB0C for 24 h. Stars denote significant difference compared with\

        \ p < 0.05 (*), p < 0.01 (**), p < 0.001 (***).\\n\\nDespite a 28% average\
        \ reduction in Mg leaching, we were unable to detect a statistically meaningful\
        \ difference between glucose- and CH-based leaching of Mg using a Welch\u2019\
        s two-sample t-test. This was due to the small sample size and variability\
        \ in CH-based biolixiviant leachate measurements. Data collected for CH-based\
        \ biolixiviants resulted in greater variability than data with glucose-based\
        \ biolixiviants. ICP-MS analysis of cellulosic hydrolysate samples showed\
        \ that the CH used in this study contains trace concentrations of metals,\
        \ possibly as a result of the manufacturing process (Table S4). When calculating\
        \ the amounts of metal leached from CH-based biolixiviants, the concentrations\
        \ of metal in a cellulosic hydrolysate control study were subtracted from\
        \ the total detected to eliminate metal concentrations that were not extracted\
        \ from dunite. In low pulp density studies, the concentrations of metals in\
        \ the cellulosic hydrolysate feedstock interfered with metals leached, resulting\
        \ in higher overall error.\\n\\nCellulosic hydrolysate produced from corn\
        \ stover contains several toxins such as organic acids, furan derivatives,\
        \ and phenolic compounds that could inhibit the growth of G. oxydans and its\
        \ production of biolixiviant70. Cellulosic hydrolysate also significantly\
        \ increases viscosity, resulting in lower oxygen transfer rates that limit\
        \ the fermentation of glucose to gluconic acid68. Despite this, leaching results\
        \ show that G. oxydans can produce a biolixiviant from cellulosic hydrolysate\
        \ capable of leaching metals at concentrations significantly greater than\
        \ controls; however, further analysis and experimentation are needed to show\
        \ if CH can be a viable replacement to glucose without a significant reduction\
        \ in performance.\\n\\nAlthough cellulosic hydrolysate contains mild antibiotic\
        \ properties due to its acidity and certain toxic compounds, this could be\
        \ advantageous for the industrial scale use of it as a feedstock for biolixiviant\
        \ production. G. oxydans has high acid resistance and is capable of growing\
        \ and producing biolixiviant with cellulosic hydrolysate, while many other\
        \ microbes have low tolerance mechanisms for it. This could allow for cellulosic\
        \ hydrolysate to be used as an ultra-low-cost feedstock while also preventing\
        \ the growth of competing microbes. The toxic components of cellulosic hydrolysate\
        \ could also be a genetic engineering target for G. oxydans, where mutants\
        \ that have better resistance mechanisms can be selected for to improve biolixiviant\
        \ production.\\n\\n## G. oxydans mutant strain\u0394pstS, P112:mgdh improved\
        \ magnesium leaching by 12% over wild-type\\n\\nA preliminary study using\
        \ the mutant strain G. oxydans \u0394pstS, P112:mgdh43 shows that under identical\
        \ growth and leaching conditions, mutant strains of G. oxydans can be more\
        \ effective than wild-type in leaching magnesium and energy-critical metals\
        \ from dunite.\\n\\nA bioleaching analysis over 96 h using dunite at 1% pulp\
        \ density was conducted with biolixiviant from wild-type and mutant G. oxydans.\
        \ Bioleachate samples were taken and analyzed every 24 h up to 96 h using\
        \ ICP-MS. The strain used is G. oxydans \u0394pstS, P112:mgdh, which was engineered\
        \ to improve acid production for metal leaching43. It contains a clean deletion\
        \ of the pstS gene which is involved in phosphate signaling and transport44,\
        \ and an up-regulation with promoter P112 of the mgdh gene (Membrane-bound\
        \ Glucose DeHydrogenase) which is critical for converting glucose into gluconic\
        \ acid71. The \u0394pstS, P112:mgdh mutant was previously shown to decrease\
        \ the pH of biolixiviants compared to wild-type, and it increases the overall\
        \ leaching of REE43. The biolixiviant produced from the \u0394pstS, P112:mgdh\
        \ mutant had a pH of 2.01 \xB1 0.02 across all replicates, while the pH of\
        \ wild-type biolixiviants were 2.39 \xB1 0.02.\\n\\nThe analysis shows that\
        \ \u0394pstS, P112:mgdh mutant biolixiviant increases magnesium leaching by\
        \ an average of 12% over all samples taken between 24 and 96 h of leaching.\
        \ Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni had an average improvement in leaching of 12% using mutant\
        \ biolixiviant compared to wild-type (Fig. 6).Fig. 6Bioleaching efficiency\
        \ of magnesium increased by an average of 12% when leaching with a high performingG.\
        \ oxydans mutant. The G. oxydans mutant contains a deletion of pstS phosphate\
        \ signaling and transport gene, alongside up-regulation of the mgdh gene that\
        \ codes for the Membrane-bound Glucose DeHydrogenase (MGDH) with the P112\
        \ promoter (G. oxydans \u0394pstS, P112:mdgh). Leaching was done with dunite\
        \ at 1% pulp density shaking at 22 \xB0C over 96 h. Stars and dots denote\
        \ a statistically significant difference between wild-type G. oxydans and\

        \ where, p < 0.1 (.), p < 0.05 (*), p < 0.01 (**), p < 0.001 (***).\\n\\nThe\
        \ entire genome of G. oxydans is yet to be completely characterized, and several\
        \ other genes may exist that are critical in controlling metal leaching from\
        \ ultramafic rocks. Future work to characterize the genome of G. oxydans in\
        \ terms of its functions related to ultramafic leaching is vital to engineer\
        \ better mutant strains that can improve the performance of bio-accelerated\
        \ weathering. The \u0394pstS, P112:mgdh mutant is engineered to maximize gluconic\
        \ acid production; however, studies have shown that for rare earths leaching,\
        \ G. oxydans mutants can be screened to identify genes that specifically affect\
        \ rare earth extraction50. Our research group has created a quality-controlled\
        \ (QC) whole genome knockout collection for G. oxydans B58, containing a collection\
        \ of 2,733 transposon disruption mutants, each with a different nonessential\
        \ gene disrupted. This QC collection enables a high-throughput screen of the\
        \ G. oxydans genome, selecting for significant changes to dunite leaching\
        \ efficacy. This will provide us with a roadmap for genetically engineering\
        \ G. oxydans for greater ultramafic bio-accelerated weathering capability.\\\

        \ at 60% pulp density\\n\\nAt higher pulp densities and longer leaching times,\
        \ Gluconobacter oxydans biolixiviants significantly outperformed gluconic\
        \ acid at the same pH. We compared Gluconobacter oxydans biolixiviants and\
        \ gluconic acid metal leaching with 5%, 10%, and 60% dunite pulp density,\
        \ where leachate metal concentrations were measured every 24 h for 72 h. The\
        \ gluconic acid was diluted with ultrapure deionized water to match the pH\
        \ of biolixiviants, and leaching was performed in identical conditions with\
        \ the same mineral substrates (DUN-2). After 72 h of leaching, wild-type biolixiviants\
        \ leached 1.74 times more magnesium than gluconic acid from 5% dunite, 2.87\
        \ times more from 10% dunite, and 3.25 times more from 60% dunite (Fig. 7).\
        \ At higher pulp densities, Gluconobacter oxydans biolixiviants exhibit significantly\
        \ higher leaching efficiency than gluconic acid. This analysis suggests that\
        \ metal leaching from dunite is not only controlled by acidolysis, but might\
        \ contain other biologically-synthesized components that amplify extraction50.Fig.\
        \ 7At 60% pulp density, the wild-typeG. oxydans biolixiviant was 3.2\xD7 more\
        \ effective at bioleaching dunite than gluconic acid diluted to the same pH\
        \ with pure water. A comparative bioleaching study was conducted comparing\
        \ the leaching efficacy of wild-type G. oxydans biolixiviants and just gluconic\
        \ acid at the same pH. Magnesium concentrations in leachate were measured\
        \ after 24, 48, and 72 h of leaching with 5% (A), 10% (B), and 60% (C) dunite\
        \ (DUN-2). At higher dunite pulp densities, the improvement of Gluconobacter\
        \ oxydans biolixiviants compared to gluconic acid was amplified. After 72\
        \ h, biolixiviants were 74% better than gluconic acid at leaching 5% dunite,\
        \ 1.87 times better at leaching 10% dunite, and 2.25 times better at leaching\
        \ 60% dunite. Stars denote significant difference between gluconic acid leaching\

        \ After 96 h of leaching, the magnesium concentration increased by 81% when\

        \ an average of 147% (Fig. 8). Increasing the pulp density of dunite also\
        \ reduces kseq. When compared to 1% pulp density of dunite, increasing to\
        \ 10% pulp density resulted in a 5-fold increase in magnesium leaching after\

        \ Attempt #13) was a 2-step dunite addition, where 30% dunite was added on\
        \ day 0 and another 30% added on day 10, and the third method (Leaching Attempt\
        \ #14) was a 2-step dunite addition where the first 30% dunite feed was removed\
        \ from the leachate before the second 30% addition on day 10. All three leaching\
        \ methods resulted in a kseq equal to or less than 1.0, with the lowest kseq\
        \ being 0.96 on Leaching Attempt #13 in Fig. 8.Fig. 8Process and genetic improvements\
        \ reduce the amount of feedstock carbon needed to potentially sequester one\
        \ CO2 molecule from 525 to 1. Increasing leaching time, pulp density, and\
        \ reducing average particle sizes were able to reduce kseq (glucose carbon\
        \ investment vs. carbon sequestration ratio) by several orders of magnitude.\
        \ Increasing dunite pulp density from 1\u201310% had a larger impact in reducing\
        \ kseq than increasing leaching time from 1 to 10 days. Combining the \u0394\
        pstS, P112:mdgh double mutant with high pulp densities and long leaching times\
        \ resulted in a kseq value of 1 in three experiments (Col. 10\u201312). Leaching\
        \ attempts #1\u20139 used DUN-1 and attempts #10\u201312 used DUN-3 with a\
        \ particle size of less than 74 microns as the leaching substrate.\\n\\nWhat\
        \ implications do these results have for CO2 sequestration? For kseq = 525,\
        \ when using glucose as a feedstock, the cost of sequestering 1 tonne of CO2\
        \ is $358,000, a long way above the US Department of Energy\u2019s (DOE) target\
        \ of $100 per tonne72, and well above existing technologies31. On the other\
        \ hand, if we could reduce kseq to 1 (as in Fig. 8) at industrial scale, the\
        \ cost of carbon sequestration (at least the microbial feedstock part of the\
        \ cost) through bio-accelerated weathering starts to become comparable to\
        \ (still high) current technologies, at $682 per tonne31. If we could reduce\
        \ kseq to 0.15 (about a 6-fold reduction over our best attempt, much smaller\
        \ than the reduction we achieved in the course of writing this article) then\
        \ we could reduce the feedstock cost for sequestering 1 tonne of CO2 to $100.\
        \ This would not account for the costs of mining ultramafic material, but\
        \ nor does it account for the offset cost of energy-critical metal recovery.\
        \ However, using this to sequester 20 gigatonnes of CO2 a year5 would require\
        \ 2 billion tonnes of glucose, over 10 times current global annual sugar production73.\\\
        n\\nSugars derived from cellulosic biomass are potentially much more abundant\
        \ than glucose that is derived from cereal crops like corn, sugar cane, and\
        \ sugar beet74. While there is no widespread production of cellulosic sugars\
        \ today that is not immediately diverted to cellulosic ethanol production,\
        \ this could happen in the future. Furthermore, it is estimated that cellulosic\
        \ sugar production could be as low as $100 per tonne75 (in contrast to around\
        \ $1,000 per tonne for glucose). Although cellulosic sugars are abundant,\
        \ they are not limitless. Slade et al.76, made estimates of global bioenergy\
        \ supply, and concluded that several tipping points would occur as the amount\
        \ of biomass withdrawn from the biosphere for bioenergy (or some other chemical\
        \ production, such as carbon sequestration) increased, forcing increasingly\
        \ unpalatable choices on global society including mass adoption of vegetarian\
        \ diets, mass deforestation, population control, or combinations thereof.\
        \ Their analysis suggests that the first global agricultural tipping point\
        \ (choosing one of the three unpalatable options) would occur when biomass\
        \ was withdrawn at a rate of around 7 gigatonnes per year62. Assuming that\
        \ cellulosic sugars are on average a 50:50 mix of C5 and C6 sugars, then to\
        \ reduce the cellulosic biomass demand to sequester 20 gigatonnes of CO2 to\
        \ 3.5 gigatonnes, kseq needs only to be reduced to 0.25.\\n\\nAlthough kseq\
        \ serves as a useful metric for displaying sugar investment in terms of CO2\
        \ sequestration potential, it is only a theoretical value whose real value\
        \ will depend on the conversion rates of downstream CO2 mineralization. Since\
        \ glucose inputs are a major cost driver in bio-accelerated weathering61,\
        \ kseq can help estimate lower-limit costs of scaled operations. Future scale-up\
        \ work will be necessary to formulate more accurate estimates of cost before\
        \ they can be compared with other direct CO2 mineralization technologies.\\\
        n\\n## Possibilities for downstream carbon mineralization\\n\\nOn its own,\
        \ G. oxydans bioleachate saturated with magnesium ions will be difficult to\
        \ convert into stable carbonate minerals. Due to the nature of acid leaching,\
        \ the final pH of biolixiviants post-leaching tended to be low (4\u20135)\
        \ in our experiments, making carbon mineralization chemically unfavorable.\
        \ Since pH has a significant influence on the precipitation of carbonates\
        \ due to the lower availability of carbonate ions in acidic conditions77,78,\
        \ pH adjustments are required to increase carbonate mineral yields downstream.\
        \ Increasing the concentration of gaseous CO2 injected or sparged through\
        \ the leachate increases the total dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC); however,\
        \ this reduces the pH of the leachate, reducing carbonate ion availability\
        \ and decreasing the saturation index of carbonate minerals2,77.\\n\\nA possible\
        \ downstream pathway to adjust the pH of leachates to make carbon dioxide\
        \ complexation chemically favorable is to add ammonia from biological or natural\
        \ sources to synthesize magnesite, MgCO3, or nesquehonite, MgCO3\xB73H2O.\
        \ Adding ammonia to CO2-sparged magnesium chloride solutions at ambient temperatures\
        \ was shown to completely convert free magnesium ions into nesquehonite in\
        \ about ten minutes79. Furthermore, ammonia can be recycled in this process\
        \ through recovery of ammonia using activated carbon, which has been shown\
        \ to recover ammonium chloride salts and separate them into ammonia and hydrochloric\
        \ acid at near ambient conditions80. Another possibility is to simply add\
        \ sodium hydroxide that has been electrically synthesized from carbon-neutral\
        \ pathways.\\n\\nMicrobes that accelerate carbon mineralization, such as cyanobacteria,\
        \ have been observed to accelerate mineralization in legacy alkaline mine\
        \ tailings34,35. Coupling bio-accelerated weathering from Gluconobacter oxydans\
        \ with biotic downstream processes could maximize carbonate precipitation\
        \ in a low-resource and energy-efficient process that could be genetically\
        \ engineered further.\\n\\n## Scale-Up and future steps\\n\\nIn order to show\
        \ that bio-accelerated weathering is a feasible option for gigatonne-scale\
        \ CO2 sequestration, future work will be required to show that a scaled-up\
        \ bioprocess is possible without a significant reduction in efficiency compared\
        \ to the bench-scale experiments shown here.\\n\\nBench-scale lab results\
        \ rarely have equal yields and efficiencies when scaled up to pilot- or industrial-scale\
        \ bioprocesses. Being an obligate aerobe, G. oxydans requires air exchange\
        \ and consistent mixing for optimal growth. Furthermore, optimized mixing\
        \ of the mineral substrate with biolixiviants, rate of glucose supplementation,\
        \ rate of mineral addition, and optimized particle sizes for leaching are\
        \ yet to be thoroughly investigated. To address these scale-up challenges,\
        \ all process parameters will need to be investigated in bioreactor experiments.\\\
        n\\nAnother consideration is how cell viability changes throughout the leaching\
        \ process. G. oxydans has been shown to be resilient in high metal concentrations11,\
        \ unlike several other microbes. However, having high pulp densities of dunite\
        \ would be a growth challenge for G. oxydans. Despite this, cell viability\
        \ during leaching may not be a critical parameter for the effectiveness of\
        \ leaching by G. oxydans biolixiviants. For short term leaching, it is shown\
        \ that having cells present in the biolixiviant has an insignificant effect\
        \ on leaching (Fig. 4). Since biolixiviants are produced in an independent\
        \ step before leaching begins (Figure S1), it is not essential to have live\
        \ cells present during leaching. However, possible direct microbe-mineral\
        \ interactions and continued acid production may have an effect on long-term\
        \ leaching and scaled processes.\\n\\nOvercoming the deceleration of leaching\
        \ over time is also a future scale-up challenge to address. The rates of leaching\
        \ were shown to slow down over the 96 h they were monitored (Fig. 3). As ultramafic\
        \ minerals are dissolved by biolixiviants, passivation layers can form from\
        \ amorphous silica (Note S1) or other mineral byproducts. Furthermore, as\
        \ the solution nears saturation of metal cations, dissolution rates are expected\
        \ to stagnate. Future investigations into overcoming the passivation layers\
        \ and developing integrated mineralization technologies to allow for continuous\
        \ leaching will be necessary for scale-up.\\n\\nUtilizing lignocellulosic-based\
        \ sugars as an alternative sugar feedstock also poses a challenge in scale-up.\
        \ Although G. oxydans has been shown to effectively produce biolixiviants\
        \ from cellulosic hydrolysate, the state of lignocellulosic sugar production\
        \ is underdeveloped. Large-scale production of sugars derived from second-generation\
        \ biomass (lignocellulose) is still limited, and developments in improving\
        \ efficiency and yield are ongoing. Advances in the supply chain of lignocellulosic\
        \ biomass and optimization in pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis will be\
        \ necessary in the near future for the large-scale implementation of lignocellulosic-based\
        \ sugars for bio-accelerated weathering66.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nThis article\
        \ shows that G. oxydans possesses the capability to bioleach metals for energy\
        \ technologies and carbon mineralization from dunite. At low pulp densities\
        \ (1%), the G. oxydans organic acid-based biolixiviant is 20\xD7 more effective\
        \ at Mg leaching than deionized water. At high pulp densities (60%), the biolixiviant\
        \ is 3.2\xD7 better than even gluconic acid alone. This suggests that microbially-accelerated\
        \ weathering of ultramafic materials could be an environmentally-friendly\
        \ method for supplying Mg for mineralization of CO2, and metals like Ni and\
        \ Co for sustainable energy technologies at rates that can far exceed equivalent\
        \ abiotic methods.\\n\\nSeveral pH swing methods have been shown to be highly\
        \ effective for greatly accelerating olivine carbonation7,81. However, scaling\
        \ up these technologies to meet the world\u2019s CO2 removal requirements\
        \ may involve high energy costs82 and environmental drawbacks like those found\
        \ in strong acid leaching involved with large scale energy-critical metal\
        \ mining. Other methods of accelerated weathering involving energy-intensive\
        \ preprocessing of mineral feedstocks by crushing, grinding, and chemically\
        \ treating ultramafic rocks also come with their own environmental and scaling\
        \ drawbacks. In situ accelerated ultramafic weathering can result in environmental\
        \ leaching and environmental drainage of harmful doses of nickel, chromium,\
        \ and cobalt59,83\u201385. These methods also involve slow kinetics that depend\
        \ on high energy inputs to be accelerated and enormous land use7,28,82,86.\\\
        n\\nBio-accelerated weathering may be an alternative approach to mineral weathering\
        \ for carbon mineralization. When engineered further, this strategy may prove\
        \ an economically-viable and scalable option that avoids the environmental\
        \ concerns with in situ mechanically-accelerated weathering and strong acid\
        \ leaching51,59,84,85,87, as well as the energy costs involved in high temperature\
        \ and pressure reactions14,82. Energy requirements for heating in common abiotic\
        \ carbonation processes, such as ammonium salts-driven pH swings and HCl pH\
        \ swings, often result in CO2 emissions greater than the amount sequestered82.\
        \ G. oxydans-based bioleaching was shown to be effective at ambient temperature\
        \ and pressure, removing a major energy burden for this process.\\n\\nIn this\
        \ article, we were able to reduce the number of carbon atoms in glucose needed\
        \ to sequester one molecule of CO2 from 525 to 1. However, further work needs\
        \ to be done to optimize G. oxydans for enhanced weathering for carbon mineralization.\
        \ Maximizing the leaching of magnesium while minimizing carbon inputs and\
        \ lowering the economic costs are key steps to making this technology viable\
        \ for eliminating the several gigatonnes of carbon dioxide in excess on our\
        \ planet.\\n\\n## Materials and methods\\n\\nUltramafic samples were collected\
        \ from the Day Brook Dunite (35\u02DA 58\u2019 0.45\u201D N, 82\u02DA 16\u2019\
        \ 58.60\u201D W) in western North Carolina88. The chemically weathered exterior\
        \ of the dunite was removed using a tile saw (151991, MK Diamond Products,\
        \ Inc., Torrance, CA). The trimmed interior was crushed into powder using\
        \ a SPEX SamplePrep 8000M mill and a tungsten carbide vial. Before bioleaching\
        \ experiments, the mineralogy of powder from two samples was analyzed via\
        \ x-ray diffraction (XRD) with a Bruker D8 Advance ECO powder diffractometer\
        \ at Cornell Center for Materials Research (CCMR). The instrument is equipped\
        \ with a Copper K-\u03B1 X-ray source. Analyses were made at 5 to 60 degrees,\
        \ with an increment of 0.019 degrees and a dwell time of 0.3 seconds per step.\
        \ To mitigate Fe fluorescence the detector\u2019s lower discriminator was\
        \ raised from 0.110 V to 0.182 V. XRD shows that sample DUN-1 consists of\
        \ 64 wt. % olivine, 27 wt. % lizardite, 5 wt. % antigorite, and 4 wt. % talc.\
        \ Sample DUN-2 contains 37 wt. % olivine, 59 wt. % lizardite, 2 wt. % talc,\
        \ and 2 wt. % meixnerite. Sample DUN-3 contains 92 wt. % olivine, 5 wt. %\
        \ antigorite, 2 wt. % lizardite, and 1 wt. % talc. Major and trace element\
        \ compositions of the bulk rock were determined at the Hamilton Analytical\
        \ Laboratory in Clinton, NY via XRF and LA-ICPMS and are shown in Tables S1\
        \ and S2.\\n\\nThree separate dunite samples were used in bioleaching studies.\
        \ DUN-1 was used in the leaching studies shown in Figures 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and\
        \ Supplementary Figures S4 and S5. Due to the depletion of DUN-1 in previous\
        \ experiments, DUN-2 was used to produce the data used in Figure 7. DUN-3\
        \ was used in Leaching Attempts #10 and #12-14 in Figure 8 and Supplementary\
        \ Figure S3.\\n\\n### Microorganisms and media\\n\\nGluconobacter oxydans\
        \ strain NRRL B-58 (GoB58) was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection\
        \ (ATTC), Manassas, VA. In all experiments, GoB58 was cultured in Yeast-Peptone-Mannitol\
        \ media (YPM; 5 g L-1 yeast extract (C7341, Hardy Diagnostics, Santa Maria,\
        \ CA), 3 g L-1 peptone (211677, BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ), 25 g L-1 mannitol\

        \ then incubated for 24 h at 30 \xB0C and 200 rpm in a shaking incubator (Infors\
        \ HT Multitron). Cultures were then back-diluted to OD590 of 0.05 in a total\
        \ volume of 25 mL YPM in 50 mL flasks. The flasks were then incubated at 30\
        \ \xB0C and 200 rpm until the OD590 reaches approximately 1.5 after about\
        \ 48 h. Cultures were then split into 7.5 mL triplicates with 7.5 mL of 40%\
        \ glucose added to each triplicate, for a total volume of 15 mL. The glucose\
        \ and bacterial mixture was then incubated for 48 h at 30 \xB0C and 200 rpm,\
        \ starting biolixiviant production. After 48 h, the pH of each flask is measured\
        \ (VWR Symphony B10P.).\\n\\nCellulosic hydrolysate (National Renewable Energy\
        \ Laboratory, Golden, CO) was used in some leaching studies as an alternative\
        \ glucose feedstock. In experiments using cellulosic hydrolysate, it was diluted\
        \ to 80% concentration so that the total sugar concentrations (Table S2) would\
        \ be equal to 40%. Then 7.5 mL of 80% cellulosic hydrolysate was added in\
        \ replacement of 7.5 mL of 40% glucose.\\n\\n### Bioleaching studies\\n\\\
        nBioleaching experiments were conducted with dunite at a pulp density of 1\u2013\
        10% wt/vol, as specified. Minerals were added to 15 mL of biolixiviant, then\
        \ agitated at room temperature in a shaking incubator for 24 h. After 24 h,\
        \ the ultramafic rock and biolixiviant slurry was centrifuged and the bioleachate\
        \ was extracted for ICP-MS analysis.\\n\\n### Analytical methods\\n\\nLeachates\

        \ Advance 96-well filter plate (8029, Pall Corporation, Show Low, AZ, USA)\
        \ by centrifugation at 1,500 \xD7 g for 5 min, then diluted to 1% with 2%\
        \ trace metal grade nitric acid (JT9368, J.T. Baker, Radnor, Pennsylvania,\
        \ USA). Samples were analyzed with an Agilent 7800 ICP-MS. The concentrations\
        \ of metals were measured against a custom ICP-MS standard solution containing\
        \ 10 mg/L of Al, As, B, Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Mo, Na, Ni, P,\
        \ Pb, S, Sb, Se, Si, Sn, and Zn (High Purity Standards, North Charleston,\
        \ SC) and an ICP-MS internal standard (5188\u20136525, Agilent Technologies,\
        \ Santa Clara, CA). Quality checks were done with intermittent standards and\
        \ blanks as specified in the ICP-MS guidelines and protocols89.\\n\\n### Limitations\
        \ of the study\\n\\nThis study was designed to establish a baseline understanding\
        \ of ultramafic rock leaching by G. oxydans. The starting ultramafic rocks\
        \ were chosen due to their high olivine/forsterite content and low complexity\
        \ (lower content of other minerals). More industrially-applicable and abundant\
        \ starting materials, such as lower olivine-containing forms of dunite, ultramafic\
        \ mine tailings, and highly serpentinized ultramafic rocks will be investigated\
        \ in future studies.\\n\\nThis study only observes G. oxydans leaching over\
        \ short periods at relatively low pulp densities. While some experiments did\
        \ include high pulp densities for long periods (Fig. 8), a rigorous examination\
        \ of how leaching evolves over long periods was not conducted. Future experimentation\
        \ and cost analysis is necessary to determine optimal mineral pulp densities\
        \ and leaching times.\\n\\nThis study focuses on the extracted metal content\
        \ found in solution during leaching. A complete mass balance that monitors\
        \ the starting and ending mineral substrates will be addressed in future studies.\
        \ Future studies will also include surface area measurements of starting and\
        \ post-leaching mineral substrates.\\n\\n### Statistics\\n\\nA Welch\u2019\
        s two-sample t-test was performed to determine statistical significance in\
        \ comparative bioleaching studies. A Welch\u2019s two-sample t-test was done\
        \ since some studies, such as a comparison of sugar feedstocks (Fig. 5), resulted\
        \ in differences in variances between the two groups tested. The Welch\u2019\
        s t-test is more appropriate in instances when the variances between two groups\
        \ cannot be considered as equal. Significance was displayed in all figures\

        \ rock and biolixiviant slurry was centrifuged and the bioleachate was extracted\
        \ for ICP-MS analysis.\\n\\n## Analytical methods\\n\\nLeachates from bioleaching\
        \ experiments were filtered through a 0.45 \u03BCm AcroPrep Advance 96-well\
        \ filter plate (8029, Pall Corporation, Show Low, AZ, USA) by centrifugation\
        \ at 1,500 \xD7 g for 5 min, then diluted to 1% with 2% trace metal grade\
        \ nitric acid (JT9368, J.T. Baker, Radnor, Pennsylvania, USA). Samples were\
        \ analyzed with an Agilent 7800 ICP-MS. The concentrations of metals were\
        \ measured against a custom ICP-MS standard solution containing 10 mg/L of\
        \ Al, As, B, Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Mo, Na, Ni, P, Pb, S, Sb,\
        \ Se, Si, Sn, and Zn (High Purity Standards, North Charleston, SC) and an\
        \ ICP-MS internal standard (5188\u20136525, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara,\
        \ CA). Quality checks were done with intermittent standards and blanks as\
        \ specified in the ICP-MS guidelines and protocols89.\\n\\n## Limitations\
        \ of the study\\n\\nThis study was designed to establish a baseline understanding\
        \ of ultramafic rock leaching by G. oxydans. The starting ultramafic rocks\
        \ were chosen due to their high olivine/forsterite content and low complexity\
        \ (lower content of other minerals). More industrially-applicable and abundant\
        \ starting materials, such as lower olivine-containing forms of dunite, ultramafic\
        \ mine tailings, and highly serpentinized ultramafic rocks will be investigated\
        \ in future studies.\\n\\nThis study only observes G. oxydans leaching over\
        \ short periods at relatively low pulp densities. While some experiments did\
        \ include high pulp densities for long periods (Fig. 8), a rigorous examination\
        \ of how leaching evolves over long periods was not conducted. Future experimentation\
        \ and cost analysis is necessary to determine optimal mineral pulp densities\
        \ and leaching times.\\n\\nThis study focuses on the extracted metal content\
        \ found in solution during leaching. A complete mass balance that monitors\
        \ the starting and ending mineral substrates will be addressed in future studies.\
        \ Future studies will also include surface area measurements of starting and\
        \ post-leaching mineral substrates.\\n\\n## Statistics\\n\\nA Welch\u2019\
        s two-sample t-test was performed to determine statistical significance in\
        \ comparative bioleaching studies. A Welch\u2019s two-sample t-test was done\
        \ since some studies, such as a comparison of sugar feedstocks (Fig. 5), resulted\
        \ in differences in variances between the two groups tested. The Welch\u2019\
        s t-test is more appropriate in instances when the variances between two groups\
        \ cannot be considered as equal. Significance was displayed in all figures\
        \ as dots and stars, where p < 0.1 (.), p < 0.05 (*), p < 0.01 (**), p < 0.001\

        \ is no industrially useful process for dissolving ultramafic materials to\
        \ release cations for CO2 sequestration or mining them for energy-critical\
        \ elements. Weathering of ultramafic rocks by rainwater, release of metal\

        :\"IntroductionThe accumulation of over a trillion tonnes of anthropogenic\
        \ CO2 in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere1\u20134 driving global climate change\
        \ is one of the most pressing challenges of our time. To address this, the\
        \ IPCC\u2019s Special Report in 2018 stresses the necessity of deploying carbon\
        \ dioxide removal (CDR) technology capable of removing tens of gigatonnes\
        \ of CO2 from the atmosphere annually, paired with carbon-neutral energy technologies\
        \ to prevent global warming from exceeding 1.5\u02DAC above pre-industrial\
        \ levels5.Mineralization of CO2 is a highly attractive approach for permanent\
        \ sequestration of CO2, as it converts atmospheric carbon into solid minerals\
        \ as a permanent sink6,7. Carbon mineralization proceeds through a two-step\
        \ process. First, ultramafic rocks are dissolved by weathering to release\
        \ magnesium cations (Note S1). In the second step, magnesium ions are reacted\
        \ with dissolved carbonate to form magnesite (MgCO3), a stable mineral that\
        \ permanently stores CO28 (Note S1). A schematic of a proposed indirect carbonation\
        \ method is shown in Fig. 1.Fig. 1Proposed system for bio-accelerated weathering\
        \ of ultramafic materials for carbon mineralization. This work focuses on\
        \ the rate-limiting step, the metal leaching stage (enclosed in red box),\
        \ where G. oxydans biolixiviant leaches magnesium ions and other metals from\
        \ dunite. Downstream carbonation results in magnesite formation for CO2 storage,\
        \ and metal recovery done chemically or electrochemically can extract energy-critical\
        \ metals for commercial use.Naturally occurring weathering of ultramafic rocks\
        \ and subsequent carbon mineralization is thought to be responsible for removal\
        \ of up to hundreds of millions of tonnes of CO2 each year8\u201311. In fact,\
        \ because ultramafic rocks are so abundant12,13, reaction of all of the metal\
        \ cations in all surface-accessible ultramafic material could capture 100\
        \ trillion tonnes of CO2 as carbonate minerals14 (at least 58\xD7 the excess\
        \ CO2 in the atmosphere), making them a strong candidate for gigatonne-scale\
        \ CDR15,8,16. However, natural carbon mineralization is partially offset by\
        \ oxidation of rock organic carbon11,17. As a result, the time to naturally\
        \ regulate atmospheric CO2 levels is estimated to be between tens and hundreds\
        \ of thousands of years8,11,18\u201320.The large-scale deployment of carbon-neutral\
        \ energy technologies will also be necessary to control climate change5, but\
        \ it will require vast quantities of metals21. In addition to metal cations\
        \ needed for CO2 sequestration, ultramafic minerals are a potential low-grade\
        \ ore source for energy-critical metals such as nickel (batteries and stainless\
        \ steel), chromium (concentrated solar and geothermal energy), manganese (steel\
        \ and batteries), cobalt (batteries), and copper (wiring and wind turbines)8,21\u2013\
        25 (Figure S2, Tables S1 and S2). This presents an opportunity to extract\
        \ energy-critical metals from ultramafic rock while sequestering CO2.However,\
        \ extracting metals from ultramafic rocks poses a significant challenge. In\
        \ aqueous mineral carbonation, the rate of carbon mineralization is limited\
        \ by the slow kinetics of the leaching of metal ions from ultramafic sources14,26,27.\
        \ While mechanical acceleration of ultramafic weathering through crushing,\
        \ grinding, heating, chemically treating, and spreading over land is promising\
        \ for its high sequestration potential and improved kinetics8,16,28\u2013\
        30, it requires large area footprints and high energy inputs involved in crushing,\
        \ grinding, heating, and pressurizing, making it prohibitively expensive31.\
        \ Likewise, technologies to extract the energy-critical elements present in\
        \ low concentration in ultramafic rocks present formidable economic and environmental\
        \ challenges24,32,33.We hypothesize that microbially-accelerated mineral dissolution\
        \ could overcome the slow kinetics and high costs14 of the dissolution of\
        \ ultramafic material, releasing magnesium ions at a rate several orders of\
        \ magnitude greater than in nature34,35. Over the past two decades, microbial\
        \ mineral dissolution has revolutionized mining copper and gold from low-grade\
        \ ores\u2014a process known as biomining. Bacteria such as Acidithiobacillus\
        \ ferrooxidans and related species are responsible for producing about 15%\
        \ of the world\u2019s copper supply and about 5% of its gold supply36 through\
        \ iron-redox-mediated bioleaching, a process in which microbes alter the redox\
        \ state of metals to extract them from mineral substrates37,38. Significant\
        \ research has been performed to improve industrial-scale Cu bioleaching with\
        \ consortia including A. ferrooxidans and non-domesticated microbes, resulting\
        \ in processes that are fairly mature. While copper biomining is the only\
        \ industrialized biomining process, organisms and processes are in development\
        \ for rare earth elements (REE)39\u201344 and lithium45,46.Biolixiviants produced\
        \ by Gluconobacter oxydans are a strong candidate for a sustainable and strong\
        \ catalyst for CO2 mineralization using ultramafic rocks11,47. A recent study\
        \ from our team comparing the dunite dissolution performance of three mineral-dissolving\
        \ microbes, Gluconobacter oxydans, Sphingomonas desiccabilis, and Penicillium\
        \ simplicissimum, concludes that G. oxydans outperformed the other two in\
        \ the extraction of all metals from dunite11.G. oxydans efficiently produces\
        \ a gluconic acid-based mineral-dissolving solution, called a biolixiviant,\
        \ when glucose is present47,48. Previous studies have shown that biolixiviants\
        \ from G. oxydans can be more effective than just gluconic acid at leaching\
        \ REE42,49. In a recent article, our team identified genes that control the\
        \ effectiveness of the G. oxydans biolixiviant at dissolving neodymium phosphate\
        \ (synthetic monazite) but do not notably change its pH50. These results suggest\
        \ that biologically-produced lixiviants could contain additional components,\
        \ such as metal chelators, redox molecules, and flavins that improve overall\
        \ metal leaching at fixed pH, allowing for more efficient and low-resource\
        \ metal leaching. This could avoid the use of strong acids that can have harmful\
        \ environmental effects such as acid mine drainage51.Second, it is suspected\
        \ that microbes interact with ultramafic materials in the wild, accelerating\
        \ weathering processes52\u201355. Furthermore, laboratory mixed cultures have\
        \ been shown to dissolve ultramafic material56. Meanwhile, in two companion\
        \ articles, we demonstrate that three easily culturable isolated species (G.\
        \ oxydans, Penicillium simplicissimum and Sphingomonas desiccabilis) can all\
        \ accelerate the dissolution of ultramafic material11 and characterize mineral\
        \ phase transformations due to bioleaching by G. oxydans57.However, there\
        \ has been little systematic study of microbial dissolution of ultramafic\
        \ minerals. Furthermore, it remains unclear under what conditions a biolixiviant\
        \ could be more effective than just an organic acid and why; could genetic\
        \ engineering improve ultramafic bioleaching; what impact process parameters\
        \ have on biological dissolution of ultramafic materials; the extraction efficiencies\
        \ for energy critical elements; utilization of low-cost feedstock; and the\
        \ carbon source demand of large-scale ultramafic bioleaching. To address these\
        \ knowledge gaps, we provide some of the first systematic observations of\
        \ dissolution of ultramafic minerals by the mineral-dissolving microbe, G.\
        \ oxydans B58.\",\"results\":\"Results and discussionIn this work, we perform\
        \ a study of G. oxydans bioleaching capability on dunite, an ultramafic rock\
        \ composed of greater than 90% olivine (see composition in Figure S2, and\
        \ Tables S1 and S2). For accelerated weathering technologies, olivine-rich\
        \ dunite is the preferred feedstock due to olivine having the highest CO2\
        \ sequestration potential by mass, excellent carbonation kinetics, and high\
        \ abundance58,59.This study benchmarks the bioleaching efficacy of glucose-based\
        \ and lignocellulosic sugar-based biolixiviants produced by G. oxydans on\
        \ dunite, comparing conditions of whole-cell and filtered (cell-free) biolixiviants,\
        \ varying pulp densities, aerobic and anaerobic conditions, and short-term\
        \ and long-term leaching. This study also investigates how a high-performing\
        \ mutant strain of G. oxydans could improve leaching in ultramafic minerals,\
        \ serving as a preliminary study of how genetic engineering could further\
        \ improve bioleaching for carbon mineralization. We demonstrate that the effectiveness\
        \ advantage of the G. oxydans biolixiviant over gluconic acid alone grows\
        \ with increasing pulp density. Finally, we demonstrate that the number of\
        \ carbon atoms that need to be supplied by sugar feedstocks can be reduced\
        \ to match the number of carbon atoms potentially sequestered as a mineral.G.\

        \ is used as a control for these experiments since it estimates the improvements\
        \ made by bio-accelerated leaching to leaching from environmental water sources,\
        \ such as rainwater. In traditional accelerated carbon mineralization with\
        \ ultramafic rocks, crushed rocks are dispersed over land, where water from\
        \ the environment is the solvent for magnesium8,29,30. Comparing the concentrations\
        \ of magnesium between leaching with biolixiviants and water provides a rough\
        \ estimate for the order of magnitude in which carbon mineralization is accelerated\
        \ by G. oxydans.After 24 h of leaching with dunite at 1% pulp density, magnesium\
        \ was leached with an extraction efficiency of 11% (300 ppm), corresponding\
        \ to an increase of 20\xD7 when compared to the deionized water control (Fig.\
        \ 2A). The pH of wild-type biolixiviants was 2.39 \xB1 0.02 across all experiments\
        \ using wild-type biolixiviants. At the start of each leaching experiment,\
        \ the initial concentrations of all metals in biolixiviants and controls are\
        \ below detection limits. Figure S3 shows how the metal concentrations in\
        \ controls and G. oxydans leachates diverge within the first few hours of\
        \ leaching, starting with initial metal concentrations of zero.Fig. 2Leaching\
        \ dunite at 1% pulp density with wild-type (WT)G. oxydans biolixiviant improves\
        \ leaching of magnesium by 20-fold when compared to leaching with deionized\
        \ water (control). However, the G. oxydans biolixiviant is only 6% better\
        \ than just gluconic acid at the same pH. Bioleaching of dunite at 1% pulp\
        \ density shaking at 22 \u02DAC for 24 h was performed with wild-type G. oxydans\
        \ biolixiviant, gluconic acid diluted to the same pH with deionized water,\
        \ and a deionized water control. Panels (A) to (E) show leaching concentrations\
        \ and extraction efficiencies of Mg, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni. Wild-type G. oxydans\
        \ biolixiviants slightly improved metal leaching compared to gluconic acid\
        \ across all metals. Stars denote significant difference between gluconic\
        \ acid leaching and wild-type biolixiviant leaching by a Welch\u2019s two-sample\
        \ t-test, where, p < 0.05 (*), p < 0.01 (**), p < 0.001 (***).Bioleaching\
        \ of metals byG. oxydans increases by 73% from 24 to 96 hThe most efficiently\
        \ extracted metal at 24 h was Mn (Fig. 2B), extracting over 15% of Mn from\
        \ dunite (corresponding to a leachate concentration of 1.6 ppm). Fe, Co, and\
        \ Ni were also leached highly, with efficiencies between 11% and 15% (Figs.\
        \ 2C, D, and E, respectively). Al and Cr were also leached, but much less\
        \ efficiently (Figure S4). Cr was the least efficiently extracted metal, with\
        \ extraction of no more than 0.3% under any condition (Figure S4 right column).\
        \ We speculate that chromium is significantly less leached since the chromite\
        \ inclusions within dunite are relatively more stable than olivine and resistant\
        \ to acid dissolution60.When leaching for longer than 24 h, bioleaching efficiency\
        \ continues to increase (Fig. 3). In a 96-hour bioleaching analysis of dunite\
        \ at 1% pulp density, bioleaching increased between 24 and 96 h by an average\
        \ of 73% for Mg, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni (Fig. 3). After 96 h, the leaching of\
        \ magnesium in biolixiviant is 42 times that of water (Fig. 3). This shows\
        \ that biolixiviants from G. oxydans improve the overall leaching of metals\
        \ at a rate faster than water.Fig. 3Increasing leaching time to 96 h increases\
        \ extraction efficiency by an average of 73% between 24 and 96 h for Mg, Mn,\
        \ Fe, Co, and Ni. Biolixiviants from wild-type G. oxydans leached dunite at\
        \ 1% pulp density for 96 h, shaking at 22 \xB0C. Mg, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni concentrations\
        \ were measured from leachates every 24 h for 96 h. Error bars indicate standard\
        \ deviation of measurements from duplicate measurements.TheG. oxydans biolixiviant\
        \ is only 6% better than gluconic acid at 1% pulp densityA secondary control\
        \ was performed using only gluconic acid diluted with deionized water to the\
        \ same pH as the acid biolixiviants produced by G. oxydans. Reed et al.42\
        \ and Antonick et al.49 demonstrated that biolixiviants produced by G. oxydans\
        \ were noticeably more effective at bioleaching than gluconic acid alone.\
        \ However, recent anecdotal evidence suggests this is not the case under all\
        \ conditions. In our hands, when bioleaching ultramafic materials at low pulp\
        \ density (1%), G. oxydans-produced biolixiviants only slightly outperform\
        \ gluconic acid in leaching most metals (Fig. 2). Wild-type G. oxydans biolixiviants\
        \ leached only 6% more magnesium compared to pure gluconic acid that was diluted\
        \ with ultrapure water to the same pH after 24 h of leaching. Furthermore,\
        \ at least with low pulp density leaching, filtering cells from the biolixiviant\
        \ did not significantly affect bioleaching, at least under the conditions\
        \ of these tests (Fig. 4). This was done to assess if there was a significant\
        \ residual effect of microbial activity on leaching after biolixiviant production.\
        \ Furthermore, stoppering flasks during leaching to prevent gas exchange did\
        \ not significantly affect bioleaching (Figure S5). Later in the article,\
        \ we ask if there are conditions under which the G. oxydans biolixiviant has\
        \ a significant performance advantage for bioleaching ultramafic materials.Fig.\
        \ 4Filtering cells from theG. oxydans biolixiviant does not notably reduce\
        \ the bioleaching of metals from dunite after 24-hour leaching. We compared\
        \ Bioleaching of 1% dunite by sugar water (col. 1), with whole cell lixiviant\
        \ (col. 2), and with a biolixiviant that was clarified by filtration with\
        \ a 0.22 \u03BCm syringe filter (col. 3). Filtered and unfiltered biolixiviants\
        \ were at identical pH, produced from duplicate colonies, and were added to\
        \ ultramafic minerals in identical conditions. Filtering biolixiviants before\
        \ bioleaching resulted in similar metal concentrations when compared to whole-cell\
        \ biolixiviants when leaching dunite. A Welch\u2019s two-sample t-test shows\
        \ that no significant difference was detected between the unfiltered and filtered\
        \ groups, with p-values ranging from 0.2 to 0.9. This indicates that based\
        \ on a 24-hour leaching study, the presence of G. oxydans does not significantly\
        \ improve or diminish the effect of the biolixiviant on leaching in short\
        \ term leaching.Cellulosic hydrolysate can be used as an alternative sugar\
        \ feedstock for bioleachingTechno-economic analysis shows that glucose feedstock\
        \ for biolixiviant production is the biggest cost driver in REE biomining\
        \ with G. oxydans, accounting for almost half of the total cost61. Furthermore,\
        \ the sheer scale that carbon sequestration needs to operate at, means that\
        \ enormous amounts of feedstock will be required, potentially placing a significant\
        \ demand on the world\u2019s biomass supply62.Lignocellulose, found in agricultural\
        \ waste, can be a renewable carbon source for microbial growth and production\
        \ once monomeric sugars are released through acid pretreatment and enzymatic\
        \ hydrolysis, making a glucose-rich cellulosic hydrolysate63,64. Lignocellulosic\
        \ sugars are being increasingly investigated as a potential alternative sugar\
        \ source for several applications, including biofuels/bioethanol production\
        \ and substrates for cellular production. Utilizing lignocellulose-derived\
        \ sugars could serve as a high glucose replacement feedstock that would greatly\
        \ improve the cost-efficiency of bioleaching for carbon capture technologies65,66.\
        \ G. oxydans has been shown to be able to convert the glucose and xylose sugars\
        \ in cellulosic hydrolysate into gluconic acid and xylonic acid at extremely\
        \ high efficiencies67\u201369. Replacing pure glucose with cellulosic hydrolysate\
        \ could further improve the economic and environmental viability of bio-accelerated\
        \ weathering.G. oxydans has been shown to efficiently produce gluconic acid\
        \ and xylonic acid from lignocellulosic hydrolysate feedstocks67\u201369,\
        \ making industrial-scale, bio-accelerated carbon mineralization far more\
        \ economically feasible. We investigated if biolixiviants produced from cellulosic\
        \ hydrolysate, rather than pure glucose, could be effective at leaching dunite.\
        \ The cellulosic hydrolysate (CH) used in this study is a glucose-rich solution\
        \ produced from the enzymatic hydrolysis of concentrated corn stover (Table\
        \ S3).Biolixiviants produced from cellulosic hydrolysate were on average 28%\
        \ less effective in leaching magnesium compared to glucose-based biolixiviants\
        \ (Fig. 5). Leaching of Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni was also reduced by an average\
        \ of 52% compared to glucose-based biolixiviants (Fig. 5). Dunite was added\
        \ at 1% pulp density, and a leaching comparison between CH-based and glucose-based\
        \ lixiviants was conducted in parallel and in identical conditions. The cellulosic\
        \ hydrolysate added was diluted with deionized water so that the total sugar\
        \ concentrations were equal to the amount of glucose added for glucose-based\
        \ biolixiviants.Fig. 5Use of cellulosic hydrolysate as a biolixiviant feedstock\
        \ does not considerably reduce bioleaching efficiency. Panels (A) to (E) show\
        \ comparison of bioleaching of Mg, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni by Gluconobacter oxydans\
        \ when using glucose and cellulosic hydrolysate (CH) as as biolixiviant feedstock.\
        \ CH-based biolixiviant leaches magnesium on average at 72% the efficacy of\
        \ glucose-based biolixiviant. Leaching was performed with 1% dunite shaking\
        \ at 22 \xB0C for 24 h. Stars denote significant difference compared with\
        \ glucose-based biolixiviants by a Welch\u2019s two-sample t-test, where,\
        \ p < 0.05 (*), p < 0.01 (**), p < 0.001 (***).Despite a 28% average reduction\
        \ in Mg leaching, we were unable to detect a statistically meaningful difference\
        \ between glucose- and CH-based leaching of Mg using a Welch\u2019s two-sample\
        \ t-test. This was due to the small sample size and variability in CH-based\
        \ biolixiviant leachate measurements. Data collected for CH-based biolixiviants\
        \ resulted in greater variability than data with glucose-based biolixiviants.\
        \ ICP-MS analysis of cellulosic hydrolysate samples showed that the CH used\
        \ in this study contains trace concentrations of metals, possibly as a result\
        \ of the manufacturing process (Table S4). When calculating the amounts of\
        \ metal leached from CH-based biolixiviants, the concentrations of metal in\
        \ a cellulosic hydrolysate control study were subtracted from the total detected\
        \ to eliminate metal concentrations that were not extracted from dunite. In\
        \ low pulp density studies, the concentrations of metals in the cellulosic\
        \ hydrolysate feedstock interfered with metals leached, resulting in higher\
        \ overall error.Cellulosic hydrolysate produced from corn stover contains\
        \ several toxins such as organic acids, furan derivatives, and phenolic compounds\
        \ that could inhibit the growth of G. oxydans and its production of biolixiviant70.\
        \ Cellulosic hydrolysate also significantly increases viscosity, resulting\
        \ in lower oxygen transfer rates that limit the fermentation of glucose to\
        \ gluconic acid68. Despite this, leaching results show that G. oxydans can\
        \ produce a biolixiviant from cellulosic hydrolysate capable of leaching metals\
        \ at concentrations significantly greater than controls; however, further\
        \ analysis and experimentation are needed to show if CH can be a viable replacement\
        \ to glucose without a significant reduction in performance.Although cellulosic\
        \ hydrolysate contains mild antibiotic properties due to its acidity and certain\
        \ toxic compounds, this could be advantageous for the industrial scale use\
        \ of it as a feedstock for biolixiviant production. G. oxydans has high acid\
        \ resistance and is capable of growing and producing biolixiviant with cellulosic\
        \ hydrolysate, while many other microbes have low tolerance mechanisms for\
        \ it. This could allow for cellulosic hydrolysate to be used as an ultra-low-cost\
        \ feedstock while also preventing the growth of competing microbes. The toxic\
        \ components of cellulosic hydrolysate could also be a genetic engineering\
        \ target for G. oxydans, where mutants that have better resistance mechanisms\
        \ can be selected for to improve biolixiviant production.G. oxydans mutant\
        \ strain\u0394pstS, P112:mgdh improved magnesium leaching by 12% over wild-typeA\
        \ preliminary study using the mutant strain G. oxydans \u0394pstS, P112:mgdh43\
        \ shows that under identical growth and leaching conditions, mutant strains\
        \ of G. oxydans can be more effective than wild-type in leaching magnesium\
        \ and energy-critical metals from dunite.A bioleaching analysis over 96 h\
        \ using dunite at 1% pulp density was conducted with biolixiviant from wild-type\
        \ and mutant G. oxydans. Bioleachate samples were taken and analyzed every\
        \ 24 h up to 96 h using ICP-MS. The strain used is G. oxydans \u0394pstS,\
        \ P112:mgdh, which was engineered to improve acid production for metal leaching43.\
        \ It contains a clean deletion of the pstS gene which is involved in phosphate\
        \ signaling and transport44, and an up-regulation with promoter P112 of the\
        \ mgdh gene (Membrane-bound Glucose DeHydrogenase) which is critical for converting\
        \ glucose into gluconic acid71. The \u0394pstS, P112:mgdh mutant was previously\
        \ shown to decrease the pH of biolixiviants compared to wild-type, and it\
        \ increases the overall leaching of REE43. The biolixiviant produced from\
        \ the \u0394pstS, P112:mgdh mutant had a pH of 2.01 \xB1 0.02 across all replicates,\
        \ while the pH of wild-type biolixiviants were 2.39 \xB1 0.02.The analysis\
        \ shows that \u0394pstS, P112:mgdh mutant biolixiviant increases magnesium\
        \ leaching by an average of 12% over all samples taken between 24 and 96 h\
        \ of leaching. Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni had an average improvement in leaching of\
        \ 12% using mutant biolixiviant compared to wild-type (Fig. 6).Fig. 6Bioleaching\
        \ efficiency of magnesium increased by an average of 12% when leaching with\
        \ a high performingG. oxydans mutant. The G. oxydans mutant contains a deletion\
        \ of pstS phosphate signaling and transport gene, alongside up-regulation\
        \ of the mgdh gene that codes for the Membrane-bound Glucose DeHydrogenase\
        \ (MGDH) with the P112 promoter (G. oxydans \u0394pstS, P112:mdgh). Leaching\
        \ was done with dunite at 1% pulp density shaking at 22 \xB0C over 96 h. Stars\
        \ and dots denote a statistically significant difference between wild-type\
        \ G. oxydans and G. oxydans \u0394pstS, P112:mdgh mutant by a Welch\u2019\

        \ 0.001 (***).The entire genome of G. oxydans is yet to be completely characterized,\
        \ and several other genes may exist that are critical in controlling metal\
        \ leaching from ultramafic rocks. Future work to characterize the genome of\
        \ G. oxydans in terms of its functions related to ultramafic leaching is vital\
        \ to engineer better mutant strains that can improve the performance of bio-accelerated\
        \ weathering. The \u0394pstS, P112:mgdh mutant is engineered to maximize gluconic\
        \ acid production; however, studies have shown that for rare earths leaching,\
        \ G. oxydans mutants can be screened to identify genes that specifically affect\
        \ rare earth extraction50. Our research group has created a quality-controlled\
        \ (QC) whole genome knockout collection for G. oxydans B58, containing a collection\
        \ of 2,733 transposon disruption mutants, each with a different nonessential\
        \ gene disrupted. This QC collection enables a high-throughput screen of the\
        \ G. oxydans genome, selecting for significant changes to dunite leaching\
        \ efficacy. This will provide us with a roadmap for genetically engineering\
        \ G. oxydans for greater ultramafic bio-accelerated weathering capability.G.\
        \ oxydans biolixiviants are 3.2\xD7 more effective than gluconic acid at 60%\
        \ pulp densityAt higher pulp densities and longer leaching times, Gluconobacter\
        \ oxydans biolixiviants significantly outperformed gluconic acid at the same\
        \ pH. We compared Gluconobacter oxydans biolixiviants and gluconic acid metal\
        \ leaching with 5%, 10%, and 60% dunite pulp density, where leachate metal\
        \ concentrations were measured every 24 h for 72 h. The gluconic acid was\
        \ diluted with ultrapure deionized water to match the pH of biolixiviants,\
        \ and leaching was performed in identical conditions with the same mineral\
        \ substrates (DUN-2). After 72 h of leaching, wild-type biolixiviants leached\
        \ 1.74 times more magnesium than gluconic acid from 5% dunite, 2.87 times\
        \ more from 10% dunite, and 3.25 times more from 60% dunite (Fig. 7). At higher\
        \ pulp densities, Gluconobacter oxydans biolixiviants exhibit significantly\
        \ higher leaching efficiency than gluconic acid. This analysis suggests that\
        \ metal leaching from dunite is not only controlled by acidolysis, but might\
        \ contain other biologically-synthesized components that amplify extraction50.Fig.\
        \ 7At 60% pulp density, the wild-typeG. oxydans biolixiviant was 3.2\xD7 more\
        \ effective at bioleaching dunite than gluconic acid diluted to the same pH\
        \ with pure water. A comparative bioleaching study was conducted comparing\
        \ the leaching efficacy of wild-type G. oxydans biolixiviants and just gluconic\
        \ acid at the same pH. Magnesium concentrations in leachate were measured\
        \ after 24, 48, and 72 h of leaching with 5% (A), 10% (B), and 60% (C) dunite\
        \ (DUN-2). At higher dunite pulp densities, the improvement of Gluconobacter\
        \ oxydans biolixiviants compared to gluconic acid was amplified. After 72\
        \ h, biolixiviants were 74% better than gluconic acid at leaching 5% dunite,\
        \ 1.87 times better at leaching 10% dunite, and 2.25 times better at leaching\
        \ 60% dunite. Stars denote significant difference between gluconic acid leaching\

        \ enough to make a significant demand on the world\u2019s biomass supply62.\
        \ Therefore, it is essential to prioritize maximizing carbon dioxide sequestration\

        \ (Fig. 8), resulting in a kseq of 57, since glucose input remained unchanged.\
        \ For the lowest kseq values achieved, fine-particle dunite at a pulp density\
        \ of 60% was leached for 19 days with three different methods (Fig. 8 Leaching\
        \ Attempts #12\u201314). The first method (Fig. 8 Leaching Attempt #12) was\
        \ direct addition of 60% dunite, the second method (Leaching Attempt #13)\
        \ was a 2-step dunite addition, where 30% dunite was added on day 0 and another\
        \ 30% added on day 10, and the third method (Leaching Attempt #14) was a 2-step\
        \ dunite addition where the first 30% dunite feed was removed from the leachate\
        \ before the second 30% addition on day 10. All three leaching methods resulted\
        \ in a kseq equal to or less than 1.0, with the lowest kseq being 0.96 on\
        \ Leaching Attempt #13 in Fig. 8.Fig. 8Process and genetic improvements reduce\
        \ the amount of feedstock carbon needed to potentially sequester one CO2 molecule\
        \ from 525 to 1. Increasing leaching time, pulp density, and reducing average\
        \ particle sizes were able to reduce kseq (glucose carbon investment vs. carbon\
        \ sequestration ratio) by several orders of magnitude. Increasing dunite pulp\
        \ density from 1\u201310% had a larger impact in reducing kseq than increasing\
        \ leaching time from 1 to 10 days. Combining the \u0394pstS, P112:mdgh double\
        \ mutant with high pulp densities and long leaching times resulted in a kseq\
        \ value of 1 in three experiments (Col. 10\u201312). Leaching attempts #1\u2013\
        9 used DUN-1 and attempts #10\u201312 used DUN-3 with a particle size of less\
        \ than 74 microns as the leaching substrate.What implications do these results\
        \ have for CO2 sequestration? For kseq = 525, when using glucose as a feedstock,\
        \ the cost of sequestering 1 tonne of CO2 is $358,000, a long way above the\
        \ US Department of Energy\u2019s (DOE) target of $100 per tonne72, and well\
        \ above existing technologies31. On the other hand, if we could reduce kseq\
        \ to 1 (as in Fig. 8) at industrial scale, the cost of carbon sequestration\
        \ (at least the microbial feedstock part of the cost) through bio-accelerated\
        \ weathering starts to become comparable to (still high) current technologies,\
        \ at $682 per tonne31. If we could reduce kseq to 0.15 (about a 6-fold reduction\
        \ over our best attempt, much smaller than the reduction we achieved in the\
        \ course of writing this article) then we could reduce the feedstock cost\
        \ for sequestering 1 tonne of CO2 to $100. This would not account for the\
        \ costs of mining ultramafic material, but nor does it account for the offset\
        \ cost of energy-critical metal recovery. However, using this to sequester\
        \ 20 gigatonnes of CO2 a year5 would require 2 billion tonnes of glucose,\
        \ over 10 times current global annual sugar production73.Sugars derived from\
        \ cellulosic biomass are potentially much more abundant than glucose that\
        \ is derived from cereal crops like corn, sugar cane, and sugar beet74. While\
        \ there is no widespread production of cellulosic sugars today that is not\
        \ immediately diverted to cellulosic ethanol production, this could happen\
        \ in the future. Furthermore, it is estimated that cellulosic sugar production\
        \ could be as low as $100 per tonne75 (in contrast to around $1,000 per tonne\
        \ for glucose). Although cellulosic sugars are abundant, they are not limitless.\
        \ Slade et al.76, made estimates of global bioenergy supply, and concluded\
        \ that several tipping points would occur as the amount of biomass withdrawn\
        \ from the biosphere for bioenergy (or some other chemical production, such\
        \ as carbon sequestration) increased, forcing increasingly unpalatable choices\
        \ on global society including mass adoption of vegetarian diets, mass deforestation,\
        \ population control, or combinations thereof. Their analysis suggests that\
        \ the first global agricultural tipping point (choosing one of the three unpalatable\
        \ options) would occur when biomass was withdrawn at a rate of around 7 gigatonnes\
        \ per year62. Assuming that cellulosic sugars are on average a 50:50 mix of\
        \ C5 and C6 sugars, then to reduce the cellulosic biomass demand to sequester\
        \ 20 gigatonnes of CO2 to 3.5 gigatonnes, kseq needs only to be reduced to\
        \ 0.25.Although kseq serves as a useful metric for displaying sugar investment\
        \ in terms of CO2 sequestration potential, it is only a theoretical value\
        \ whose real value will depend on the conversion rates of downstream CO2 mineralization.\
        \ Since glucose inputs are a major cost driver in bio-accelerated weathering61,\
        \ kseq can help estimate lower-limit costs of scaled operations. Future scale-up\
        \ work will be necessary to formulate more accurate estimates of cost before\
        \ they can be compared with other direct CO2 mineralization technologies.Possibilities\
        \ for downstream carbon mineralizationOn its own, G. oxydans bioleachate saturated\
        \ with magnesium ions will be difficult to convert into stable carbonate minerals.\
        \ Due to the nature of acid leaching, the final pH of biolixiviants post-leaching\
        \ tended to be low (4\u20135) in our experiments, making carbon mineralization\
        \ chemically unfavorable. Since pH has a significant influence on the precipitation\
        \ of carbonates due to the lower availability of carbonate ions in acidic\
        \ conditions77,78, pH adjustments are required to increase carbonate mineral\
        \ yields downstream. Increasing the concentration of gaseous CO2 injected\
        \ or sparged through the leachate increases the total dissolved inorganic\
        \ carbon (DIC); however, this reduces the pH of the leachate, reducing carbonate\
        \ ion availability and decreasing the saturation index of carbonate minerals2,77.A\
        \ possible downstream pathway to adjust the pH of leachates to make carbon\
        \ dioxide complexation chemically favorable is to add ammonia from biological\
        \ or natural sources to synthesize magnesite, MgCO3, or nesquehonite, MgCO3\xB7\
        3H2O. Adding ammonia to CO2-sparged magnesium chloride solutions at ambient\
        \ temperatures was shown to completely convert free magnesium ions into nesquehonite\
        \ in about ten minutes79. Furthermore, ammonia can be recycled in this process\
        \ through recovery of ammonia using activated carbon, which has been shown\
        \ to recover ammonium chloride salts and separate them into ammonia and hydrochloric\
        \ acid at near ambient conditions80. Another possibility is to simply add\
        \ sodium hydroxide that has been electrically synthesized from carbon-neutral\
        \ pathways.Microbes that accelerate carbon mineralization, such as cyanobacteria,\
        \ have been observed to accelerate mineralization in legacy alkaline mine\
        \ tailings34,35. Coupling bio-accelerated weathering from Gluconobacter oxydans\
        \ with biotic downstream processes could maximize carbonate precipitation\
        \ in a low-resource and energy-efficient process that could be genetically\
        \ engineered further.Scale-Up and future stepsIn order to show that bio-accelerated\
        \ weathering is a feasible option for gigatonne-scale CO2 sequestration, future\
        \ work will be required to show that a scaled-up bioprocess is possible without\
        \ a significant reduction in efficiency compared to the bench-scale experiments\
        \ shown here.Bench-scale lab results rarely have equal yields and efficiencies\
        \ when scaled up to pilot- or industrial-scale bioprocesses. Being an obligate\
        \ aerobe, G. oxydans requires air exchange and consistent mixing for optimal\
        \ growth. Furthermore, optimized mixing of the mineral substrate with biolixiviants,\
        \ rate of glucose supplementation, rate of mineral addition, and optimized\
        \ particle sizes for leaching are yet to be thoroughly investigated. To address\
        \ these scale-up challenges, all process parameters will need to be investigated\
        \ in bioreactor experiments.Another consideration is how cell viability changes\
        \ throughout the leaching process. G. oxydans has been shown to be resilient\
        \ in high metal concentrations11, unlike several other microbes. However,\
        \ having high pulp densities of dunite would be a growth challenge for G.\
        \ oxydans. Despite this, cell viability during leaching may not be a critical\
        \ parameter for the effectiveness of leaching by G. oxydans biolixiviants.\
        \ For short term leaching, it is shown that having cells present in the biolixiviant\
        \ has an insignificant effect on leaching (Fig. 4). Since biolixiviants are\
        \ produced in an independent step before leaching begins (Figure S1), it is\
        \ not essential to have live cells present during leaching. However, possible\
        \ direct microbe-mineral interactions and continued acid production may have\
        \ an effect on long-term leaching and scaled processes.Overcoming the deceleration\
        \ of leaching over time is also a future scale-up challenge to address. The\
        \ rates of leaching were shown to slow down over the 96 h they were monitored\
        \ (Fig. 3). As ultramafic minerals are dissolved by biolixiviants, passivation\
        \ layers can form from amorphous silica (Note S1) or other mineral byproducts.\
        \ Furthermore, as the solution nears saturation of metal cations, dissolution\
        \ rates are expected to stagnate. Future investigations into overcoming the\
        \ passivation layers and developing integrated mineralization technologies\
        \ to allow for continuous leaching will be necessary for scale-up.Utilizing\
        \ lignocellulosic-based sugars as an alternative sugar feedstock also poses\
        \ a challenge in scale-up. Although G. oxydans has been shown to effectively\
        \ produce biolixiviants from cellulosic hydrolysate, the state of lignocellulosic\
        \ sugar production is underdeveloped. Large-scale production of sugars derived\
        \ from second-generation biomass (lignocellulose) is still limited, and developments\
        \ in improving efficiency and yield are ongoing. Advances in the supply chain\
        \ of lignocellulosic biomass and optimization in pretreatment and enzymatic\
        \ hydrolysis will be necessary in the near future for the large-scale implementation\
        \ of lignocellulosic-based sugars for bio-accelerated weathering66.\",\"discussion\"\
        :\"ConclusionThis article shows that G. oxydans possesses the capability to\
        \ bioleach metals for energy technologies and carbon mineralization from dunite.\
        \ At low pulp densities (1%), the G. oxydans organic acid-based biolixiviant\
        \ is 20\xD7 more effective at Mg leaching than deionized water. At high pulp\
        \ densities (60%), the biolixiviant is 3.2\xD7 better than even gluconic acid\
        \ alone. This suggests that microbially-accelerated weathering of ultramafic\
        \ materials could be an environmentally-friendly method for supplying Mg for\
        \ mineralization of CO2, and metals like Ni and Co for sustainable energy\
        \ technologies at rates that can far exceed equivalent abiotic methods.Several\
        \ pH swing methods have been shown to be highly effective for greatly accelerating\
        \ olivine carbonation7,81. However, scaling up these technologies to meet\
        \ the world\u2019s CO2 removal requirements may involve high energy costs82\
        \ and environmental drawbacks like those found in strong acid leaching involved\
        \ with large scale energy-critical metal mining. Other methods of accelerated\
        \ weathering involving energy-intensive preprocessing of mineral feedstocks\
        \ by crushing, grinding, and chemically treating ultramafic rocks also come\
        \ with their own environmental and scaling drawbacks. In situ accelerated\
        \ ultramafic weathering can result in environmental leaching and environmental\
        \ drainage of harmful doses of nickel, chromium, and cobalt59,83\u201385.\
        \ These methods also involve slow kinetics that depend on high energy inputs\
        \ to be accelerated and enormous land use7,28,82,86.Bio-accelerated weathering\
        \ may be an alternative approach to mineral weathering for carbon mineralization.\
        \ When engineered further, this strategy may prove an economically-viable\
        \ and scalable option that avoids the environmental concerns with in situ\
        \ mechanically-accelerated weathering and strong acid leaching51,59,84,85,87,\
        \ as well as the energy costs involved in high temperature and pressure reactions14,82.\
        \ Energy requirements for heating in common abiotic carbonation processes,\
        \ such as ammonium salts-driven pH swings and HCl pH swings, often result\
        \ in CO2 emissions greater than the amount sequestered82. G. oxydans-based\
        \ bioleaching was shown to be effective at ambient temperature and pressure,\
        \ removing a major energy burden for this process.In this article, we were\
        \ able to reduce the number of carbon atoms in glucose needed to sequester\
        \ one molecule of CO2 from 525 to 1. However, further work needs to be done\
        \ to optimize G. oxydans for enhanced weathering for carbon mineralization.\
        \ Maximizing the leaching of magnesium while minimizing carbon inputs and\
        \ lowering the economic costs are key steps to making this technology viable\
        \ for eliminating the several gigatonnes of carbon dioxide in excess on our\

              \ definitions of biological complexity have been proposed: the number\
              \ of genes, cell types, or metabolic\\nprocesses within an organism.\
              \ As knowledge of biological systems has increased, it has become apparent\
              \ that these metrics\\nare often incongruent. Methodology. Here we propose\
              \ an alternative complexity metric based on the number of genetically\\\
              nuncorrelated phenotypic traits contributing to an organism\u2019s fitness.\
              \ This metric, phenotypic complexity, is more objective\\nthan previous\
              \ suggestions, as complexity is measured from a fundamental biological\
              \ perspective, that of natural selection. We\\nutilize a model linking\
              \ the equilibrium fitness (drift load) of a population to phenotypic\
              \ complexity. We then use results from\\nviral evolution experiments\
              \ to compare the phenotypic complexities of two viruses, the bacteriophage\
              \ X174 and vesicular\\nstomatitis virus, and to illustrate the consistency\
              \ of our approach and its applicability. Conclusions/Significance. Because\\\
              nDarwinian evolution through natural selection is the fundamental element\
              \ unifying all biological organisms, we propose that\\nour metric of\
              \ complexity is potentially a more relevant metric than others, based\
              \ on the count of artificially defined set of\\nobjects.\\n\\nCitation:\

              \ doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0000217\\n\\nINTRODUCTION\\nA persistent\
              \ question in biology is how organismal complexity\\nthrough the course\
              \ of evolution [1\u20135]. Although\\nchanges\\nsignificant progress\
              \ has been made in the understanding and\\nquantifying organismal characteristics\
              \ at many level of organiza-\\ntion (DNA, proteins, metabolic networks,\
              \ cellular organization,\\norgan functions,\\nindividual behavior) much\
              \ confusion remains\\nabout how to accurately quantify organismal complexity.\
              \ Several\\nintuitive proposals have been made that take into account\
              \ simple\\nmetrics such as the number of genes or cell types. However,\
              \ these\\nsimple measures quickly lead to conflicting conclusions [2,3].\
              \ Here\\nwe propose a fundamentally different approach to measuring\\\
              norganismal complexity; as opposed to relying on bottom-up\\nmeasures\
              \ such as the number of genes an organism has, we utilize\\nan objective\
              \ biological approach: natural selection. Instead of\\nasking how complex\
              \ an organism is from our own perspective, we\\nask: how complex is\
              \ an organism from the perspective of natural\\nselection? Essentially,\
              \ this is a top-down metric of organismal\\ncomplexity that we term\
              \ phenotypic complexity.\\n\\nPhenotypic complexity quantifies the number\
              \ of genetically\\nuncorrelated phenotypic traits contributing to an\
              \ organism\u2019s\\nfitness. A phenotypic trait contributes to an organism\u2019\
              s fitness\\nonly to the extent that natural selection acts upon that\
              \ trait. Thus\\nan organismal phenotype that is no longer under selection\
              \ (for\\nexample during an evolutionary transition from a generalist\
              \ to\\nspecialist lifestyle), although expressed by the organism, contri-\\\
              ntwo\\nbutes nothing to organismal complexity. Secondly,\\nphenotypes\
              \ contribute to complexity, they must be genetically\\nseparable: some\
              \ mutations must exist that affect one phenotype\\nbut not the other.\
              \ If no such mutations exist, then although we\\nmay perceive two phenotypes\
              \ under selection, these phenotypes\\ncontribute only a single trait\\\
              ntoward determining phenotypic\\ncomplexity. As an example consider\
              \ the affinity of an enzyme for\\na substrate, and the rate at which\
              \ that substrate is converted to\\nproduct. If there are no mutations\
              \ that affect one of these traits but\\nnot the other, then these two\
              \ phenotypes are considered one, until\\n\\nif\\n\\nthe organism gains\
              \ the genetic complexity to generate variation in\\none phenotype without\
              \ affecting the second,\\nfor example by\\nevolving functionally separate\
              \ domains in the enzyme. Phenotypic\\ncomplexity is thus a combined\
              \ description of how natural selection\\nperceives organismal phenotypes\
              \ and how phenotypic variation is\\ngenerated by the organism. This\
              \ concept was first articulated by\\nOrr, and followed later by others\
              \ [6\u20138]. Notably, it is similar to\\nthe amount of\\nphysical complexity,\
              \ which is a measure of\\ninformation that an organism encodes about\
              \ its environment [4,5].\\nAn important aspect of measuring complexity\
              \ in this manner is\\nthat both the organism and the environment affect\
              \ the metric. An\\norganism with many phenotypes, but living in simple\
              \ environment\\ncould thus be just as complex as a simpler organism\
              \ in the same\\nenvironment. For example,\\nif one organism is capable\
              \ of\\nmetabolizing both lactose and glucose, while second can\\nmetabolize\
              \ only glucose, the first organism will only be designated\\nas more\
              \ complex when there is a possibility that lactose will be\\npresent\

              n\\n\\fRecent population genetic theory [9,10] has suggested that\\\
              nphenotypic complexity is proportional to the drift load, a quantity\\\
              nthat describes how equilibrium mean population fitness declines\\nwith\
              \ population size. This can be intuitively understood in the\\nfollowing\
              \ manner. An organism\u2019s fitness is a result of how\\nsuccessfully\
              \ it interacts with the environment. As the number of\\ninteractions\
              \ (traits) increases, it becomes difficult to simultaneously\\nmaintain\
              \ each one. Very large populations maintain nearly\\noptimal mean population\
              \ fitness regardless of phenotypic com-\\nplexity. Small populations\
              \ can maintain high average fitness only\\nwhen there are a small number\
              \ of traits (low complexity) each\\ncontributing a relatively large\
              \ amount to fitness; if there are a large\\nnumber of traits (high complexity),\
              \ each contributing only a small\\namount to fitness, then small populations\
              \ will be incapable of\\nmaintaining all of them. Thus for complex organisms,\
              \ there will be\\na large difference in mean fitness between small and\
              \ large\\npopulations; for simple organisms, this difference in average\
              \ fitness\\nwill be small.\\n\\nfirst\\n\\nThe phenotypic model used\
              \ to link drift load to phenotypic\\ncomplexity was\\nformalized by\
              \ R. A. Fisher [11]. He\\nenvisioned a multidimensional phenotypic space\
              \ in which the\\norigin of each axis corresponded to the most-fit or\
              \ optimum\\nphenotypic value. As phenotypic values depart from the origin,\\\
              nfitness decreases. The manner in which fitness declines is described\\\
              nby a monotonically decreasing function, which may take a variety\\\
              nof shapes, e.g., linear, concave-up, or \u2013down. Individuals of\
              \ equal\\nfitness but different phenotypic values trace out fitness\
              \ isoclines in\\nthe space. If an organism has only two phenotypes,\
              \ the phenotypic\\nspace is two-dimensional and the fitness isoclines\
              \ are a series of\\ncircles centered on the origin of the axes (Fig.\
              \ 1). If an organism\\nhas n number of phenotypes, phenotypic space\
              \ is n-dimensional,\\nand each fitness\\nisocline is an n-dimensional\
              \ hyper-sphere.\\nBecause of the assumed geometry of the isoclines,\
              \ this model is\\nreferred to as Fisher\u2019s Geometric Model (FGM)\
              \ of phenotypic or\\nadaptive evolution.\\n\\nA population of individuals\
              \ can be represented as a collection of\\npoints in FGM and the phenotypic\
              \ values of each point allow\\nascertainment of the fitness of each\
              \ individual. Individual fitness\\nthen determines the probability of\
              \ each individual surviving and\\nreproducing the next generation. Evolution\
              \ is thus described in\\nFGM by following the collection of points over\
              \ many generations.\\nTo generate novel genetic variation, mutations\
              \ are drawn from an\\nassumed distribution that is centered on the phenotypic\
              \ position of\\neach individual (Fig. 1). By never descending into genotypic\
              \ space,\\nFGM is analogous to quantitative genetics models. Both types\
              \ of\\nmodels assume or require only that a component of phenotype is\\\
              nheritable. However, whereas quantitative genetic models represent\\\
              npopulations by their mean and variance, FGM is an individual-\\nbased\
              \ model in which each individual is evaluated according to its\\nfitness.\\\
              n\\nFGM makes a set of\\n\\ntheoretical predictions about how\\nadaptation\
              \ tends\\nthese have been\\nto occur, and many of\\ncorroborated by\
              \ experimental results. The greater frequency of\\nsmall-sized beneficial\
              \ mutations [12], the L-shaped distribution of\\nmutations fixed throughout\
              \ evolution [13], the existence of fitness\\nequilibriums [14], and\
              \ the absence of intrinsically beneficial or\\nintrinsically deleterious\
              \ mutations have all been observed during\\nlaboratory evolution, and\
              \ all conform to the conditions set forth\\nthus appears to offer a\
              \ reasonable\\nunder FGM. The model\\nframework for the study of microbial\
              \ evolution.\\n\\nThe utility of FGM lies in the fact that it does not\
              \ require any\\nparticular assumptions about the map between phenotype\
              \ and\\ngenotype, and that the specific predictions about how fitness\\\
              nchanges during evolution appear to be robust. In the present\\n\\nPopulation\

              \ axes, with the maximum\\nfitness located, for convenience, at the\
              \ origin of these axes. Any\\nindividual in a population (black point)\
              \ can thus be described by its\\nphenotypic values, which determine\
              \ the fitness of that organism. At any\\nspecific fitness, there are\

              \ we term this the effective number of\\ndimensions), and Ne is the\
              \ effective population size. This confirms\\nthe results obtained by\
              \ Poon and Otto who approximated Feq(ne,\\nNe) as 2Ne/(2Ne+ne) [10].\\\
              n\\nAlthough earlier studies on FGM model have used such linear\\nfitness\
              \ functions (for the sake of mathematical simplicity), recent\\nexperimental\
              \ studies do not seem to support the use of such\\na function [17\u2013\
              19]. Linear fitness functions give rise to dramatic\\nsynergistic epistasis.\
              \ For example, a mutation that increases the\\ndistance to the optimal\
              \ phenotype by 0.1 units may decrease\\nfitness by 10% in the optimal\
              \ genotype (which by definition has\\na fitness of 1); an analogous\
              \ mutation will decrease fitness by 50%\\nin an organism with a fitness\
              \ of 0.2; this mutation will become\\nin any genotype with a fitness\
              \ less than 0.1. Recent\\nlethal\\nexperimental work suggests that epistasis\
              \ between deleterious\\nmutations is either antagonistic [17\u201319]\
              \ or null [20]. We therefore\\ndecided to use a family of exponential\\\
              nfitness functions with\\na parameter that allows control over the level\
              \ and shape of\\nepistasis.\\n\\nExponential-type Fitness Decline\\\
              nIn an effort to explore fitness functions more compatible with\\nexperimental\
              \ data, we studied the following family of functions.\\nf(d) = exp(2(dQ)),\\\
              nin which fitness is an exponentially decaying\\nfunction of the distance\
              \ to the optimum to the power of Q. Q is\\na parameter that modifies\
              \ the concavity of the fitness decline. As\\norganisms move away from\
              \ the optimum the effect of the mutation\\ntend to have bigger effect\
              \ if Q.1 and smaller effect if Q,1. In\\nsuch a case the fitness equilibriums\
              \ are (Methods, Appendix A).\\n\\nFeq ne, v\\n\xF0\\n\\n\xDE~ v= vz1\\\

              \ isoclines are ellipsoid while the mutation\\ncloud is circular [21].\
              \ Hence it seems that asymmetry in both the\\nmutational distribution\

              \ of the\\nfitness function.\\n\\nWe used a second set of data from\
              \ the literature, in which\\npopulations were evolved for 20 transfers\
              \ at different effective\\nsizes. Novella et al. [22] evolved four clones\
              \ of vesicular stomatitis\\nvirus (VSV) using plaque-to-plaque transfers\
              \ of sizes two, five, and\\nfitness\\n30. They also observed a population\
              \ size-dependant\\nconvergence. Although the time for convergence was\
              \ relatively\\nshort (40 viral generations), several populations experienced\
              \ no\\nsignificant increases or decreases in fitness over all replicates\
              \ at\\na given population size, suggesting that those population were\
              \ at or\\nnear an equilibrium fitness value. We used the fitness estimates\\\
              nfrom 24 populations evolved at population sizes of two, five and\\\
              n30. Every transfer corresponded to roughly two viral generations\\\
              nand effective population size was thus approximated as two times\\\
              nthe number of viral plaques transferred.\\n\\nAdditionally, an impressive\
              \ set of data using site directed\\nmutagenesis in VSV suggests that\
              \ the concavity of fitness function\\nis slightly upward [19]. However,\
              \ in further analyses we estimate\\nQ as 1 for both the phage and the\
              \ virus, as no clear departure from\\n1 has been observed in either\
              \ case.\\n\\nEstimates of Phenotypic Complexity for VSV and\\nwX174\\\
              nWe applied the maximum likelihood estimator to the experimental\\nestimates\
              \ of population fitness for wX174 and VSV, and using\\na likelihood\
              \ ratio test we defined 95% confidence intervals (CI),\\nwhich we list\
              \ here in parentheses. For wX174 we found ne/Q = 45\\n(42249), and fref\
              \ = 1.245 (1.2321.26), whereas for VSV we found\\nne/Q = 10 (8212) and\
              \ fref = 1.98 (1.9422.05) (Fig. 3). In both of\\nthese cases, fref is\
              \ calculated per generation relative to the ancestral\\nvirus for wX174\
              \ and relative to a reference strain for VSV. As no\\nstrong signature\
              \ of curvature in the fitness surface has been found\\nfor either virus,\
              \ we assume that Q is approximately one.\\n\\nDISCUSSION\\nTo understand\
              \ how biological complexity changes during the\\ncourse of evolution,\
              \ a metric is needed. Previously, measures such\\nas the number of genes,\
              \ cell types or metabolic processes have\\nthey often lead to incongruent\
              \ results.\\nbeen proposed, but\\nOrganisms with more cell types do\
              \ not necessarily have more\\ngenes. Here we suggest that a metric unifying\
              \ biological systems\\nhas not been appropriately identified. To circumvent\
              \ this problem,\\nwe have developed a metric of biological complexity\
              \ termed\\nphenotypic complexity (ne). We have quantified this metric\
              \ in the\\nviruses wX174 and VSV by utilizing a population genetic model\\\
              nthat describes how phenotypic complexity affects the drift load that\\\
              na population experiences.\\n\\nPhenotypic complexity (ne)\\n\\nis a\
              \ measure of the number of\\nthat are acted upon by\\ngenetically uncorrelated\
              \ phenotypes\\nnatural selection. Because Darwinian evolution through\
              \ natural\\nselection is\\nthe fundamental element unifying all biological\\\
              norganisms, we propose that ne is potentially a more relevant\\nmetric\
              \ than those previously suggested.\\n\\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org\\\

              \ the Model\\nUsing recent theoretical results we have analytically\
              \ quantified the\\ndependency of the drift load (equilibrium fitness)\
              \ on the effective\\npopulation size and phenotypic complexity. The\
              \ linear fitness\\nfunction that has been employed previously to simplify\
              \ the\\nmathematical analyses is no longer necessary. Such a function\\\
              nmakes strong assumptions about the form of the fitness landscape;\\\
              nspecifically, mutational effects become very large as fitness is\\\
              nreduced. Thus at low fitness most mutations are either lethal or of\\\
              nvery large effect, a scenario which is incompatible with what we\\\
              nhave previously observed [14].\\n\\nWe have therefore studied a more\
              \ general family of fitness\\nfunctions of the form f(d) = exp(2(dQ)),\
              \ and found that Feq(Ne,\\nne) = (12(2?Ne21)21)(ne/Q). It appears that\
              \ this equation remains\\nvalid over a much wider range of conditions\
              \ than those used in the\\ncanonical FGM, in which mutations are required\
              \ to be isotropic\\nand fitness isoclines are symmetric about the origin.\
              \ An interesting\\nfeature of this formula is that it does not require\
              \ a model in which\\nmutations can affect all phenotypic traits simultaneously.\
              \ In the\\ninitial formulation of FGM, all phenotypic axes intersect\
              \ at the\\norigin of each axis. This original FGM can be modified slightly\\\
              nsuch that some phenotypes are grouped into separate phenotypic\\nmodules,\
              \ and within a module, all phenotypes again intersect at\\neach other\u2019\
              s origin. Any mutation that occurs within a module can\\naffect only\
              \ other phenotypes within that module, and none that lie\\noutside of\
              \ it (i.e. there is no pleiotropy between modules, an idea\\nsimilar\
              \ to previous conceptions of modularity [23]). Using the\\nmore general\
              \ description of the equilibrium drift load that we have\\nderived above,\
              \ a phenotypic landscape a composed of a single\\nmodule with ne dimensions\
              \ has the same drift load function as\\na landscape composed of m independent\
              \ modules of size ne,i with\\nSi ne,i = ne because we have\\n\\n(cid:1)\\\

              n\\nOther Attempts to Estimate Phenotypic Complexity\\nRecently, another\
              \ theoretical study developed a framework to\\nestimate phenotypic complexity\
              \ [21]. The model developed used\\npredictions on the distribution of\
              \ mutational effects to estimate\\ncomplexity. This analysis, which\
              \ is completely independent from\\nours, found an interesting correlation\
              \ between gene number and\\ncomplexity in a variety of organisms ranging\
              \ from a virus to C.\\nelegans. However, for all the organisms for which\
              \ enough data\\nthe number of phenotypic\\nexisted to perform the analysis,\\\
              ndimensions estimated was very small; 0.21 phenotypic dimensions\\nfor\
              \ E. coli, 1.07 in VSV, 1\u20132 for S. cerevisiae, and 2\u20133 for\
              \ D.\\nmelanogaster and C. elegans. We think that several effects may\
              \ limit\\nthe predictive quality such a method. Firstly, mutation accumu-\\\
              nlation methods and the inherent noise in fitness estimates are very\\\
              ndifferent across species and comparison across species are thus\\ndifficult.\
              \ One illustration of this is the large variability in fitness\\nestimates\
              \ for mutations in a single species using two methods: in\\nVSV earlier\
              \ estimates (using Bateman-Mukai estimates) predicted\\na 0.002 mean\
              \ fitness effect per mutation, while more recent and\\naccurate estimates\
              \ (which introduced each mutation individually)\\nbrought the estimate\
              \ it to 14% (a 70-fold difference). Secondly,\\nneutral mutations are\
              \ not considered in the model developed by\\nMartin and Lenormand. However,\

              ncalculation of mean fitness effects of mutations even if they do\\\
              nnot affect any phenotype in the laboratory environment. Third,\\ncontrary\
              \ to our model, if phenotypes are organized in different\\nmodules (as\
              \ many data suggest), their model will provide different\\nestimates;\
              \ in other words, their model requires that all traits can be\\nsimultaneously\
              \ affected by a single mutations. All these considera-\\ntions suggest\
              \ that a second independent model should be used to\\nestimate phenotypic\
              \ complexity.\\n\\nOne of the central FGM hypotheses that we have so\
              \ far not\\naddressed is the single-peaked nature of the landscape.\
              \ Although\\nFGM contains few assumptions about the nature of the genotypic\\\
              nlandscape, the model explicitly requires a phenotypic landscape\\ncontaining\
              \ a single peak; without this, then the fitness function,\\nf(d), cannot\
              \ be described by a decreasing function. However,\\nrecent experimental\
              \ evidence over large evolutionary time scales\\nstrongly suggests that\
              \ while the genotypic landscape may contain\\nmultiple peaks, the phenotypic\
              \ landscape is generally much less\\ncomplex. Several experimental studies\
              \ using microbes have shown\\nthat a considerable amount of phenotypic\
              \ convergence occurs\\nduring evolution [24\u201327], even when organisms\
              \ begin from\\ndifferent starting points in the landscape [28]. These\
              \ phenomena\\nwould only be expected if the phenotypic landscape exhibited\\\
              na single-peak. However, the evidence for ruggedness in the genetic\\\
              nlandscape is also substantial, especially in experiments that have\\\
              nlooked at bacterial evolution of resistance to antibiotics [29]. In\\\
              nthis case, the fitness relationships between the wild type genotypes,\\\
              nresistant genotypes, compensated resistant genotypes, and sensitive\\\
              ngenotypes bearing the compensatory mutation exhibit high levels\\nof\
              \ epistasis, characteristic of a rugged genetic landscape. In other\\\
              nin which the cost of resistance was associated with\\nstudies\\na phenotype\
              \ [30],\\nfitness restoration to wild-type level was\\nsometimes observed\
              \ and, more importantly for our concern, it\\nthe phenotypic damage\\\
              nwas associated with a restoration of\\nthe resistance mutation\\nassociated\
              \ with the occurrence of\\n(transcription efficiency of\\nrifampicin\
              \ resistant mutants was\\nrestored back to the level observed in rifampicin\
              \ sensitive strain).\\nThis also suggests the singularity of the phenotypic\
              \ optimum,\\nalthough different genetic combinations may underlie this\\\
              nis focusing neither on the\\noptimum. However, as our model\\ngenetic\

              \ (ruggedness means that several mutations could be\\nneeded to restore\
              \ the effect of one) it should not be too sensitive to\\nthe small level\
              \ ruggedness of the genetic landscape described so\\nfar.\\n\\nThe Concept\
              \ of Phenotypic Complexity\\nAs discussed previously, the quantity denoted\
              \ by ne is the number\\nof genetically uncorrelated phenotypes that\
              \ are influenced by the\\naction of natural selection. The dimensions\
              \ enumerated by ne are\\nthus genetically orthogonal to each other,\
              \ and analogous to the\\naxes needed to describe the variation among\
              \ multiple phenotypes\\nmeasured on a collection of individuals and\
              \ mutants in a principal\\ncomponent analysis. However, the number of\
              \ axes enumerated by\\nne is filtered by natural selection, while in\
              \ a PCA analysis the\\nnumber of axes is limited only by the number\
              \ of independent\\nphenotypes\\nthat are measured. Because each phenotype\
              \ is\\noptimized at a value determined by each organism\u2019s ecological\\\
              nenvironment, there is a dependence of phenotypic complexity on\\nthe\
              \ complexity of\\nthe ecological niche experienced by each\\norganism;\
              \ if natural selection does not act on a phenotype, then\\nthat phenotype\
              \ does not contribute to the complexity metric.\\nFinally, although\
              \ the estimates of ne arise from an idealized model\\n\\nPLoS ONE |\

              n\\n\\fof phenotypic evolution; as Orr suggested previously, estimates\
              \ of\\nphenotypic complexity using FGM can be viewed as \u2018\u2018\
              effective\u2019\u2019\\nestimates of phenotypic complexity [6]. This\
              \ concept is analogous\\nto the concept in population genetics of effective\
              \ population size,\\nNe, in which two populations with different numbers\
              \ of individuals\\nand different sex ratios might have the same effective\
              \ population\\nsize and therefore respond similarly to the different\
              \ population\\ngenetic forces. Thus two organisms, although they may\
              \ differ in\\nboth the underlying genetic mechanisms and in the complexity\
              \ of\\nthe environment in which they live, may have similar phenotypic\\\
              ncomplexities. The utility of the concept lies not in the implications\\\
              nit makes about specific phenotypes or genetic details, but in that\
              \ it\\nenables a general quantification of how an organism is affected\
              \ by\\nnatural selection (the complexity with which natural selection\
              \ acts),\\nand furthermore, how this action affects\\nthe evolutionary\\\
              ndynamics of that organism [6].\\n\\nViral Estimates of Phenotypic Complexity\\\
              nUnsurprisingly, our estimates of phenotypic complexity are orders\\\
              nof magnitude smaller than either the number of nucleotides or\\neven\
              \ the number of amino acids encoded by the genomes of these\\norganisms\
              \ (5386 bp and 11,161bp in wX174 and VSV, respec-\\ntively). This agrees\
              \ with the concept of phenotypic complexity that\\nwe have defined.\
              \ Although mutations that occur at one nucleotide\\nor amino acid do\
              \ not affect\\nthey are\\ngenetically separable phenotypes), it is clearly\
              \ unlikely that each\\nnucleotide or amino acid is independently acted\
              \ up by natural\\nselection. Secondly, each estimate of complexity is\
              \ greater than the\\nnumber of genes encoded by each virus (11 and 5\
              \ for wX174 and\\nVSV, respectively). The presence of multiple functional\
              \ domains\\nwithin a single protein is consistent with an estimate of\
              \ complexity\\nthat is greater than the number of encoded proteins.\\\
              n\\nthose at another (i.e.\\n\\nAlthough we have only two estimates,\
              \ we can briefly consider\\nthem from a comparative standpoint: although\
              \ the genome size of\\nwX174 is half of VSV, our estimate of phenotypic\
              \ complexity\\nquantifies wX174 as being approximately four-fold more\
              \ complex.\\nIt is notable, then, that wX174 contains approximately\
              \ twice the\\nnumber of genes as VSV. Additionally, the lifestyle of\
              \ wX174 is\\narguably much more elaborate than that of VSV. wX174 interacts\\\
              nwith several host factors in order to perform transcription and\\nreplication;\
              \ 13 host factors are required for replication alone [31].\\nThis can\
              \ be contrasted with VSV, in which transcription and\\nreplication are\
              \ similar processes, both performed by the viral\\npolymerase. Few host\\\
              nfactors (and thus few interactions) are\\nnecessary at all during the\
              \ entire life cycle of VSV [32].\\n\\nThese estimates suggest that,\
              \ for very simple organisms such as\\nviruses, phenotypic complexity\
              \ correlates well with the number of\\ngenes in an organism, and more\
              \ specifically, with the number of\\ninteractions characteristic of\
              \ that organism [2]. This observation\\nsupports the idea that phenotypic\
              \ complexity depends on the\\ninteractions between an organism and its\
              \ environment. Genome\\nsize in itself seems to be a poor correlate\
              \ of phenotypic complexity,\\na notable result in consideration of the\
              \ very small genome sizes of\\nthese organisms. Whether\\nsuch correlations\
              \ or absence of\\ncorrelation with gene number or genome length would\
              \ hold for\\nmore complex organisms remains an open question. Nevertheless,\\\
              nby studying very simple organisms, we have shown that the use of\\\
              ndrift load could be used to estimate complexity in a novel and\\nconsistent\
              \ way. We now propose that such a method could be\\nhelpful to identify\
              \ and quantify the strongest determinants of\\nbiological complexity\
              \ of higher organisms.\\n\\nAlthough the theory presented here appears\
              \ to be quite robust,\\nit is too early to conclude that it is an accurate\
              \ reflection of the\\nunderlying biology. To be studied in an FGM framework,\\\
              n\\nPopulation Genetic Complexity\\n\\nfor population size-dependent\\\
              n\\norganisms need to present at least one phenotypic property to\\\
              nselection. Additionally, populations, even those of very small size,\\\
              nis explicitly\\nshould evolve towards a fitness equilibrium that\\\
              ndependent on population size. We found data in the literature\\nconsistent\
              \ with this expectation for one organism, VSV. We now\\nprovide further\
              \ support\\nfitness\\nequilibria by evolving populations of the bacteriophage\
              \ wX174.\\nTogether, these two data sets suggest that evolutionary analyses\\\
              nusing an FGM framework are a valid approach. Moreover, the use\\nof\
              \ very simple organisms such as viruses is useful for gaining insight\\\
              ninto metrics of complexity, as for such simple organisms, gene\\nnumber\
              \ is likely to be a very good correlate of organismal\\ncomplexity,\
              \ and this should be reflected by the metric. Although\\nour observations\

              \ are borne out. An assessment of\\ndrift load and phenotypic complexity\
              \ in a greater number of\\norganisms is needed before further conclusions\
              \ can be drawn.\\n\\nConclusions\\nHere we have presented a top-down\
              \ approach to quantifying\\nbiological complexity. This can be contrasted\
              \ with previously\\nproposed metrics of complexity, which have relied\
              \ on physically\\nmeasurable quantities of the organism (bottom-up approaches).\\\
              nTwo important conceptual differences separate these two ap-\\nproaches.\
              \ Most importantly, phenotypic complexity is dependent\\non both the\
              \ organism and the environmental context. An\\norganism is not complex\
              \ because it has many measurable\\nphenotypes; it is complex because\
              \ it has many phenotypes on\\nwhich natural selection acts. Secondly,\
              \ phenotypic complexity\\ndoes not rely on artificially constructed\
              \ concepts such as genes\\n[33]. As an example, if two genes are deemed\

              \ equivalent,\\nmeasure necessarily ignores the subtle ways in which\
              \ each may\\nbe regulated, or spliced, or expressed within the cell.\
              \ Quantify-\\ning such multiple layers of complexity is difficult if\
              \ the metric\\nrelies on physically measurable quantities.\\n\\nHowever,\
              \ phenotypic complexity remains an inherently abstract\\nmetric. It\
              \ cannot aid in identifying the specific characteristics\\ncontributing\
              \ to the complexity of an organism. Instead, it addresses\\nthe complexity\
              \ with which natural selection views an organism, and\\nthe complexity\
              \ with which an organism is capable of generating\\nnovel phenotypic\
              \ variation. For this reason, testing how phenotypic\\ncomplexity compares\
              \ to more traditional metrics of complexity (for\\nexample, the numbers\
              \ of genes, protein interactions, or cellular\\npathways) may provide\
              \ significant insight into biological systems.\\nFinally, phenotypic\
              \ complexity (and the resulting equilibrium drift\\nload) affords a\
              \ unique opportunity to contrast the action of natural\\nselection between\
              \ different organisms or different environments in\\na very general\
              \ and unconstrained manner.\\n\\nMETHODS\\nViral Evolution\\nThe details\

        \ Various definitions of biological complexity have been proposed: the number\
        \ of genes, cell types, or metabolic\\nprocesses within an organism. As knowledge\
        \ of biological systems has increased, it has become apparent that these metrics\\\
        nare often incongruent. Methodology. Here we propose an alternative complexity\
        \ metric based on the number of genetically\\nuncorrelated phenotypic traits\
        \ contributing to an organism\u2019s fitness. This metric, phenotypic complexity,\
        \ is more objective\\nthan previous suggestions, as complexity is measured\
        \ from a fundamental biological perspective, that of natural selection. We\\\
        nutilize a model linking the equilibrium fitness (drift load) of a population\
        \ to phenotypic complexity. We then use results from\\nviral evolution experiments\
        \ to compare the phenotypic complexities of two viruses, the bacteriophage\
        \ X174 and vesicular\\nstomatitis virus, and to illustrate the consistency\
        \ of our approach and its applicability. Conclusions/Significance. Because\\\
        nDarwinian evolution through natural selection is the fundamental element\
        \ unifying all biological organisms, we propose that\\nour metric of complexity\

        n\\nINTRODUCTION\\nA persistent question in biology is how organismal complexity\\\
        nthrough the course of evolution [1\u20135]. Although\\nchanges\\nsignificant\
        \ progress has been made in the understanding and\\nquantifying organismal\
        \ characteristics at many level of organiza-\\ntion (DNA, proteins, metabolic\
        \ networks, cellular organization,\\norgan functions,\\nindividual behavior)\
        \ much confusion remains\\nabout how to accurately quantify organismal complexity.\
        \ Several\\nintuitive proposals have been made that take into account simple\\\
        nmetrics such as the number of genes or cell types. However, these\\nsimple\
        \ measures quickly lead to conflicting conclusions [2,3]. Here\\nwe propose\
        \ a fundamentally different approach to measuring\\norganismal complexity;\
        \ as opposed to relying on bottom-up\\nmeasures such as the number of genes\
        \ an organism has, we utilize\\nan objective biological approach: natural\
        \ selection. Instead of\\nasking how complex an organism is from our own perspective,\
        \ we\\nask: how complex is an organism from the perspective of natural\\nselection?\
        \ Essentially, this is a top-down metric of organismal\\ncomplexity that we\
        \ term phenotypic complexity.\\n\\nPhenotypic complexity quantifies the number\
        \ of genetically\\nuncorrelated phenotypic traits contributing to an organism\u2019\
        s\\nfitness. A phenotypic trait contributes to an organism\u2019s fitness\\\
        nonly to the extent that natural selection acts upon that trait. Thus\\nan\
        \ organismal phenotype that is no longer under selection (for\\nexample during\
        \ an evolutionary transition from a generalist to\\nspecialist lifestyle),\
        \ although expressed by the organism, contri-\\ntwo\\nbutes nothing to organismal\
        \ complexity. Secondly,\\nphenotypes contribute to complexity, they must be\
        \ genetically\\nseparable: some mutations must exist that affect one phenotype\\\
        nbut not the other. If no such mutations exist, then although we\\nmay perceive\
        \ two phenotypes under selection, these phenotypes\\ncontribute only a single\
        \ trait\\ntoward determining phenotypic\\ncomplexity. As an example consider\
        \ the affinity of an enzyme for\\na substrate, and the rate at which that\
        \ substrate is converted to\\nproduct. If there are no mutations that affect\
        \ one of these traits but\\nnot the other, then these two phenotypes are considered\
        \ one, until\\n\\nif\\n\\nthe organism gains the genetic complexity to generate\
        \ variation in\\none phenotype without affecting the second,\\nfor example\
        \ by\\nevolving functionally separate domains in the enzyme. Phenotypic\\\
        ncomplexity is thus a combined description of how natural selection\\nperceives\
        \ organismal phenotypes and how phenotypic variation is\\ngenerated by the\
        \ organism. This concept was first articulated by\\nOrr, and followed later\
        \ by others [6\u20138]. Notably, it is similar to\\nthe amount of\\nphysical\
        \ complexity, which is a measure of\\ninformation that an organism encodes\
        \ about its environment [4,5].\\nAn important aspect of measuring complexity\
        \ in this manner is\\nthat both the organism and the environment affect the\
        \ metric. An\\norganism with many phenotypes, but living in simple environment\\\
        ncould thus be just as complex as a simpler organism in the same\\nenvironment.\
        \ For example,\\nif one organism is capable of\\nmetabolizing both lactose\
        \ and glucose, while second can\\nmetabolize only glucose, the first organism\
        \ will only be designated\\nas more complex when there is a possibility that\
        \ lactose will be\\npresent in the environment.\\n\\nAcademic Editor: Angus\

        \ e217\\n\\n\\fRecent population genetic theory [9,10] has suggested that\\\
        nphenotypic complexity is proportional to the drift load, a quantity\\nthat\
        \ describes how equilibrium mean population fitness declines\\nwith population\
        \ size. This can be intuitively understood in the\\nfollowing manner. An organism\u2019\
        s fitness is a result of how\\nsuccessfully it interacts with the environment.\
        \ As the number of\\ninteractions (traits) increases, it becomes difficult\
        \ to simultaneously\\nmaintain each one. Very large populations maintain nearly\\\
        noptimal mean population fitness regardless of phenotypic com-\\nplexity.\
        \ Small populations can maintain high average fitness only\\nwhen there are\
        \ a small number of traits (low complexity) each\\ncontributing a relatively\
        \ large amount to fitness; if there are a large\\nnumber of traits (high complexity),\
        \ each contributing only a small\\namount to fitness, then small populations\
        \ will be incapable of\\nmaintaining all of them. Thus for complex organisms,\
        \ there will be\\na large difference in mean fitness between small and large\\\
        npopulations; for simple organisms, this difference in average fitness\\nwill\
        \ be small.\\n\\nfirst\\n\\nThe phenotypic model used to link drift load to\
        \ phenotypic\\ncomplexity was\\nformalized by R. A. Fisher [11]. He\\nenvisioned\
        \ a multidimensional phenotypic space in which the\\norigin of each axis corresponded\
        \ to the most-fit or optimum\\nphenotypic value. As phenotypic values depart\
        \ from the origin,\\nfitness decreases. The manner in which fitness declines\
        \ is described\\nby a monotonically decreasing function, which may take a\
        \ variety\\nof shapes, e.g., linear, concave-up, or \u2013down. Individuals\
        \ of equal\\nfitness but different phenotypic values trace out fitness isoclines\
        \ in\\nthe space. If an organism has only two phenotypes, the phenotypic\\\
        nspace is two-dimensional and the fitness isoclines are a series of\\ncircles\
        \ centered on the origin of the axes (Fig. 1). If an organism\\nhas n number\
        \ of phenotypes, phenotypic space is n-dimensional,\\nand each fitness\\nisocline\
        \ is an n-dimensional hyper-sphere.\\nBecause of the assumed geometry of the\
        \ isoclines, this model is\\nreferred to as Fisher\u2019s Geometric Model\
        \ (FGM) of phenotypic or\\nadaptive evolution.\\n\\nA population of individuals\
        \ can be represented as a collection of\\npoints in FGM and the phenotypic\
        \ values of each point allow\\nascertainment of the fitness of each individual.\
        \ Individual fitness\\nthen determines the probability of each individual\
        \ surviving and\\nreproducing the next generation. Evolution is thus described\
        \ in\\nFGM by following the collection of points over many generations.\\\
        nTo generate novel genetic variation, mutations are drawn from an\\nassumed\
        \ distribution that is centered on the phenotypic position of\\neach individual\
        \ (Fig. 1). By never descending into genotypic space,\\nFGM is analogous to\
        \ quantitative genetics models. Both types of\\nmodels assume or require only\
        \ that a component of phenotype is\\nheritable. However, whereas quantitative\
        \ genetic models represent\\npopulations by their mean and variance, FGM is\
        \ an individual-\\nbased model in which each individual is evaluated according\
        \ to its\\nfitness.\\n\\nFGM makes a set of\\n\\ntheoretical predictions about\
        \ how\\nadaptation tends\\nthese have been\\nto occur, and many of\\ncorroborated\
        \ by experimental results. The greater frequency of\\nsmall-sized beneficial\
        \ mutations [12], the L-shaped distribution of\\nmutations fixed throughout\
        \ evolution [13], the existence of fitness\\nequilibriums [14], and the absence\
        \ of intrinsically beneficial or\\nintrinsically deleterious mutations have\
        \ all been observed during\\nlaboratory evolution, and all conform to the\
        \ conditions set forth\\nthus appears to offer a reasonable\\nunder FGM. The\
        \ model\\nframework for the study of microbial evolution.\\n\\nThe utility\
        \ of FGM lies in the fact that it does not require any\\nparticular assumptions\
        \ about the map between phenotype and\\ngenotype, and that the specific predictions\
        \ about how fitness\\nchanges during evolution appear to be robust. In the\
        \ present\\n\\nPopulation Genetic Complexity\\n\\nFigure 1. Fisher\u2019s\
        \ geometric model in two-dimensional phenotypic\\nspace. Fitness varies along\
        \ two phenotypic axes, with the maximum\\nfitness located, for convenience,\
        \ at the origin of these axes. Any\\nindividual in a population (black point)\
        \ can thus be described by its\\nphenotypic values, which determine the fitness\
        \ of that organism. At any\\nspecific fitness, there are a number of other\
        \ phenotypic combinations\\nthat have equivalent fitness; the values of these\
        \ phenotypic combina-\\ntions establish the fitness isoclines (black circle).\
        \ From the optimum,\\nthe\\nfitness declines monotonically according to the\
        \ structure of\\nlandscape (see text). Each mutation (arrow) is drawn from\
        \ a distribution\\ncentered on the phenotypic position of each individual,\
        \ resulting in\\noffspring with new phenotypic combinations and fitness values\

        \ in the laboratory.\\n\\nMODEL AND RESULTS\\nThe link between drift load\
        \ and phenotypic complexity under\\nFGM was first investigated by Hartl and\
        \ Taubes [9] (although\\nWagner and Gabriel [15] had worked previously on\
        \ a similar\\nquestion), and was later refined by Poon and Otto [10]. Recent\\\
        ntheoretical techniques from statistical physics now allow an exact\\nsolution\
        \ of FGM for several fitness functions. Sella and Hirsh [16]\\nfound that\

        \ assumed to be a linearly decreasing function of the\\nphenotypic distance\
        \ to the optimum, then we find that the average\\nfitness is given by (Methods,\
        \ Appendix A):\\n\\nFeq ne, Ne\\n\\n\xF0\\n\\n\xDE~2Ne= 2Neznez1\\n\xDE\\\

        \ fitness (drift\\nload) expressed as a fraction of the maximum attainable\
        \ fitness of\\nthe organism, ne is the effective number of dimensions of the\\\
        nphenotypic space (phenotypic complexity; see the below for a more\\ndetailed\
        \ discussion of why we term this the effective number of\\ndimensions), and\
        \ Ne is the effective population size. This confirms\\nthe results obtained\
        \ by Poon and Otto who approximated Feq(ne,\\nNe) as 2Ne/(2Ne+ne) [10].\\\
        n\\nAlthough earlier studies on FGM model have used such linear\\nfitness\
        \ functions (for the sake of mathematical simplicity), recent\\nexperimental\
        \ studies do not seem to support the use of such\\na function [17\u201319].\
        \ Linear fitness functions give rise to dramatic\\nsynergistic epistasis.\
        \ For example, a mutation that increases the\\ndistance to the optimal phenotype\
        \ by 0.1 units may decrease\\nfitness by 10% in the optimal genotype (which\
        \ by definition has\\na fitness of 1); an analogous mutation will decrease\
        \ fitness by 50%\\nin an organism with a fitness of 0.2; this mutation will\
        \ become\\nin any genotype with a fitness less than 0.1. Recent\\nlethal\\\
        nexperimental work suggests that epistasis between deleterious\\nmutations\
        \ is either antagonistic [17\u201319] or null [20]. We therefore\\ndecided\
        \ to use a family of exponential\\nfitness functions with\\na parameter that\
        \ allows control over the level and shape of\\nepistasis.\\n\\nExponential-type\
        \ Fitness Decline\\nIn an effort to explore fitness functions more compatible\
        \ with\\nexperimental data, we studied the following family of functions.\\\
        nf(d) = exp(2(dQ)),\\nin which fitness is an exponentially decaying\\nfunction\
        \ of the distance to the optimum to the power of Q. Q is\\na parameter that\
        \ modifies the concavity of the fitness decline. As\\norganisms move away\
        \ from the optimum the effect of the mutation\\ntend to have bigger effect\
        \ if Q.1 and smaller effect if Q,1. In\\nsuch a case the fitness equilibriums\

        \ is a Gaussian ellipsoid,\\nit has been shown that an appropriate change\
        \ of axes result in\\na space in which fitness isoclines are ellipsoid while\
        \ the mutation\\ncloud is circular [21]. Hence it seems that asymmetry in\

        nUsing methods from statistical physics, we can find the distribution\\nof\

        \ fitness equilibriums were observed, confirming that\\nevolution occurred\
        \ in a manner compatible with the assumptions\\nof FGM. From these populations\
        \ we obtained 21 measures of\\nequilibrium fitness at five different population\
        \ sizes. Every transfer\\ncorresponded roughly to five phage generations and\
        \ effective\\npopulation size was then approximated to five times the number\
        \ of\\nplaques transferred (the harmonic mean).\\n\\nTo estimate the curvature\
        \ of the fitness function we performed\\na mutation accumulation analysis\
        \ for high and low fitness clones\\nand showed that the distribution of deleterious\
        \ mutations was\\nsimilar at both ends of the fitness range spanning a 300-fold\\\
        ndifference. This suggests that there is very little curvature of the\\nfitness\
        \ function.\\n\\nWe used a second set of data from the literature, in which\\\
        npopulations were evolved for 20 transfers at different effective\\nsizes.\
        \ Novella et al. [22] evolved four clones of vesicular stomatitis\\nvirus\
        \ (VSV) using plaque-to-plaque transfers of sizes two, five, and\\nfitness\\\
        n30. They also observed a population size-dependant\\nconvergence. Although\
        \ the time for convergence was relatively\\nshort (40 viral generations),\
        \ several populations experienced no\\nsignificant increases or decreases\
        \ in fitness over all replicates at\\na given population size, suggesting\
        \ that those population were at or\\nnear an equilibrium fitness value. We\
        \ used the fitness estimates\\nfrom 24 populations evolved at population sizes\
        \ of two, five and\\n30. Every transfer corresponded to roughly two viral\
        \ generations\\nand effective population size was thus approximated as two\
        \ times\\nthe number of viral plaques transferred.\\n\\nAdditionally, an impressive\
        \ set of data using site directed\\nmutagenesis in VSV suggests that the concavity\
        \ of fitness function\\nis slightly upward [19]. However, in further analyses\
        \ we estimate\\nQ as 1 for both the phage and the virus, as no clear departure\
        \ from\\n1 has been observed in either case.\\n\\nEstimates of Phenotypic\
        \ Complexity for VSV and\\nwX174\\nWe applied the maximum likelihood estimator\
        \ to the experimental\\nestimates of population fitness for wX174 and VSV,\
        \ and using\\na likelihood ratio test we defined 95% confidence intervals\
        \ (CI),\\nwhich we list here in parentheses. For wX174 we found ne/Q = 45\\\
        n(42249), and fref = 1.245 (1.2321.26), whereas for VSV we found\\nne/Q =\
        \ 10 (8212) and fref = 1.98 (1.9422.05) (Fig. 3). In both of\\nthese cases,\
        \ fref is calculated per generation relative to the ancestral\\nvirus for\
        \ wX174 and relative to a reference strain for VSV. As no\\nstrong signature\
        \ of curvature in the fitness surface has been found\\nfor either virus, we\
        \ assume that Q is approximately one.\\n\\nDISCUSSION\\nTo understand how\
        \ biological complexity changes during the\\ncourse of evolution, a metric\
        \ is needed. Previously, measures such\\nas the number of genes, cell types\
        \ or metabolic processes have\\nthey often lead to incongruent results.\\\
        nbeen proposed, but\\nOrganisms with more cell types do not necessarily have\
        \ more\\ngenes. Here we suggest that a metric unifying biological systems\\\
        nhas not been appropriately identified. To circumvent this problem,\\nwe have\
        \ developed a metric of biological complexity termed\\nphenotypic complexity\
        \ (ne). We have quantified this metric in the\\nviruses wX174 and VSV by utilizing\
        \ a population genetic model\\nthat describes how phenotypic complexity affects\
        \ the drift load that\\na population experiences.\\n\\nPhenotypic complexity\
        \ (ne)\\n\\nis a measure of the number of\\nthat are acted upon by\\ngenetically\
        \ uncorrelated phenotypes\\nnatural selection. Because Darwinian evolution\
        \ through natural\\nselection is\\nthe fundamental element unifying all biological\\\
        norganisms, we propose that ne is potentially a more relevant\\nmetric than\
        \ those previously suggested.\\n\\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org\\n\\n4\\n\\\
        nFebruary 2007 |\\n\\nIssue 2 | e217\\n\\n\\fRobustness of the Model\\nUsing\
        \ recent theoretical results we have analytically quantified the\\ndependency\
        \ of the drift load (equilibrium fitness) on the effective\\npopulation size\
        \ and phenotypic complexity. The linear fitness\\nfunction that has been employed\
        \ previously to simplify the\\nmathematical analyses is no longer necessary.\
        \ Such a function\\nmakes strong assumptions about the form of the fitness\
        \ landscape;\\nspecifically, mutational effects become very large as fitness\
        \ is\\nreduced. Thus at low fitness most mutations are either lethal or of\\\
        nvery large effect, a scenario which is incompatible with what we\\nhave previously\
        \ observed [14].\\n\\nWe have therefore studied a more general family of fitness\\\
        nfunctions of the form f(d) = exp(2(dQ)), and found that Feq(Ne,\\nne) = (12(2?Ne21)21)(ne/Q).\
        \ It appears that this equation remains\\nvalid over a much wider range of\
        \ conditions than those used in the\\ncanonical FGM, in which mutations are\
        \ required to be isotropic\\nand fitness isoclines are symmetric about the\
        \ origin. An interesting\\nfeature of this formula is that it does not require\
        \ a model in which\\nmutations can affect all phenotypic traits simultaneously.\
        \ In the\\ninitial formulation of FGM, all phenotypic axes intersect at the\\\
        norigin of each axis. This original FGM can be modified slightly\\nsuch that\
        \ some phenotypes are grouped into separate phenotypic\\nmodules, and within\
        \ a module, all phenotypes again intersect at\\neach other\u2019s origin.\
        \ Any mutation that occurs within a module can\\naffect only other phenotypes\
        \ within that module, and none that lie\\noutside of it (i.e. there is no\
        \ pleiotropy between modules, an idea\\nsimilar to previous conceptions of\
        \ modularity [23]). Using the\\nmore general description of the equilibrium\
        \ drift load that we have\\nderived above, a phenotypic landscape a composed\
        \ of a single\\nmodule with ne dimensions has the same drift load function\
        \ as\\na landscape composed of m independent modules of size ne,i with\\nSi\
        \ ne,i = ne because we have\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n1{ 2Ne{1\\n\xDE\\n\\n\xF0\\n\\\

        \ underlying FGM.\\n\\nOther Attempts to Estimate Phenotypic Complexity\\\
        nRecently, another theoretical study developed a framework to\\nestimate phenotypic\
        \ complexity [21]. The model developed used\\npredictions on the distribution\
        \ of mutational effects to estimate\\ncomplexity. This analysis, which is\
        \ completely independent from\\nours, found an interesting correlation between\
        \ gene number and\\ncomplexity in a variety of organisms ranging from a virus\
        \ to C.\\nelegans. However, for all the organisms for which enough data\\\
        nthe number of phenotypic\\nexisted to perform the analysis,\\ndimensions\
        \ estimated was very small; 0.21 phenotypic dimensions\\nfor E. coli, 1.07\
        \ in VSV, 1\u20132 for S. cerevisiae, and 2\u20133 for D.\\nmelanogaster and\
        \ C. elegans. We think that several effects may limit\\nthe predictive quality\
        \ such a method. Firstly, mutation accumu-\\nlation methods and the inherent\
        \ noise in fitness estimates are very\\ndifferent across species and comparison\
        \ across species are thus\\ndifficult. One illustration of this is the large\
        \ variability in fitness\\nestimates for mutations in a single species using\
        \ two methods: in\\nVSV earlier estimates (using Bateman-Mukai estimates)\
        \ predicted\\na 0.002 mean fitness effect per mutation, while more recent\
        \ and\\naccurate estimates (which introduced each mutation individually)\\\
        nbrought the estimate it to 14% (a 70-fold difference). Secondly,\\nneutral\
        \ mutations are not considered in the model developed by\\nMartin and Lenormand.\
        \ However, part of the mutation produced\\n\\nPopulation Genetic Complexity\\\

        \ genes useless in laboratory\\nconditions and will\\nin the\\ncalculation\
        \ of mean fitness effects of mutations even if they do\\nnot affect any phenotype\
        \ in the laboratory environment. Third,\\ncontrary to our model, if phenotypes\
        \ are organized in different\\nmodules (as many data suggest), their model\
        \ will provide different\\nestimates; in other words, their model requires\
        \ that all traits can be\\nsimultaneously affected by a single mutations.\
        \ All these considera-\\ntions suggest that a second independent model should\
        \ be used to\\nestimate phenotypic complexity.\\n\\nOne of the central FGM\
        \ hypotheses that we have so far not\\naddressed is the single-peaked nature\
        \ of the landscape. Although\\nFGM contains few assumptions about the nature\
        \ of the genotypic\\nlandscape, the model explicitly requires a phenotypic\
        \ landscape\\ncontaining a single peak; without this, then the fitness function,\\\
        nf(d), cannot be described by a decreasing function. However,\\nrecent experimental\
        \ evidence over large evolutionary time scales\\nstrongly suggests that while\
        \ the genotypic landscape may contain\\nmultiple peaks, the phenotypic landscape\
        \ is generally much less\\ncomplex. Several experimental studies using microbes\
        \ have shown\\nthat a considerable amount of phenotypic convergence occurs\\\
        nduring evolution [24\u201327], even when organisms begin from\\ndifferent\
        \ starting points in the landscape [28]. These phenomena\\nwould only be expected\
        \ if the phenotypic landscape exhibited\\na single-peak. However, the evidence\
        \ for ruggedness in the genetic\\nlandscape is also substantial, especially\
        \ in experiments that have\\nlooked at bacterial evolution of resistance to\
        \ antibiotics [29]. In\\nthis case, the fitness relationships between the\
        \ wild type genotypes,\\nresistant genotypes, compensated resistant genotypes,\
        \ and sensitive\\ngenotypes bearing the compensatory mutation exhibit high\
        \ levels\\nof epistasis, characteristic of a rugged genetic landscape. In\
        \ other\\nin which the cost of resistance was associated with\\nstudies\\\
        na phenotype [30],\\nfitness restoration to wild-type level was\\nsometimes\
        \ observed and, more importantly for our concern, it\\nthe phenotypic damage\\\
        nwas associated with a restoration of\\nthe resistance mutation\\nassociated\
        \ with the occurrence of\\n(transcription efficiency of\\nrifampicin resistant\
        \ mutants was\\nrestored back to the level observed in rifampicin sensitive\
        \ strain).\\nThis also suggests the singularity of the phenotypic optimum,\\\
        nalthough different genetic combinations may underlie this\\nis focusing neither\
        \ on the\\noptimum. However, as our model\\ngenetic nature of the adaptive\
        \ landscape, nor on the rate of\\nadaptation (ruggedness means that several\
        \ mutations could be\\nneeded to restore the effect of one) it should not\
        \ be too sensitive to\\nthe small level ruggedness of the genetic landscape\
        \ described so\\nfar.\\n\\nThe Concept of Phenotypic Complexity\\nAs discussed\
        \ previously, the quantity denoted by ne is the number\\nof genetically uncorrelated\
        \ phenotypes that are influenced by the\\naction of natural selection. The\
        \ dimensions enumerated by ne are\\nthus genetically orthogonal to each other,\
        \ and analogous to the\\naxes needed to describe the variation among multiple\
        \ phenotypes\\nmeasured on a collection of individuals and mutants in a principal\\\
        ncomponent analysis. However, the number of axes enumerated by\\nne is filtered\
        \ by natural selection, while in a PCA analysis the\\nnumber of axes is limited\
        \ only by the number of independent\\nphenotypes\\nthat are measured. Because\
        \ each phenotype is\\noptimized at a value determined by each organism\u2019\
        s ecological\\nenvironment, there is a dependence of phenotypic complexity\
        \ on\\nthe complexity of\\nthe ecological niche experienced by each\\norganism;\
        \ if natural selection does not act on a phenotype, then\\nthat phenotype\
        \ does not contribute to the complexity metric.\\nFinally, although the estimates\
        \ of ne arise from an idealized model\\n\\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org\\n\\\
        n5\\n\\nFebruary 2007 |\\n\\nIssue 2 | e217\\n\\n\\fof phenotypic evolution;\
        \ as Orr suggested previously, estimates of\\nphenotypic complexity using\
        \ FGM can be viewed as \u2018\u2018effective\u2019\u2019\\nestimates of phenotypic\
        \ complexity [6]. This concept is analogous\\nto the concept in population\
        \ genetics of effective population size,\\nNe, in which two populations with\
        \ different numbers of individuals\\nand different sex ratios might have the\
        \ same effective population\\nsize and therefore respond similarly to the\
        \ different population\\ngenetic forces. Thus two organisms, although they\
        \ may differ in\\nboth the underlying genetic mechanisms and in the complexity\
        \ of\\nthe environment in which they live, may have similar phenotypic\\ncomplexities.\
        \ The utility of the concept lies not in the implications\\nit makes about\
        \ specific phenotypes or genetic details, but in that it\\nenables a general\
        \ quantification of how an organism is affected by\\nnatural selection (the\
        \ complexity with which natural selection acts),\\nand furthermore, how this\
        \ action affects\\nthe evolutionary\\ndynamics of that organism [6].\\n\\\
        nViral Estimates of Phenotypic Complexity\\nUnsurprisingly, our estimates\
        \ of phenotypic complexity are orders\\nof magnitude smaller than either the\
        \ number of nucleotides or\\neven the number of amino acids encoded by the\
        \ genomes of these\\norganisms (5386 bp and 11,161bp in wX174 and VSV, respec-\\\
        ntively). This agrees with the concept of phenotypic complexity that\\nwe\
        \ have defined. Although mutations that occur at one nucleotide\\nor amino\
        \ acid do not affect\\nthey are\\ngenetically separable phenotypes), it is\
        \ clearly unlikely that each\\nnucleotide or amino acid is independently acted\
        \ up by natural\\nselection. Secondly, each estimate of complexity is greater\
        \ than the\\nnumber of genes encoded by each virus (11 and 5 for wX174 and\\\
        nVSV, respectively). The presence of multiple functional domains\\nwithin\
        \ a single protein is consistent with an estimate of complexity\\nthat is\
        \ greater than the number of encoded proteins.\\n\\nthose at another (i.e.\\\
        n\\nAlthough we have only two estimates, we can briefly consider\\nthem from\
        \ a comparative standpoint: although the genome size of\\nwX174 is half of\
        \ VSV, our estimate of phenotypic complexity\\nquantifies wX174 as being approximately\
        \ four-fold more complex.\\nIt is notable, then, that wX174 contains approximately\
        \ twice the\\nnumber of genes as VSV. Additionally, the lifestyle of wX174\
        \ is\\narguably much more elaborate than that of VSV. wX174 interacts\\nwith\
        \ several host factors in order to perform transcription and\\nreplication;\
        \ 13 host factors are required for replication alone [31].\\nThis can be contrasted\
        \ with VSV, in which transcription and\\nreplication are similar processes,\
        \ both performed by the viral\\npolymerase. Few host\\nfactors (and thus few\
        \ interactions) are\\nnecessary at all during the entire life cycle of VSV\
        \ [32].\\n\\nThese estimates suggest that, for very simple organisms such\
        \ as\\nviruses, phenotypic complexity correlates well with the number of\\\
        ngenes in an organism, and more specifically, with the number of\\ninteractions\
        \ characteristic of that organism [2]. This observation\\nsupports the idea\
        \ that phenotypic complexity depends on the\\ninteractions between an organism\
        \ and its environment. Genome\\nsize in itself seems to be a poor correlate\
        \ of phenotypic complexity,\\na notable result in consideration of the very\
        \ small genome sizes of\\nthese organisms. Whether\\nsuch correlations or\
        \ absence of\\ncorrelation with gene number or genome length would hold for\\\
        nmore complex organisms remains an open question. Nevertheless,\\nby studying\
        \ very simple organisms, we have shown that the use of\\ndrift load could\
        \ be used to estimate complexity in a novel and\\nconsistent way. We now propose\
        \ that such a method could be\\nhelpful to identify and quantify the strongest\
        \ determinants of\\nbiological complexity of higher organisms.\\n\\nAlthough\
        \ the theory presented here appears to be quite robust,\\nit is too early\
        \ to conclude that it is an accurate reflection of the\\nunderlying biology.\
        \ To be studied in an FGM framework,\\n\\nPopulation Genetic Complexity\\\
        n\\nfor population size-dependent\\n\\norganisms need to present at least\
        \ one phenotypic property to\\nselection. Additionally, populations, even\
        \ those of very small size,\\nis explicitly\\nshould evolve towards a fitness\
        \ equilibrium that\\ndependent on population size. We found data in the literature\\\
        nconsistent with this expectation for one organism, VSV. We now\\nprovide\
        \ further support\\nfitness\\nequilibria by evolving populations of the bacteriophage\
        \ wX174.\\nTogether, these two data sets suggest that evolutionary analyses\\\
        nusing an FGM framework are a valid approach. Moreover, the use\\nof very\
        \ simple organisms such as viruses is useful for gaining insight\\ninto metrics\
        \ of complexity, as for such simple organisms, gene\\nnumber is likely to\
        \ be a very good correlate of organismal\\ncomplexity, and this should be\
        \ reflected by the metric. Although\\nour observations are currently limited\
        \ to two viral species, it is\\n(i.e. population size-\\nclear that\\nfrom\
        \ both a qualitative level\\n(that the\\ndependent fitness equilibria), and\
        \ a quantitative level\\nthe\\nthat\\nnumber of phenotypic dimensions are\

        ndrift load and phenotypic complexity in a greater number of\\norganisms is\
        \ needed before further conclusions can be drawn.\\n\\nConclusions\\nHere\
        \ we have presented a top-down approach to quantifying\\nbiological complexity.\
        \ This can be contrasted with previously\\nproposed metrics of complexity,\
        \ which have relied on physically\\nmeasurable quantities of the organism\
        \ (bottom-up approaches).\\nTwo important conceptual differences separate\
        \ these two ap-\\nproaches. Most importantly, phenotypic complexity is dependent\\\
        non both the organism and the environmental context. An\\norganism is not\
        \ complex because it has many measurable\\nphenotypes; it is complex because\
        \ it has many phenotypes on\\nwhich natural selection acts. Secondly, phenotypic\
        \ complexity\\ndoes not rely on artificially constructed concepts such as\
        \ genes\\n[33]. As an example, if two genes are deemed to be of equal\\nsuch\
        \ a\\ncomplexity because they are functionally equivalent,\\nmeasure necessarily\
        \ ignores the subtle ways in which each may\\nbe regulated, or spliced, or\
        \ expressed within the cell. Quantify-\\ning such multiple layers of complexity\
        \ is difficult if the metric\\nrelies on physically measurable quantities.\\\
        n\\nHowever, phenotypic complexity remains an inherently abstract\\nmetric.\
        \ It cannot aid in identifying the specific characteristics\\ncontributing\
        \ to the complexity of an organism. Instead, it addresses\\nthe complexity\
        \ with which natural selection views an organism, and\\nthe complexity with\
        \ which an organism is capable of generating\\nnovel phenotypic variation.\
        \ For this reason, testing how phenotypic\\ncomplexity compares to more traditional\
        \ metrics of complexity (for\\nexample, the numbers of genes, protein interactions,\
        \ or cellular\\npathways) may provide significant insight into biological\
        \ systems.\\nFinally, phenotypic complexity (and the resulting equilibrium\
        \ drift\\nload) affords a unique opportunity to contrast the action of natural\\\
        nselection between different organisms or different environments in\\na very\
        \ general and unconstrained manner.\\n\\nMETHODS\\nViral Evolution\\nThe details\
