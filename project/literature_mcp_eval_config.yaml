  expected_output: 'SHE diagnosis is primarily based on the clinical history. The
    absence of clear interictal and ictal EEG correlates does not exclude the diagnosis.
    Three different levels of diagnostic certainty have been identified: (1) Witnessed
    (possible), based on the observation by a witness of the core clinical features,
    but without other sources of evidence. (2) Video-documented (clinical), which
    involves a high quality video recording of at least one (but preferably two) stereotyped
    episode. (3) VEEG-documented (confirmed), which requires the video-polygraphic
    recording of at least one but preferably two stereotyped events with documented
    ictal discharge or interictal epileptiform abnormalities.'

  expected_output: However, phenotypic complexity remains an inherently abstract metric.
    It cannot aid in identifying the specific characteristics contributing to the
    complexity of an organism. Instead, it addresses the complexity with which natural
    selection views an organism, and the complexity with which an organism is capable
    of generating novel phenotypic variation. For this reason, testing how phenotypic
    complexity compares to more traditional metrics of complexity (for example, the
    numbers of genes, protein interactions, or cellular pathways) may provide significant
    insight into biological systems. Finally, phenotypic complexity (and the resulting
    equilibrium drift load) affords a unique opportunity to contrast the action of
    natural selection between different organisms or different environments in a very
    general and unconstrained manner.

  expected_output: Nanodiamonds and Au NPs were introduced into WS1 cells via silicon
    nanowire-mediated delivery15. Silicon nanowires were treated with 3-amino-propyltrimethoxysilane
    to present NH2 functionality on the surface, and nanodiamonds / Au NPs were subsequently
    attached via electrostatic binding. Afterwards, human embryonic fibroblast WS1
    cells were plated on the silicon nanowire substrates and cultured overnight. The
    cells were removed by trypsin treatment and re-plated on a glass slide with lithographically
    defined strip lines for ESR measurements. The samples were stained with calcein-AM
    and ethidium homodimer-1 for the live/dead assay.

    to study the design of efficient spaced seeds for protein sequence search (see
    [6]), as well as to combine spaced seeds with other techniques such as seed families
    [17, 20, 16] or the group hit criterion [19].
