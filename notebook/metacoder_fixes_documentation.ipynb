    "# Metacoder Bug Fixes for Goose and Claude Coders\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook documents critical bug fixes made to the `metacoder` framework that prevented proper MCP extension loading in Goose evaluations and caused evaluation crashes in Claude evaluations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Date:** 2025-11-03  \n",
    "**Version:** metacoder (installed via pip)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Two critical bugs were discovered and fixed:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Goose MCP Extension Loading Failure** - 100% failure rate → 10% pass rate after fix\n",
    "2. **Claude Evaluation Crash Bug** - Crashes on first error → Graceful error handling after fix\n",
    "\n",
    "Both fixes have patch files ready for upstream contribution to the metacoder project."

    "## Part 1: Goose Coder - MCP Extension Loading Bug\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "**Symptom:** All 100 Goose evaluation tests showed \"No extensions available to enable\" even though MCP extensions were properly configured in the YAML config files.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Impact:** 0% of tests could use MCP tools → All literature retrieval tasks failed\n",
    "\n",
    "**Evidence from logs:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Using tool: platform__search_available_extensions with arguments: {}\n",
    "Result: \"No extensions available to enable\"\n",
    "Message: \"I don't currently have access to any extensions\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Root Cause Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "**Discovery:** Reading the [Goose CLI documentation](https://block.github.io/goose/docs/guides/goose-cli-commands/) revealed:\n",
    "\n",
    "> The `goose run` command does NOT load extensions from config files.  \n",
    "> Extensions must be passed as command-line arguments using `--with-extension`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why metacoder failed:**\n",
    "- Metacoder built the command as: `goose run -t \"task text\"`\n",
    "- Expected Goose to load extensions from `~/.config/goose/config.yaml` or local configs\n",
    "- But `goose run` (non-interactive mode) ignores config files for extensions\n",
    "- Required format: `goose run -t \"text\" --with-extension \"uvx artl-mcp\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Fix\n",
    "\n",
    "**File:** `.venv/lib/python3.10/site-packages/metacoder/coders/goose.py`  \n",
    "**Location:** Lines 216-232 (in the `run()` method)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Added code:**"

    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "**Symptom:** Claude-code evaluations crashed on the first error instead of marking the test as failed and continuing.\n",

    "- `raise ValueError` crashes the parent process (metacoder evaluation)\n",
    "- No way to gracefully handle individual test failures\n",
    "- Makes it impossible to run full evaluation suites (100 tests)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Correct behavior:**\n",
    "- Mark the individual test as failed\n",

    "## Lessons Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Documentation is Critical\n",
    "- The Goose bug was only discovered by carefully reading the CLI documentation\n",
    "- Config file behavior differs between interactive (`goose session`) and non-interactive (`goose run`) modes\n",
    "- This difference was not obvious from the code alone\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Error Handling Philosophy  \n",
    "- **Evaluation frameworks should NEVER crash on test failures**\n",
    "- Individual test errors should be logged and marked as failed\n",
    "- Only crash on infrastructure failures (auth, missing files, etc.)\n",
    "- Partial results are better than no results\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Environment Variable Conventions\n",
    "- Goose uses `GOOSE_PROVIDER__API_KEY` (double underscore)\n",
    "- Claude uses `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (standard)\n",
    "- Metacoder needs to map between these conventions\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Command-Line vs Config Files\n",
    "- Can't assume all tools load configs the same way\n",
    "- CLI mode often has different behavior than interactive mode\n",
    "- Command-line arguments take precedence over config files\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Testing Evaluation Frameworks\n",
    "- Run small test suites first (4-5 tests)\n",
    "- Verify extensions/tools are loading before full run\n",
    "- Check early test results for warning signs\n",
    "- Use verbose logging during development"

    "## Recommendations for Upstream\n",
    "\n",
    "### For Metacoder Project\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Apply both patches** to fix critical bugs\n",
    "2. **Add integration tests** for:\n",
    "   - Goose extension loading via `--with-extension`\n",
    "   - Claude error handling (don't crash on first error)\n",
    "   - Environment variable mapping for different agents\n",
    "3. **Document agent-specific quirks:**\n",
    "   - Goose: `run` mode requires `--with-extension` flags\n",
    "   - Claude: Distinguish auth errors from task errors\n",
    "4. **Add checkpointing** for long evaluations:\n",
    "   - Save partial results every N tests\n",
    "   - Allow resume from checkpoint\n",
    "5. **Improve logging:**\n",
    "   - Log extension loading success/failure\n",
    "   - Log environment variable configuration\n",
    "   - Distinguish recoverable vs fatal errors\n",
    "\n",
    "### For Goose Project\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Document `goose run` behavior more prominently**\n",
    "   - Explain difference from `goose session`\n",
    "   - Show examples of `--with-extension` usage\n",
    "   - Clarify what config files affect in CLI mode\n",
    "2. **Consider loading extensions from config in CLI mode**\n",
    "   - Would simplify integration with evaluation frameworks\n",
    "   - Could add `--no-config-extensions` flag to opt out\n",
    "3. **Standardize environment variables:**\n",
    "   - Consider supporting both `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and `GOOSE_PROVIDER__API_KEY`\n",
    "   - Document the precedence clearly"
